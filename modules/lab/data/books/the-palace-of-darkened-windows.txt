    THE PALACE OF DARKENED WINDOWS


    CHAPTER I


    THE EAVESDROPPER


A one-eyed man with a stuffed crocodile upon his head paused before

the steps of Cairo's gayest hotel and his expectant gaze ranged

hopefully over the thronged verandas. It was afternoon tea time; the

band was playing and the crowd was at its thickest and brightest.

The little tables were surrounded by travelers of all nations, some

in tourist tweeds and hats with the inevitable green veils; others,

those of more leisurely sojourns, in white serges and diaphanous

frocks and flighty hats fresh from the Rue de la Paix.


It was the tweed-clad groups that the crocodile vender scanned for a

purchaser of his wares and harshly and unintelligibly exhorted to

buy, but no answering gaze betokened the least desire to bring back

a crocodile to the loved ones at home. Only Billy B. Hill grinned

delightedly at him, as Billy grinned at every merry sight of the

spectacular East, and Billy shook his head with cheerful

convincingosity, so the crocodile merchant moved reluctantly on

before the importunities of the Oriental rug peddler at his heels.


Then he stopped. His turbaned head, topped by the grotesque,

glassy-eyed, glistening-toothed monster, revolved slowly as the

Arab's single eye steadily followed a couple who passed by him up

the hotel steps. Billy, struck by the man's intense interest, craned

forward and saw that one of the couple, now exchanging farewells at

the top of the steps, was a girl, a pretty girl, and an American,

and the other was an officer in a uniform of considerable green and

gold, and obviously a foreigner.


He might be any kind of a foreigner, according to Billy's lax

distinctions, that was olive of complexion and very black of hair

and eyes. Slender and of medium height, he carried himself with an

assurance that bordered upon effrontery, and as he bowed himself

down the steps he flashed upon his former companion a smile of

triumph that included and seemed to challenge the verandaful of

observers.


The girl turned and glanced casually about at the crowded groups

that were like little samples of all the nations of the earth, and

with no more than a faint awareness of the battery of eyes upon her

she passed toward the tables by the railing. She was a slim little

fairy of a girl, as fresh as a peach blossom, with a cloud of pale

gold hair fluttering round her pretty face, which lent her a most

alluring and deceptive appearance of ethereal mildness. She had a

soft, satiny, rose-leaf skin which was merely flushed by the heat of

the Egyptian day, and her eyes were big and very, very blue. There

were touches of that blue here and there upon her creamy linen suit,

and a knot of blue upon her parasol and a twist of blue about her

Panama hat, so that she could not be held unconscious of the

flagrantly bewitching effect. Altogether she was as upsettingly

pretty a young person as could be seen in a year's journey, and the

glances of the beholders brightened vividly at her approach.


There was one conspicuous exception. This exception was sitting

alone at the large table which backed Billy's tiny table into a

corner by the railing, and as the girl arrived at that large table

the exception arose and greeted her with an air of glacial chill.


"Oh! Am I so terribly late?" said the girl with great pleasantness,

and arched brows of surprise at the two other places at the table

before which used tea things were standing.


"My sister and Lady Claire had an appointment, so they were obliged

to have their tea and leave," stated the young man, with an air of

politely endeavoring to conceal his feelings, and failing

conspicuously in the endeavor. "They were most sorry."


"Oh, so am I!" declared the girl, in clear and contrite tones which

carried perfectly to Billy B. Hill's enchanted ears. "I never

dreamed they would have to hurry away."


"They did not hurry, as you call it," and the young man glanced at

his watch, "for nearly an hour. It was a disappointment to them."


"Pin-pate!" thought Billy, with intense disgust. "Is he kicking at a

two-some?"


"And have you had your tea, too?" inquired the girl, with an air of

tantalizing unconcern.


"I waited, naturally, for my guest."


"Oh, not naturally!" she laughed. "It must be very unnatural for

you to wait for anything. And you must be starving. So am I—do you

think there are enough cakes left for the two of us?"


Without directly replying, the young man gave the order to the

red-fezzed Arab in a red-girdled white robe who was removing the

soiled tea things, and he assisted the girl into a chair and sat

down facing her. Their profiles were given to the shameless Billy,

and he continued his rapt observations.


He had immediately recognized the girl as a vision he had seen

fluttering around the hotel with an incongruously dismal

couple of unyouthful ladies, and he had mentally affixed a

magnate's-only-daughter-globe-trotting-with-elderly-friends label to

her.


The young man he could not place so definitely. There were a good

many tall, aristocratic young Englishmen about, with slight stoops

and incipient moustaches. This particular Englishman had hair that

was pronouncedly sandy, and Billy suddenly recollected that in

lunching at the Savoy the other day he had noticed that young

Englishman in company with a sandy-haired lady, not so young, and a

decidedly pretty dark-haired girl—it was the girl, of course, who

had fixed the group in Billy's crowded impressions. He decided that

these ladies were the sister and Lady Claire—and Lady Claire, he

judiciously concluded, certainly had nothing on young America.


Young America was speaking. "Don't look so thunderous!" she

complained to her irate host. "How do you know I didn't plan to be

late so as to have you all to myself?"


This was too derisive for endurance. A dull red burned through the

tan on the young Englishman's cheeks and crept up to meet the

corresponding warmth of his hair. A leash within him snapped.


"It is simply inconceivable!" burst from him, and then he shut his

jaw hard, as if only one last remnant of will power kept a seething

volcano, from explosion.


"What is?"


"How any girl—in Cairo, of all places!" he continued to explode in

little snorts.


"You are speaking of—?" she suggested.


"Of your walking with that fellow—in broad daylight!"


"Would it have been better in the gloaming?"


The sweet restraint in the young thing's manner was supernatural. It

was uncanny. It should have warned the red-headed young man, but

oblivious of danger signals, he was plunging on, full steam ahead.


"It isn't as if you didn't know—hadn't been warned."


"You have been so kind," the girl murmured, and poured a cup of tea

the Arab had placed at her elbow.


The young man ignored his. The color burned hotter and hotter in his

face. Even his hair looked redder.


"The look he gave up here was simply outrageous—a grin of insolent

triumph. I'd like to have laid my cane across him!"


The girl's cup clicked against the saucer. "You are horrid!" she

declared. "When we were on shipboard Captain Kerissen was very

popular among the passengers and I talked with him whenever I cared

to. Everyone did. Now that I am in his native city I see no reason

to stalk past him when we happen to be going in the same direction.

He is a gentleman of rank, a relative of the Khedive who is ruling

this country—under your English advice—and he is——"


"A Turk!" gritted out the young man.


"A Turk and proud of it! His mother was French, however, and he was

educated at Oxford and he is as cosmopolitan as any man I ever met.

It's unusual to meet anyone so close to the reigning family, and it

gives one a wonderful insight into things off the beaten track——"


"The beaten—damn!" said the young man, and Billy's heart went out

to him. "Oh, I beg pardon, but you—he—I—" So many things occurred

to him to say at one and the same time that he emitted a snort of

warring and incoherent syllables. Finally, with supreme control, "Do

you know that your 'gentleman of rank' couldn't set foot in a

gentleman's club in this country?"


"I think it's mean!" retorted the girl, her blue eyes very bright

and indignant. "You English come here and look down on even the

highest members of the country you are pretending to assist. Why do

you? When he was at Oxford he went into your English homes."


"English madhouses—for admitting him."


A brief silence ensued.


The girl ate a cake. It was a nice cake, powdered with almonds, but

she ate it obliviously. The angry red shone rosily in her cheeks.


The young man took a hasty drink of his tea, which had grown cold

in its cup, and pushed it away. Obstinately he rushed on in his mad

career.


"I simply cannot understand you!" he declared.


"Does it matter?" said she, and bit an almond's head off.


"It would be bad enough, in any city, but in Cairo—! To permit him

to insult you with his company, alone, upon the streets!"


"When you have said insult you have said a little too much," she

returned in a small, cold voice of war. "Is there anything against

Captain Kerissen personally?"


"Who knows anything about any of those fellows? They are all

alike—with half a dozen wives locked up behind their barred

windows."


"He isn't married."


"How do you know?"


"I—inferred it."


The Englishman snorted: "According to his custom, you know, it isn't

the proper thing to mention his ladies in public."


"You are frightfully unjust. Captain Kerissen's customs are the

customs of the civilized world, and he is very anxious to have his

country become modernized."


"Then let him send his sisters out walking with fellow officers....

For him to walk beside you——"


"He was following the custom of my country," said the girl, with

maddening superiority. "Since I am an American girl——"


The young Englishman said a horrible thing. He said it with immense

feeling.


"American goose!" he uttered, then stopped short. Precipitately he

floundered into explanation:


"I beg your pardon, but, you know, when you say such bally nonsense

as that—! An American girl has no more business to be imprudent

than a Patagonian girl. You have no idea how these people

regard——"


"Oh, don't apologize," murmured the girl, with charming sweetness.

"I don't mind what you say—not in the least."


The outraged man was not so befuddled but what he saw those danger

signals now. They glimmered scarlet upon his vision, but his blood

was up and he plunged on to destruction with the extraordinary

remark, "But isn't there a reason why you should?"


She gazed at him in mock reflection, as if mulling this striking

thought presented for her consideration, but her eyes were too

sparkly and her cheeks too poppy-pink to substantiate the reflective

pose.


"N-no," she said at last, with an impertinent little drawl. "I can't

seem to think of any."


He did not pause for innuendo. "You mean you don't give a piastre

what I think?"


"Not half a piastre," she confirmed, in flat defiance.


The young man looked at her. He was over the brink of ruin now;

nothing remained of the interesting little affair of the past three

weeks but a mangled and lamentable wreck at the bottom of a deep

abyss.


Perhaps a shaft of compunction touched her flinty soul at the sight

of his aghast and speechless face, for she had the grace to look

away. Her gaze encountered the absorbed and excited countenance of

Billy B. Hill, and the poppy-pink of her cheeks became poppy-red

and she turned her head sharply away. She rose, catching up her

gloves and parasol.


"Thank you so much for your tea," she said in a lowered tone to her

unfortunate host. "I've had a delicious time.... I'm sorry if I

disappointed you by not cowering before your disapproval. Oh, don't

bother to come in with me—I know my way to the lift and the band is

going to play God Save the King and they need you to stand up and

make a showing."


Billy B. Hill stared across at the abandoned young man with supreme

sympathy and intimate understanding. He was a nice and right-minded

young man and she was an utter minx. She was the daughter of

unreason and the granddaughter of folly. She needed, emphatically

needed, to be shown. But this Englishman, with his harsh and

violently antagonizing way of putting things, was clearly not the

man for the need. It took a lighter touch—the hand of iron in the

velvet glove, as it were. It took a keener spirit, a softer humor.


Billy threw out his chest and drew himself up to his full five feet

eleven and one-half inches, as he passed indoors and sought the

hotel register, for he felt within himself the true equipment for

that delicate mission. He fairly panted to be at it.


Fate was amiable. The hotel clerk, coerced with a couple of

gold-banded ones with the real fragrance, permitted Billy to learn

that the blue-eyed one's name was Beecher, Arlee Beecher, and that

she was in the company of two ladies entitled Mrs. and Miss

Eversham. The Miss Eversham was quite old enough to be entitled

otherwise. They were occupied, the clerk reported, with nerves and

dissatisfaction. Miss Beecher appeared occupied in part—with a

correspondence that would swamp a foreign office.


Now it is always a question whether being at the same hotel does or

does not constitute an introduction. Sometimes it does; sometimes it

does not. When the hotel is a small and inexpensive arrangement in

Switzerland, where the advertised view of the Alpenglühen is

obtained by placing the chairs in a sociable circle on the sidewalk,

then usually it does. When the hotel is a large and expensive affair

in gayest Cairo, where the sunny and shady side rub elbows, and

gamesters and débutantes and touts and school teachers and vivid

ladies of conspicuous pasts and stout gentlemen of exhilarated

presents abound, in fact where innocent sightseers and initiated

traffickers in human frailties are often indistinguishable, then

decidedly it does not.


But fate, still smiling, dropped a silver shawl in Billy's path as

he was trailing his prey through the lounge after dinner. The shawl

belonged, most palpably, to a German lady three feet ahead of him,

but gripping it triumphantly, he bounded over the six feet which

separated him from the Eversham-Beecher triangle and with marvelous

self-restraint he touched Miss Eversham on the arm.


"You dropped this?" he inquired.


Miss Eversham looked surprisedly at Billy and uncertainly at the

shawl, which she mechanically accepted. "Why I—I didn't remember

having it with me," she hesitated.


"I noticed you were wearing one other evenings," said Billy, the

Artful, "so I thought——"


"You know whether this is yours or not, don't you, Clara?"

interposed the mother.


"They all look alike," murmured Clara Eversham, eying helplessly the

silver border.


Billy permitted himself to look at Miss Beecher. That young person

was looking at him and there was a disconcerting gaiety in her

expression, but at sight of him she turned her head, faintly

coloring. He judged she recalled his unmannerly eavesdropping that

afternoon.


"Pardon—excuse me—but that is to me belonging," panted an agitated

but firm voice behind them, and two stout and beringed hands seized

upon the glittering shawl in Miss Eversham's lax grasp. "It but just

now off me falls," and the German lady looked belligerent accusation

upon the defrauding Billy.


There was a round of apologetic murmurs, unacknowledged by the

recipient, who plunged away with her shawl, as if fearing further

designs upon it. Billy laughed down at the Evershams.


"I feel like a porch climber making off with her belongings. But I

had seen you with——"


"I do think I had mine this evening, after all," murmured Clara,

with a questioning glance after the departing one.


"An uncultured person!" stated Mrs. Eversham.


Miss Beecher said nothing at all. Her faint smile was mockingly

derisive.


"Anyway you must let me get you some coffee," Billy most

inconsequentially suggested, beckoning to the red-girdled Mohammed

with his laden tray, and because he was young and nice looking and

evidently a gentleman from their part of the world and his evening

clothes fitted perfectly and had just the right amount of braid,

Mrs. Eversham made no objection to the circle of chairs he hastily

collected about a taborette, and let him hand them their coffee and

send Mohammed for the cream which Miss Eversham declared was

indispensable for her health.


"If I take it clear I find it keeps me awake," she confided, and

Billy deplored that startling and lamentable circumstance, and

passed Mrs. Eversham the sugar and wondered if they could be the

Philadelphia Evershams of whom he had heard his mother speak, and

regretted that they were not, for then they would know who he

was—William B. Hill of Alatoona, New York. He found it rather

stupid traveling alone. Of course one met many Americans, but——


Mrs. Eversham took up that "but" most eagerly, and recounted

multiple and deplorable instances of nasal countrywomen doing the

East and monopolizing the window seats in compartments, and Miss

Eversham supplied details and corrections.


Still Miss Beecher said nothing. She had a dreamy air of not

belonging to the conversationalists. But from an inscrutable

something in her appearance, Billy judged she was not unentertained

by his sufferings.


At the first pause he addressed her directly. "And how do you like

Cairo?" was his simple question. That ought, he reflected, to be an

entering wedge.


The young lady did not trouble to raise her eyes. "Oh, very much,"

said she negligently, sipping her coffee.


"Oh, very well!" said Billy haughtily to himself. If being her

fellow countryman in a strange land, and obviously a young and

cultivated countryman whom it would be a profit and pleasure for any

girl to know, wasn't enough for her—what was the use? He ought to

get up and go away. He intended to get up and go away—immediately.


But he didn't. Perhaps it was the shimmery gold hair, perhaps it was

the flickering mischief of the downcast lashes, perhaps it was the

loveliness of the soft, white throat and slenderly rounded arms.

Anyway he stayed. And when the strain of waltz music sounded through

the chatter of voices about them and young couples began to stroll

to the long parlors, Billy jumped to his feet with a devastating

desire that totally ignored the interminable wanderings of Clara

Eversham's complaints.


"Will you dance this with me?" he besought of Miss Arlee Beecher,

with a direct gaze more boyishly eager than he knew.


For an agonizing moment she hesitated. Then, "I think I will," she

concluded, with sudden roguery in her smile.


Stammering a farewell to the Evershams, he bore her off.


It would be useless to describe that waltz. It was one of the

ecstatic moments which Young Joy sometimes tosses from her garlanded

arms. It was one of the sudden, vivid, unforgettable delights which

makes youth a fever and a desire. For Billy it was the wildest stab

the sex had ever dealt him. For though this was perhaps the nine

thousand nine hundred and ninety-ninth girl with whom he had danced,

it was as if he had discovered music and motion and girls for the

first time.


The music left them by the windows.


"Thank you," said Billy under his breath.


"You didn't deserve it," said the girl, with a faint smile playing

about the corners of her lips. "You know you stared—scandalously."


Grateful that she mentioned only the lesser sin, "Could I help it?"

he stammered, by way of a finished retort.


The smile deepened, "And I'm afraid you listened!"


He stared down at her anxiously. "Will you like me better if I

didn't?" he inquired.


"I shan't like you at all if you did."


"Then I didn't hear a word.... Besides," he basely uttered, "you

were entirely in the right!"


"I should think I was!" said Arlee Beecher very indignantly. "The

very notion—! Captain Kerissen is a very nice young man. He is

going to get me an invitation to the Khedive's ball."


"Is that a very crumby affair?"


"Crumby? It's simply gorgeous! Everyone is mad over it. Most

tourists simply read about it, and it is too perfect luck to be

invited! Only the English who have been presented at court are

invited and there's a girl at the Savoy Hotel I've met—Lady Claire

Montfort—who wasn't presented because she was in mourning for her

grandmother last year, and she is simply furious about it. An old

dowager here said that there ought to be similar distinctions among

the Americans—that only those who had been presented at the White

House ought to be recognized. Fancy making the White House a social

distinction!" laughed the daughter of the Great Republic.


"I wonder," said Billy, "if I met a nice Turkish lady, whether she

would get me an invitation? Then we could have another waltz——"


"There aren't any Turkish ladies there," uttered Miss Beecher

rebukingly. "Don't you know that? When they are on the

Continent—those that are ever taken there—they may go to dances

and things, but here they can't, although some of them are just as

modern as you or I, I've heard, and lots more educated."


"You speak," he protested, "from a superficial acquaintance with my

academic accomplishments."


"Are you so very—proficient?"


"I was—I am Phi Beta Kappa," he sadly confessed.


Her laugh rippled out. "You don't look it," she cheered.


"Oh, no, I don't look it," he complacently agreed. "That's the lamp

in the gloom. But I am. I couldn't help it. I was curious about

things and I studied about them and faculties pressed honors upon

me. I am even here upon a semi-learned errand. I wanted to have a

look at the diggings a friend of mine is making at Thebes and

several looks at the dam at Assouan, for I am by way of being an

engineer myself—a beginning engineer."


"You have been up the Nile, then?"


"Yes, I'm just back. Now I'm going to see something of Cairo before

I leave."


"We start up the Nile day after to-morrow," said she.


"The day after—" he stopped.


'Twas ever thus. Fate never did one good turn but she sneaked back

and jabbed him unawares. She was a tricksy jade.


"That's—that's gloomy luck," said Billy, and felt outraged. "Why,

how about that Khedive ball thing?"


"Oh, that's when we come back."


She was coming back, then. Hope lifted her head.


"When will that be?"


"In three weeks. It takes about three weeks to go up to the first

cataract and back, doesn't it?"


"Yes, by boat," he said, adding hopefully, "but lots of people like

the express trains better. They—they don't keep you so long on the

way."


"Oh, I hate trains," said she cheerfully.


Three weeks ... Ruefully he surveyed the desolation. "I ought to be

gone by then," he muttered.


A trifle startled, the girl looked up at him. As he was not looking

at her, but staring moodily into what was then black vacancy, her

look lingered and deepened. She saw a most bronzed and hardy looking

young man, tall and broad-shouldered, with gray eyes, wide apart

under straight black brows, and black hair brushed straight back

from a wide forehead. She saw a rugged nose, a likeable mouth, and

an abrupt and aggressive chin, saved somehow from grimness by a deep

cleft in the blunt end of it.... She thought he was a very

stirring looking young man. Undoubtedly he was a very sudden

young man—if he meant one bit of what he intimated.


Feminine-wise, she mocked.


"What a calamity!"


"Yes, for me," said Billy squarely. "You know it's—it's awfully

jolly to meet a girl from home out here!"


"A girl from home——!"


"Well, all America seems home from this place. And I shouldn't be

surprised if we knew a lot of the same people ... You can get a good

line on me that way, you know," he laughed. "Now I went to Williams

and then to Boston Tech., and there must be acquaintances——"


"Don't!" said Arlee, with a laughing gesture of prohibition. "We

probably have thousands of the same acquaintances, and you would

turn out to be some one I knew everything about—perhaps the first

fiancé of my roommate whose letters I used to help her answer."


"Where did you go to school?"


"At Elm Court School, near New York. For just a year."


He shook his head with an air of relief. "Never was engaged to

anybody's roommate there.... But if you'd rather not have my

background painted——"


"Much rather not," said the girl gaily. "Why, half the romance, I

mean the fun, of meeting people abroad is not knowing anything

about them beforehand."


The music was beginning again. Unwillingly the remembrance of the

outer world beat back into Billy's mind. Unhappily he became aware

that the room appeared blackened with young men in evening clothes,

staring ominously his way.


Squarely he stood in front of the girl. "I think this is the encore

to our dance," he told her with a little smile.


She shook her pretty head laughingly at him—and then yielded to his

clasping hands. "But we must dance back to the Evershams," she

demurred. "It is time for us to go to our concert."


But Billy had no intention of relinquishing her before the music

ceased. It was a one step, and it carried them with it in a gaiety

of rhythm to which the girl gave herself with the light-hearted

abandon of a romping child. Her light feet seemed scarcely to brush

the floor; the delicate flush of her cheeks deepened with the

stirring blood; her lips parted breathlessly over white little

teeth, and when her eyes, intensely blue, met Billy's, the smile in

them quickened in sparkling radiance. She was the very spirit of the

dance; she was Youth and Joy incarnate. And the heart behind the

white shirt bosom near which her fairy hair was floating began to

pitch and toss like a laboring ship in the very devil of a sea.


"I think I'll go up the Nile again," said Billy irrelevantly.


She laughed elfishly at him, her head swaying faintly with the

rhythm.


"Three weeks," said Billy under his breath, "that's twenty-one

days—at ten dollars a day. Now I wonder how many hours—or

moments—that rash outlay would assure?"


"You miser! You calculating——"


"You have to calculate—when you're an engineer."


"But to be sure spoils the charm! Now I—I do things on impulse."


"If you will only have the impulse to dance with me—on the

Nile——"


"Why not risk it?" she challenged lightly, arrant mischief in her

eyes. She added, in mocking tone, "There's a moon."


"That's a clincher," said he, with an air of decision. A faint

question dwelt in the look she gave him. It was ridiculous to think

he meant anything he was saying, but—she felt suddenly a little

confused and shy under that light-hearted young gaiety which took

every man's friendly admiration happily for granted.


In silence they finished the dance, and this time the music failed

them when they were near the wide entrance to the room where the

Evershams, beckoning specters, were standing.


"I'm keeping them waiting," said the girl, with a note of concern

which she had not shown over her performance in that line earlier in

the day. But Billy had no time for humorous comparisons.


"When can I see you again?" he demanded bluntly. "Can I see you

to-morrow?"


"To-morrow is a very busy day," she parried.


"But the evening——?"


"I shall be here," she admitted.


"And could I—could I take you—and the Evershams, of

course—somewhere, anywhere, you'd like to go? If there's any other

concert——"


She shook her head. "We leave bright and early the next morning, and

I know Mrs. Eversham will want her rest. I think they would rather

stay here in the hotel after dinner."


"But you will keep a little time for me?" Billy urged. "Of course,

staying in the same hotel, I can't take my hat and go and make a

formal call on you—but that's the result I'm after."


They had paused, to finish this colloquy, a few feet away from the

ladies, who were regarding with dark suspicion this interchange of

lowered tones.


Suddenly Arlee raised her eyes and gave Billy a quick look,

questioning, shyly serious.


"I shall be here—and you can call on me," she promised, and bade

him farewell.


She left him deliriously, inexplicably, foolishly in spirits. He

plunged his hands in his pockets and squared his shoulders; he

wanted to whistle, he wanted to sing, he wanted to do anything to

vent the singular hilarity which possessed him.


Then he saw, across the room, a sandy-haired young man regarding him

with dour intentness, and the spectacle, instead of feeding his joy,

sent conjecturing chills down his spine. His bubble was pricked.

Suppose, ran the horrid thought, suppose she was simply paying off

the Englishman? Girls, even blue-eyed, angel-haired girls of

cherubic aspect, have not been unknown to perform such deeds of

darkness! And this particular girl had mischief in her eyes.... The

thought was unpleasantly likely. What had he, Billy B. Hill, of New

York—State—to offer to casual view worthy of competition with the

presumable advantages of a young Englishman whose sister was staying

with a Lady Claire? Perhaps the fellow himself had a title....


Considerably dashed, he went out to consult the register upon that

point.


    CHAPTER II


    THE CAPTAIN CALLS


Now, when the card of Captain Kerissen was handed to Miss Arlee

Beecher the next afternoon, when she sauntered in from the sunny

out-of-doors and paused at the desk for the voluminous harvest of

letters the last mail had brought, and furthermore the information

was added that the Captain was waiting, little Miss Beecher's first

thought was the resentful appreciation that the Captain was

overdoing it.


She hesitated, then, with her hands full of letters and parasol, she

crossed the hall into the reception room. She intended to let her

caller see his mistake, so with her burdened hands avoiding a

handclasp, she greeted him and stood waiting, with eyes of inquiry

upon him.


The young man smiled secretly to himself. He was a young man not

without experience in ladies' moods and he had a very shrewd idea

that somebody had been making remarks, but he did not permit a hint

of any perception of the coolness of her manner to impair the

impeccable suavity of his.


"Will you accord me two moments of your time that I may give you

two messages?" he inquired, and Arlee felt suddenly ill-bred before

his gentle courtesy and she sat down abruptly upon the edge of the

nearest chair.


The Captain placed one near her and seated himself, with a clank of

his dangling scabbard. He was really a very handsome young man,

though his features were too finely finished to please a robust

taste, and there was a hint of insolence and cruelty about the nose

and mouth—though this an inexperienced and light-hearted young

tourist of one and twenty did not more than vaguely perceive.


"They are, the both, of the ball of the Khedive," he continued in

his English, which was, though amazingly fluent and ready, a literal

sounding translation of the French, which was in reality his mother

tongue. "My sister thinks she can arrange that invitation. You are

sure that you will be returned at Cairo, then?"


"Oh, dear, yes! I would come back by train," Arlee declared eagerly,

"rather than miss that wonderful ball!"


She thought how astonished a certain red-headed young Englishman

would be to see her at that ball, and how fortunate she was compared

to his haughty and disappointed friend, the Lady Claire, and the

chill of her resentment against the Captain's intrusion vanished

like snow in the warmth of her gratitude.


"Good!" He smiled at her with a flash of white teeth. "Then my

sister herself will see one of the household of the Khedive and

request the invitation for you and for your chaperon, the

Madame——"


"Eversham."


"Eversham. She will be included for you, but not the daughter—no?"


"Is that asking too much?" said Arlee hesitantly. "Miss Eversham

would feel badly to be left out.... But, anyway, I'm not sure that I

shall be with them then," she reflected.


"Not with them?" The young man leaned forward, his eyes curiously

intent upon her.


"No, I may be with some other friends. You see, it's this way—I

didn't come abroad with the Evershams in the first place. I came in

the fall with a school friend and her mother to see Italy. The

Evershams were friends of theirs and were stopping at the same

hotel, and since my friends were called back very suddenly, the

Evershams asked me to go on to Egypt with them. It was very nice of

them, for I'm a dreadful bother," said Arlee, dimpling.


"But you speak of leaving them?" he said.


"Oh, yes, I may do that as soon as some other friends of mine, the

Maynards, reach here. They are coming here on their way to the Holy

Land and I want to take that trip with them. And then I'll probably

go back to America with them."


The Turkish captain stared at her, his dark eyes rather inscrutable,

though a certain wonder was permitted to be felt in them.


"You American girls—your ways are absolute like the decrees of

Allah!" he laughed softly. "But tell me—what will your father and

your mother say to this so rapidly changing from the one chaperon to

the other?"


"I haven't any father or mother," said the girl. "I have a big,

grown-up, married brother, and he knows I wouldn't change from one

party unless it was all right." She laughed amusedly at the young

man's comic gesture of bewilderment. "You think we American girls

are terribly independent."


"I do, indeed," he avowed, "but," and he inclined his dark head in

graceful gallantry, "it is the independence of the princess of the

blood royal."


A really nice way of putting it, Arlee thought, contrasting the

chivalrous homage of this Oriental with the dreadful "American

goose!" of the Anglo-Saxon.


"But tell me," he went on, studying her face with an oddly intent

look, "do these friends now, the Evershams, know these others,

the—the——"


"Maynards," she supplied. "Oh, no, they have never met each other.

The Maynards are friends I made at school. And Brother has never met

them either," she added, enjoying his humorous mystification.


"The decrees of Allah!" he murmured again. "But I will promise you

an invitation for your chaperon and arrange for the name of the lady

later—n'est-ce-pas?"


"Yes, I will know as soon as I return from the Nile. You are going

to a lot of bother, you and your sister," declared Arlee gratefully.


"I go to ask you to take a little trouble, then, for that sister,"

said the Captain slowly. "She is a widow and alone. Her life is—is

triste—melancholy is your English word. Not much of brightness,

of new things, of what you call pleasure, enters into that life, and

she enjoys to meet foreign ladies who are not—what shall I

say?—seekers after curiosities, who think our ladies are strange

sights behind the bars. You know that the Europeans come uninvited

to our wedding receptions and make the strange questions!"


Arlee had the grace to blush, remembering her own avid desire to

make her way into one of those receptions, where the doors of the

Moslem harem are thrown open to the feminine world in widespread

hospitality.


The Captain went on, slowly, his eyes upon her, "But she knows that

you are not one of those others and has requested that you do her

the grace to call upon her. I assured her that you would, for I know

that you are kind, and also," with an air of naïve pride which Arlee

found admirable in him, "it is not all the world who is invited to

the home of our—our haut-monde, you understand?... And then it

will interest you to see how our ladies live in that seclusion which

is so droll to you. Confess you have heard strange stories," and he

smiled in quizzical raillery upon her.


The girl's flush deepened with the memory of the confusing stories

her head was stuffed with; tales of the bloomers, the veils, the

cushions, the sweetmeats, the nargueils, the rose baths of the old

régime were jostled by the stories of the French nurses and

English governesses and the Paris fashions of the new era. She had

listened breathlessly, with her eager young zest in life, to the

amazing and contradictory narrations of the tourists who were every

whit as ignorant as she was, and her curiosity was on fire to see

for herself. She felt that a chance in a thousand had come her lucky

way.


"I shall be very glad to call," she told him, "just as soon as I

return from the Nile."


His face showed his disappointment—and a certain surprise. "But not

before?"


"Why, I go to-morrow morning, you know," said Arlee. "And——"


"It would be better—because of the invitation," he said slowly,

hesitantly, with the air of one who does not wish to importune. "My

sister would like to ask for one who is known personally to herself.

She thought you could render her a few minutes this afternoon."


"This afternoon?" Arlee thought quickly. "I ought to be packing,"

she murmured, "my things aren't all ready.... And Mrs. Eversham is

at the bazaars again and dear knows when she will be back."


Just for an instant a spark burned in the black eyes watching the

girl, and then was gone, and when she raised her own eyes, perplexed

and considering, to him, she saw only the same courteously

attentive, but faintly indolent regard as before. Then the young man

smiled, with an air of frank amusement.


"That would seem to be a dispensation!" he laughed. "My sister and

the Madame Eversham—no, they would not be sympathetic!... But if

you can come," he went on quickly, leaning forward and speaking in a

hurried, lowered tone, "it can be arranged in an instant. I am to

telephone to my sister and she will send her car for you. It is not

far and it does not need but a few minutes for the visit—unless you

desire. I cannot escort you in the car—it is not en règle—but I

will come to the house and present you and then depart, that you

ladies may exchange the confidences.... Does that programme please

you?"


"I—I don't know your sister's name," said Arlee.


He smiled. "Nechedil Azade Seniha—she is the widow of Tewfik Pasha.

But say Madame simply to her—that will suffice. Shall I, then,

telephone her?"


Just an instant Arlee hesitated, while her imagination fluttered

about the thought like humming-birds about sweets. Already she was

thinking of the story she could have to tell to her fellow travelers

here and to the people at home. It was a chance, she repeated to

herself, in a thousand, and the familiar details of phones and

motors seemed to rob its suddenness of all strangeness.... Besides,

there was that matter of the Khedive's ball. It would be very

ungracious to refuse a few minutes' visit to a lady who was going to

so much trouble for her.


"I will be ready in ten minutes," she promised, springing to her

feet.


The forgotten letters scattered like a fall of snow and the Captain

stooped quickly for them, hiding the flash of exultation in his

face. He thrust the letters rather hurriedly upon her.


"Good!... But need you wait for a toilette when you are so—so

ravissante now?"


He gazed with frank appreciation at the linen suit she was wearing,

but she shook her head laughingly at him. "To be interesting to a

foreign lady I must have interesting clothes," she avowed. "I shan't

be ten minutes—really."


"Then the car will be in waiting. I will give your name to the

chauffeur and he will approach you." He thought a minute, and then

said, quickly, "And I will leave a note for Madame Eversham at the

desk to inform her of your destination and to express my regret that

she is not here to accept the invitation." His voice was flavored

with droll irony. "In ten minutes—bien sûr?"


She confirmed it most positively, and it really was not quite

eighteen when she stepped out on the veranda, a vision, a positively

devastating vision in soft and filmy white, with a soft and filmy

hat all white lace and a pink rose. It is to be hoped that she did

not know how she looked. Otherwise there would have been no excuse

for her and she should have been summarily haled to the nearest

justice, with all other breakers of the peace, and condemned to good

conduct and Shaker bonnets for the rest of her life. The rose on the

hat, with such a rose of a face beneath the hat, was sheer wanton

cruelty to mankind.


It brought the heart into the throat of one young man who was

reading his paper beneath the striped awning, when he was not

watching, cat-like, the streets and the hotel door. He dropped the

paper with an agitated rustle and half rose to his feet; his eyes,

alert and humorous gray-blue eyes, lighted with eagerness. His hand

flew up to his hat.


He did not need to take it off. She did not even see him. She was

hurrying forward to the steps, following a long, lean Arab, some

dragoman, apparently, in resplendent pongee robes, who opened the

door of a limousine for her. The next instant he slammed the door

upon her, mounted the front seat, and the car rolled away.


    CHAPTER III


    AT THE PALACE


That limousine utterly routed the tiny little qualm which had been

furtively worming into Arlee's thrill of adventure. Nothing very

strange or out-of-the-way, she thought, could be connected with such

a modern car; it presented every symptom of effete civilization.

Against the upholstery of delicate gray flamed the scarlet

poinsettias hanging in wall vases of crystal overlaid with silver

tracery; the mirror which confronted her was framed in silver, and

beneath it a tiny cabinet revealed a frivolous store of powders and

pins and scents. Decidedly the Oriental widow of said sequestration

had a car very much up to times. The only difference which it

presented from the cars of any modern city or of any modern lady was

in the smallness of the window panes, whose contracted size

confirmed the stories of the restrictions which Arlee had been told

were imposed upon Moslem ladies by even those emancipated masculine

relatives who conceded cars.


She peered out of the diminutive windows at the throng of life in

the unquiet streets as they halted for the passing of a camel laden

with bricks and stones from a demolished building; the poor thing

teetered precariously past under such a back-breaking load that the

girl felt it would have been a mercy to add the last straw and be

done with it. After it bobbed what was apparently an animated load

of hay, so completely were this other camel's legs hidden by his

smothering burden.


Then the car shot impatiently forward, passing a dog cart full of

fair-haired English children, the youngest clasped in the arms of a

dark-skinned nurse, and behind the cart ran an indefatigable sais,

bare-legged and sinewy, his red headdress and gold-embroidered

jacket and blue bloomers flashing in the sun. On the sidewalk a

party of American tourists were capitulating to a post-card vender,

and ahead of them a victoria load of German sightseers careened

around the corner in the charge of a determined dragoman.


Arlee smiled in happy superiority over these mere outsiders. She

was not going about the beaten track, peeping at mosques and tombs

and bazaars and windows; she was penetrating into the real life of

this fascinating city, getting behind the grills and veils to

glimpse the inner secrets.


She thought, with a deepening of the sparkle in her blue eyes and a

defiant lifting of the pointed chin, of a certain sandy-haired young

Englishman and how wrong and reasonless and narrow and jealous were

his strictures upon her politeness to young Turks, and she thought

with a sense of vindicated pride of how thoroughly that nice young

man who had managed to introduce himself last night had endorsed her

views. Americans understood. And then her thoughts lingered about

Billy and she caught herself wondering just how much he did mean

about coming up the Nile again. For upon happening to meet Billy

that morning—Billy had devoted two hours and a half to the accident

of that happening!—he had joyously mentioned that he was trying to

buy out another man's berth upon that boat. It wasn't so much his

wanting to come that was droll—teasing sprites of girls with

peach-blossom prettiness are not unwonted to the thunder of pursuing

feet—but the frank and cheery way he had of announcing it. Not many

men had the courage of their desires. Not any men that little Miss

Arlee had yet met had the frankness of such courage. And because all

women love the adventurous spirit and are woefully disappointed in

its masculine manifestations, she felt a gay little eagerness which

she would have refused to own. It would be rather fun to see more of

him—on the Nile—while Robert Falconer was sulking away in Cairo.

And then when she returned she would surprise and confound that

misguided young Englishman with her unexpected—to him—presence at

the Khedive's ball. And after that—but her thoughts were lost in

haziness then. Only the ball stood out distinct and glittering and

fairylike.


Thinking all these brightly revengeful thoughts she had been

oblivious to the many turnings of the motor, though it had occurred

to her that they were taking more time than the car had needed to

appear, and now she looked out the window and saw that they were in

a narrow street lined with narrow houses, whose upper stories,

slightly projecting in little bays, all presented the elaborately

grilled façades of mashrubiyeh work which announced the barred

quarters of the women, the haremlik.


Arlee loved to conjure up a romantic thrill for the mysterious East

by reflecting that behind these obscuring screens were women of all

ages and conditions, neglected wives and youthful favorites, eager

girls and revolting brides, whose myriad eyes, bright or dull or gay

or bitter, were peering into the tiny, cleverly arranged mirrors

which gave them a tilted view of the streets. It was the sense of

these watching eyes, these hidden women, which made those screened

windows so stirring to her young imagination.


The motor whirled out of the narrow street and into one that was

much wider and lined by houses that were detached and separated,

apparently, by gardens, for there was a frequent waving of palms

over the high walls which lined the road. The street was empty of

all except an old orange vender, shuffling slowly along, with a

cartwheel of a tray on her head, piled with yellow fruit shining

vividly in the hot sun. The quiet and the solitude gave a sense of

distance from the teeming bazaars and tourist-ridden haunts, which

breathed of seclusion and aloofness.


The car stopped and Arlee stepped out before a great house of

ancient stone which rose sharply from the street. A high, pointed

doorway, elaborately carved, was before her, arching over a dark

wooden door heavily studded with nails. Overhead jutted the little

balconies of mashrubiyeh. She had no more than a swift impression

of the old façade, for immediately a doorkeeper, very vivid in his

Oriental blue robes and his English yellow leather Oxfords, flung

open the heavy door.


Stepping across the threshold, with a sudden excited quickening of

the senses, in which so many things were mingled that the misgiving

there had scarcely time to make itself felt, Arlee found herself in

a spacious vestibule, marble floored and inlaid with brilliant tile.

She had just a glimpse of an inner court between the high arches

opposite, and then her attention was claimed by Captain Kerissen,

who sprang forward with a flash of welcome in his eyes that was like

a leap of palpable light.


"You are come!" he said, in a voice which was that of a man almost

incredulous of his good fortune. Then he bowed very formally in his

best military fashion, straight-backed from the waist, heels stiffly

together. "I welcome you," he said. "My sister is rejoiced.... This

stair—if you please."


He waved to a stairway on the left, a small, steep affair, which

Arlee ascended slowly, a sense of strangeness mounting with her, in

spite of her confident bearing. She had not realized how odd it

would feel to be in this foreign house with the Captain at her

heels.


There was a door at the top of the stairs standing open into a long,

spacious room which seemed shrouded in twilight after the sunflooded

court. One entire side of the room was a brown, lace-like screen of

mashrubiyeh windows; wide divans stretched beside them, and at the

end of the room, facing Arlee, was a throne-like chair raised on a

small dais and canopied with heavy silks.


By one of the windows a woman was squatting, a short, stout,

turbaned figure, striking a few notes on a tambourine and crooning

softly to herself in a low guttural. She raised her head without

rising, to look at the entering couple, and for a startled second

Arlee had the half hysterical fear that this squatting soloist was

the triste and aristocratic representative of the haut-monde of

Moslem which the Captain had brought her to see, but the next

instant another figure appeared in a doorway and came slowly toward

them.


Flying to the winds went Arlee's anticipations of somber elegance.

She saw the most amazingly vivid creature that she had ever laid

eyes on—a woman, young, though not in her first youth, penciled,

powdered, painted, her hair a brilliant red, her gown a brilliant

green. After the first shock of scattering amazement, Arlee became

intensely aware of a pair of yellow-brown eyes confronting her with

a faintly smiling and rather mocking interrogation. The dark of

kohl about the eyes emphasized a certain slant diablérie of line

and a faint penciling connected with the high and supercilious arch

of the brows. Henna flamed on the pointed tips of the fingers

blazoned with glittering rings, and Arlee fancied the brilliance of

the hair was due to this same generous assistance of nature.


"My soul!" thought the girl swiftly, "they do get themselves up!"


The Captain had stepped forward, speaking quickly in Turkish, with a

hard-sounding rattle of words. The sister glanced at him with a

deepening of that curious air of mockery and let fall two words in

the same tongue. Then she turned to Arlee.


"Je suis enchantée—d'avoir cet honneur—cet honneur

inattendu——"


She did not look remarkably enchanted, however. The eyes that played

appraisingly over her pretty caller had a quality of curious

hardness, of race hostility, perhaps, the antagonism of the East for

the West, the Old for the New. Not all the modernity of clothes, of

manners, of language, affected what Arlee felt intensely as the

strange, vivid foreignness of her.


"My sister does not speak English—she has not the occasion," the

Captain was quickly explaining.


"Gracious" thought Arlee, in dismay. She had no illusions about

her French; it did very well in a shop or a restaurant, but it was

apt to peeter out feebly in polite conversation. Certainly it was no

vessel for voyaging in untried seas. There were simply loads of

things, she thought discouragedly, the things she wanted most to

ask, that she would not be able to find words for.


Aloud she was saying, "I am so glad to have the honor of being here.

I am only sorry that my French is so bad. But perhaps you can

understand——"


"I understand," assented the Turkish woman, faintly smiling.


The Captain had brought forward little gilt chairs of a French

design which seemed oddly out of place in this room of the East, and

the three seated themselves. Out of place, too, seemed the grand

piano which Arlee's eyes, roving now past her hostess, discovered

for the first time.


"It was so kind of you," began Arlee again as the silence seemed to

be politely waiting upon her, "to send your automobile for me."


"Ah—my automobile!" echoed the woman on a higher note, and laughed,

with a flash of white teeth between carmined lips. "It pleased you?"


"Oh, yes, it is splendid!" the girl declared, in sincere praise. "It

is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen."


"I enjoy it very much—that automobile!" said the other, again

laughing, with a quick turn of her eyes toward the brother.


Negligently, rather caressingly, the young man murmured a few

Turkish words. She shrugged and leaned back in her chair, the flash

of animation gone. "And Cairo—that pleases you?" she asked of

Arlee.


Stumbling a little in her French, but resolutely rushing over the

difficulties, Arlee launched into the expression of how very much it

pleased her. Everything was beautiful to her. The color, the sky,

the mosques, the minarets, the Nile, the pyramids—they were all

wonderful. And the view from the Great Pyramid—and then she

stopped, wondering if that were not beyond her hostess's experience.


In confirmation of the thought the Turkish lady smiled, with an

effect of disdain. "Ascend the pyramids—that is indeed too much for

us," she said. "But nothing is too much for you Americans—no?"


Her curious glance traveled slowly from Arlee's flushed and lovely

face, under the rose-crowned hat, down over the filmy white gown and

white-gloved hands clasping an ivory card case, to the small,

white-shod feet and silken ankles. Arlee did not resent the

deliberate scrutiny; in coming to gaze she had been offering herself

to be gazed upon, and she was conscious that the three of them

presented a most piquant group in this dim and spacious old room of

the East—the modern American girl, the cosmopolitan young officer

in his vivid uniform, and this sequestered woman, of a period of

transition where the kohl and henna of the odalisque contrasted

with a coiffure and gown from Paris.


Slowly and disconnectedly the uninspiring conversation progressed.

Once, when it appeared halted forever, Arlee cast a helpless look at

the Captain and intercepted a sharp glance at his sister. Indeed,

Arlee thought, that sister was not distinguishing herself by her

grateful courtesy to this guest who was brightening the tristesse

of her secluded day, but perhaps this was due to her Oriental

languor or the limitations of their medium of speech.


It was a relief to have the Captain suggest music. At their polite

insistence Arlee went to the piano and did her best with a piece of

MacDowell. Then the sister took her turn, and to her surprise Arlee

found herself listening to an exquisite interpretation of some of

the most difficult of Brahms. The beringed and tinted fingers

touched the notes with rare delicacy, and brought from the piano a

quality so vivid and poignant in appeal that Arlee could dream that

here the player's very life and heart were finding their real

expression.


The last note fell softly into silence, and with her hands still on

the keys the woman looked up over her shoulder at her brother,

looked with an intentness oddly provocative and prolonged. And for

the first time Arlee caught the quality of sudden and unforeseen

attraction in her, and realized that this insolence of color, this

flaunting hair and painted mouth might have their place in some

scheme of allurement outside her own standards.... And then suddenly

she felt queerly sorry for her, touched by the quick jarring

bitterness of a chord the woman suddenly struck, drowning the

laughing words the Captain had murmured to her.... Arlee felt

vaguely indignant at him. No one wanted to have jokes tossed at her

when she had just poured her heart out in music.


The Captain was on his feet, making his adieux. Now that the ladies

were acquainted, he would leave them to discuss the modes and other

feminine interests. He wished Miss Beecher a delightful trip upon

the Nile and hoped to see her upon her return, and she could be sure

that everything would be arranged for her. When she had had her tea

and wished to leave, the motor would return her to the hotel. He

made a rapid speech in Turkish to his sister, bowed formally to

Arlee over a last au revoir and was gone.


Immediately the old woman entered with a tray of tea things, the

same old woman who had been squatting by the window, but who had

noiselessly left the room during the music. She was followed by a

bewitching little girl of about ten with another tray, who remained

to serve while the old woman shuffled slowly away. Arlee was struck

by the informality of the service; the servants appeared to be

underfoot like rugs; they came and went at will, unregarded.


The tea was most disappointingly ordinary, for the pat of butter

bore the rose stamp of the English dairy and the bread was English

bake, but the sweetmeats were deliciously novel, resembling nothing

Arlee had seen in the shops, and new, too, was the sip of syrup

which completed the refreshment.


Her hostess had said but little during the repast, remaining silent,

with an air of polite attention, her eyes fixed upon her caller with

a gaze the girl found bafflingly inscrutable. Now as the girl rose

to go, the Turkish woman suddenly revived her manners of hostess and

suggested a glimpse of some of the other rooms of the palace. "Our

seclusion interests you—yes?" she said, with a half-sad,

half-bitter smile on her scarlet lips, and Arlee was conscious of a

sense of apologetic intrusion battling with her lively curiosity as

she followed her down the long chamber and through a curtained

doorway to the right of the throne-like chair, into a large and

empty anteroom, where the sunlight streaming through the lightly

screened window on the wall at the right reminded Arlee that it was

yet glowing afternoon.


She lingered by the window an instant, looking down into the court

which she had glimpsed from the vestibule. Across the court she saw

a row of windows which, being unbarred, she guessed to be on the

men's side of the house, and to the left the court was ended by a

sort of roofed colonnade.


Her hostess passed under an elaborate archway, and Arlee followed

slowly, passing through one stately, high-ceiled, dusty room into

another, plunged again into the twilight of densely screening

mashrubiyeh. There were views of fine carving, painted ceilings,

inlaid door paneling, and rich and rusty embroideries where the name

of Allah could frequently be traced, but Arlee was ignorant of the

rare worth of all she saw; she stared about with no more than a

girl's romantic sense of the old-time grandeur and the Oriental

strangeness, mingled with a disappointment that it was all so empty

and devoid of life.


This part of the palace was very old, her hostess said

uninterestedly; these were the rooms of the dead and gone ladies of

the dead and gone years. One of the Mamelukes had first built this

wing for his favorite wife—she had been poisoned by her rival and

died, here, on that divan, the narrator indicated, with a negligent

gesture.


Wide-eyed, Arlee stared about the empty, darkened rooms and felt

dimly oppressed by them. They were so old, so melancholy, these

rooms of dead and gone ladies. How much of life had been lived here,

how much of hope had been smothered with these walls! What aching

love and fiery hate had vibrated here, only to smolder into helpless

ennui under the endless weight of tedious days.... She shivered

slightly, oppressed by the dreams of these ancient rooms, dreams

that were heavy with realities.


Slowly she moved back after her hostess, who had pushed back a

panel in one wall, and Arlee stepped beside her within the tiny,

balcony-like enclosure the panel had revealed, one side of which was

a wooden lace-work of fine screening, permitting one to see but not

be seen. Pressing her face against the grill, Arlee found she was

looking down into a long and spacious hall, lined with delicate

columns bearing beautiful, pointed arches, and brilliant with old

gilding and inlay.


This was the colonnade which she had seen forming one side of the

court; it was the hall of banquets, she was told, and connected this

wing of the palace, the haremlik, with the selamlik, the men's

wing, across the way. Here in old times the lord of the palace gave

his feasts, and this nook had been built for some favorite to view

the revels.


Arlee stared down into the great empty hall with an involuntary

quickening of the breath. How desolate it was, but how beautiful in

its desolation! What strange revels had taken place there to the

notes of wild music, what girls had danced, what voices had shouted,

what moods had been indulged! She thought of the men who had made

merry there ... and then she thought of the women, generations of

women, who had stood where she was standing, pressing their young

faces against the grill, their bright eyes peering, peering down.

She felt their soft little silken ghosts all about her, their

bangles clinking, their perfumes enveloping her sense—lovely little

painted dolls, their mimic passions helpless in their hearts....


Dreaming, she turned and in silence retraced her way after her

hostess, loitering by the window in the anteroom to watch a veiled

girl drawing water at the old well in the center, an old well rich

in arabesques.


How much happier, thought Arlee, were these serving maids in the

freedom of their poverty than the cloistered aristocrats behind

their darkened windows. She wondered if that strange figure beside

her, half Moslem, half modern, envied the little maid the saucy jest

which she flung at a bare-footed boy idling beside a dozing white

donkey. As she watched the old-world quiet of the picture was

broken. Some one, the doorkeeper, she thought, from his vivid robes

and yellow shoes, came running across the court, shouting something

at the girl which sent her flying to the house, her jar forgotten,

and another man, an enormous Nubian with blue Turkish bloomers,

short red jacket and a red fez, hurried across the court toward the

haremlik.


The lady stepped toward the screening and called down; the man

stopped, raised his head, and shouted back a jargon of excited

gutturals, waving his arms in vehement gesturing. His mistress

interrupted with a brief question, then with another, then nodding

her head indifferently to herself, she called down an order,

apparently, and turned away.


"One of our servants is dead," she murmured to Arlee in explanation.

"They say now it is the plague."


"The plague?" repeated the girl absently. She was thinking what a

hideous creature that great Nubian was. Then, more vividly, "The

plague?"


"You have fear?" said the negligent voice.


Arlee nodded frankly. "Oh, yes, I should be terribly afraid of it,"

she averred. "Aren't you?" And then she reflected, as she saw the

inscrutable smile playing about the older woman's lips, that she

must be witnessing that fatalistic apathy of the East that she had

read about.


But there was nothing apathetic about the Captain. He followed on

the very heels of the announcement, his sword clanking, his spurs

jingling, as he bounded up the stairs and hurried through the long,

dim drawing-room toward them.


"You have heard?" he cried in English as they came to meet him. "You

have heard?"


"Of the plague!" Arlee answered, wondering at his agitation. "Yes,

your sister just told me. Is it really the plague?"


"So say those damned doctors—pardon, but they are such imbeciles!"

He made an angry gesture with his clenched hand. His face was tense

and excited. "They say so. And there is another sick ... Dieu,

what a misfortune! Truly, there was illness about us, a little, but

who thought——"


"I shall run back to my hotel," said Arlee lightly, "before I catch

one of your germs."


"To the hotel—a thousand pardons, but that is the thing forbidden."

The young man made a gesture, with empty palms outspread, eloquent

of rebellion and despair. "Those doctors—those pig English—they

have set a quarantine upon us!"


    CHAPTER IV


    A SORRY GUEST


"A quarantine?" said Arlee Beecher, in a perfectly flat little

voice.


Again the young man exercised his power of gesture, his dark eyes

seeming to plead his own helpless desire to mitigate his words.


"Truly a quarantine. It is tyranny, but what can one do? They will

hear nothing—they set their guard and it is finished—bien

simple. We are their prisoners."


"Prisoners?" Her mind appeared but a hollow echo of his words. Her

heart was dropping, dropping sickishly, into unending space. Then

meaning stabbed her like a dentist's needle, and a pandemonium of

incredulity and revolt clamored through every nerve in her body.

"Why you can't mean—I'm going back to the hotel this instant! I

haven't seen your servant!"


"That is nothing to them. They have no reason—heads of pigs! No one

must leave or they shoot—the tyrants, the imbecile tyrants! But

their day will not be forever—Islam will not endure——"


It was of no moment to Arlee Beecher what Islam would not endure.

Her heart was galloping now like a runaway horse, but her voice rang

with quick reaction from that first sickening shock.


"What nonsense," she said positively. "They wouldn't shoot me. Why

didn't you call me when the English doctor was here. I could have

explained then. But now—now I had better telephone, I suppose.

Either to the doctor or the English ambassador—or the American

consul. I'll make them understand in a jiffy. Where is your

telephone, please?"


"Alas, not in the palace." The young captain's look of regret

deepened.


"But—but you telephoned your sister! You telephoned her this

afternoon."


"Ah, yes, but I spoke to a telephone which is in a palace near

here—the palace of my uncle. I sent a servant with the message. But

I can send a message to that palace," he offered eagerly, "and they

can telephone for you. Or I can send notes out to all the people you

wish. The soldiers will call boys to deliver them."


Across the girl's perfectly white face a tremor of panic darted;

then she bit her lips very hard and stared very intently past the

Captain's green and gold shoulder. She had totally forgotten the

sister who had sunk on a divan beside them, her brown eyes rimmed in

their dark pencilings turning from one to the other as if to read

their faces.


"I'll just speak to those soldiers, myself," said Arlee decidedly.

"I'll make them understand." She left them there, their eyes upon

her and sped down the long room to the door which the Captain's

hurried entrance had left half open. She disappeared down the steps.


In three minutes she was back, a flame in the frightened white of

her cheeks, a flame in the frightened blue of her eyes.


"Captain Kerissen," she called, and he took a step nearer to her,

his face alert with sympathy, "Captain Kerissen, that is a native

soldier! He is at the bottom of the stairs—with a bayonet—and he

will not let me pass. He doesn't know a word I say. Please come and

tell him."


"Miss Beecher, it is useless for me to tell him anything," said the

young Turk with a ring of quiet conviction. "I have been talking to

that one—and to the others. They are at every entrance. It is as I

told you—we are prisoners."


"Surely you can tell him that I am a guest—you can bribe him to

turn his head, to let me slip by——"


"He would be shot if he let you out that street door. He has his

orders to keep the ladies in their quarters and it is death to him

to disobey. That is the discipline—and the discipline has no

mercy—particularly upon the native soldiers." His tone held

bitterness. "It is useless to resist the soldiers. You must resign

yourself to remain a guest until I can obtain word to one who can

render assistance.... Will it be so hard?" he added sympathetically,

as she stood silent, her lips pressed quiveringly together. "My

sister will do everything——"


"Of course I can't stay here," broke in Arlee in her clear, positive

young tones. "I must get back to the Evershams—and we are going up

the Nile to-morrow morning. Can you get a message to that doctor at

once? And have someone go and telephone from the next house to the

consul and ambassador—and I'll write them notes, too."


Her voice broke suddenly. On what wings of folly she had come alone

to this place! Her bright adventure was a stupid scrape. Oh, what

mischance—what mischance! She was chokingly ashamed of the

predicament—to be penned up by a quarantine in a Moslem household.

She was angry, defiant and humiliated at once. What would the

Evershams say—and Robert Falconer——


She had never waited for anything as she waited for the answers to

the passionately urgent notes she sent out. She had written the

doctor, the ambassador, the consul, the Evershams. And then she

walked up and down, up and down that long, dim room which grew

darker and darker with the fading light and counted off the seconds

and the minutes and the hours with her pulsing heart beats. She had

never known there was such suspense in the world. It was comparable

to nothing in her girl's life—the only faint analogy was in the old

school-time when she thought she had failed in the history

examination and her roommate had gone to the office to find out for

her. She remembered walking the floor then, in a silly panic of

fear. But she had not failed—she had just squeaked through and it

would be like that now. Someone would come to tell her that

everything was all right and laugh with her at her foolish fright.

But underneath this strain of fervent reassurance ran a cold little

current like an underground brook, a seeping chill of dread and

vague fear and strange amazement that she should be here in this

lonely palace, peering out of darkened windows, waiting and

listening.


This time it was the Captain's steps, coming up the stairs.

Perceptive of her impatience, he had left her to herself, till he

could bring word. Now she stood, listening to the nearing jingle

that accompanied his footsteps, her hands clasped involuntarily

against her breast in rigid tension. And when she saw his face

through the dusk, saw the courteous deprecation of it, the

solicitous sympathy, she did not need his words to tell her that it

was not yet all right.


There was nothing to be done. Legal and medical authorities united

in insisting that no one, not even the guest, should leave the

palace until the fear of spreading the infection was past. This

might be modified in a day or two, but for the present they were too

frightened to make exceptions.


And they were going up the Nile Friday morning, Arlee remembered

numbly. And this was Thursday night.


"Did the Evershams—did they answer my letter?" she said with dry

lips.


The Evershams, it seemed, had not been at the hotel. Perhaps when

they had read the letter they would be able to do something about

it.


"They'll just talk!" cried Arlee passionately, her breast heaving.


She wanted to scream, she wanted to rave, she wanted to fly down

the stairs and hurl herself recklessly against that barring bayonet.

But because there was pride and spirit behind her delicate

loveliness she shut the door hard upon those imps of hysteria and

with high-held head and palely smiling lips she thanked the Captain

for the hospitality he was extending in his sister's name. Yes,

thank you, she would rejoin them at dinner. Yes, thank you, she

would like to go to her room now.


A serving maid, called by her hostess, conducted her—the blue-robed

girl, she thought, that she had seen drawing water at the well. A

black shawl hung from her head and dangling in its folds the

yashmak ready to be slipped on at the approach of the men before

whom she must appear veiled. Her bare feet were thrust into scarlet

slippers, and as she moved silver anklets were visible, hanging

loosely over slim, brown ankles. Shuffling slightly, yet with an

erectly graceful carriage, the girl led the way into the ante-room

again, pulled open one of the closed doors in the opposite wall and

passed up an encased staircase wrapped in darkness. They emerged

into the dusk of a long, dim hall, where hanging lamps from the

ceiling shed a mild luster and a strong smell of oil, and passing

one or two doors on the right, the maid pushed, open one that was

rich in old gilding.


Crossing the threshold Arlee felt that she was crossing the

centuries again into her own time.


The room was a glitter of white and rose; the windows, unscreened,

admitted the warm glow of late afternoon, and windows and doorway

and bed were smothered in rose and white hangings. A white

triple-mirrored dressing-table gleamed with gold and ivory pieces; a

white fur rug was stretched before a rose silk divan billowy with

plump pillows, and an open door beyond gave a view of shining tile

and a porcelain bath. Near her was a baby grand piano in white

enamel—reminding her of one she had seen in the White House—and

she noted absently a pile of gaudily covered music upon it betokening

tunes different from the Brahms she had heard downstairs.


The maid indicated a pitcher of hot water in the bathroom—evidently

pipes and faucets played no part with the shining tub—and then

stepped outside, closing the door.


After an instant's hesitation, Arlee took off her hat and bathed her

face and hands, then moved slowly to the dressing table to glance at

her hair. Hesitantly she picked up the shining brush and stared at

the flourish of an unintelligible monogram upon the back. Whose

brush was this? Whose room was she in? The place, vivid, silken,

scented, was fairly breathing with occupancy.


She laid down the brush without using it, touched her hair with

absent fingers, and crossed to the windows. She looked down into a

garden, a deep tangle of a garden, presided over by a huge lebbek

tree that threw a pall of shadow upon the faintly moving flowers

beneath.


The place seemed a riot in neglect, for across the white sanded

paths thick creepers had flung their arms, and vines and climbers

were scaling the gnarled limbs of the acacia trees and covering the

high walls beyond. She was looking to the west where the rose and

gold of sunset still hung breathless on the painted air, though the

sun was hidden below the fringe of palms which rose above the wall,

and for a moment that still brilliance of the sky above the sharply

silhouetted palms made her heart quicken in forgetfulness.


And then her hands became aware of the bars she had been

unconsciously clasping, white-painted bars extending across the

window. They were of iron.


Not even here was there freedom, she thought with a throb of dread,

not even here where one faced dark gardens and blank walls and the

empty west.


Somehow that dinner had passed, that queer dinner in the candle

light between the silent, painted woman and the politely talkative

young man, and passed without a word from outside for the girl whose

nerves were fraying with the suspense. The old woman and the little

girl had served them with a meal which would have been judged

delicious in any European hotel and though Arlee's nerves were

tricky her young appetite was not and she ate and talked with a

determined little air of trying to dissipate the strangeness of the

situation.


And with the coffee came inspiration. She began to plan ... half

listening to the Captain's amiable efforts to entertain her with an

account of the palace, and of its history under Ismail, the Mad

Khedive, who had occupied it for some months, tearing down and

building in his feverish way, only to weary at the first hint of

completion. She was wondering why in the world the inspiration had

not arrived at once. Perhaps something in this fatalistic air, this

stupid acceptance of authority had numbed her.


With alacrity she accepted the Captain's suggestion of a stroll in

the garden, and was relieved when the silent sister did not rise to

accompany them, but remained in the candle-light with her coffee and

cigarette. She found the woman's lightly mocking, watchful eyes, the

enigmatic smile upon the carmined lips, increasingly hard to bear.

That woman didn't like her—she had failed, somehow, to propitiate

her hostile curiosities.


Back through the old empty rooms of the past, the Captain led her,

and passing by the screened alcove from which Arlee had looked down

into the ancient banquet hall he came to a small dark painted door

which he unlocked. The door opened upon a flight of worn and narrow

stone steps descending into the garden.


It had been night in the palace of darkened windows but in the

garden it was yet day, although the rose and gold of sunset had

faded to paling pinks and translucent ambers and in the east the

stars were shining in the deepening blue. It was the same garden on

which her windows opened; Arlee recognized the huge lebbek tree in

the center, the row of acacias, and the palms against the farthest

wall. It was a very old garden. Those trees must have seen many,

many years, she thought, and felt again that sense of vague

oppression and melancholy which the lonely rooms of the palace had

given her; that row of acacias which cast such crooked shadows over

the path had been planted by very long-ago hands.


So she thought fleetingly, then stared about, her concern for other

things. Captain Kerissen lighted a cigarette; over his cupped hands

his eyes followed hers searchingly.


"That is the hall of banquets?" she said, pointing to the raised

colonnade.


"Ah, yes—you are quick to learn!" he complimented.


"And could we walk through that into the courtyard?"


"Undoubtedly."


"And this side is the haremlik," she murmured, glancing up at the

windows upon the third floor which she felt were those of that rose

and white room. Much of the rest of the wing, she saw, extending

down to the high wall at right angles to it, was in a ruinous and

dilapidated condition. "What is there?" she asked.


"The rooms the Khedive Ismail left unfinished. They are of no use."


"And on the other side?" she persisted, pointing towards the wall

that was the continuation of the men's wing, which stopped at the

colonnade.


"On the other side is the palace of another man, and on the other

side of that, ending the road is a cimitère—what you say,

cemetery."


"And back of that wall?" She nodded at the one behind the palms,

running parallel to the banquet hall.


"Back of that a canal, Mademoiselle, and across are other

palaces.... You study the geography, it appears?"


"Indeed I do!" She turned towards him, her face bright with

eagerness. Her light curls were blown about her forehead by a

breeze, hot and dry, that seemed to mingle the odors of the desert

with a piercing sweetness which it drew from the deep throats of the

lilies swaying beside the path. "And I think that is going to be

the way out for me." Her quick nod was for the wall behind the

palms. "I want you to do me a great big favor, Captain Kerissen,

that will make me your debtor for life! You must help me break out

of this quarantine this very night?"


Not the ghost of a fear of failure to persuade him lurked in those

bright, dancing eyes. Not the ghost of a fear of failure haunted

those confident, smiling lips.


He sucked on his cigarette a moment, then slowly blew a thin ring of

blue smoke. He appeared interested in watching it.


"What is it—this idea?" he murmured.


"Well, you may have a better one but mine is just to climb that

wall, as soon as it gets dark. If you just get a ladder, or a pile

of chairs I am sure I can manage it—and then I'll be back at the

hotel in an hour!"


He took out his cigarette and shook his head at her. "You would

drop, like the plum of Haydee, into the arms of the soldier who is

guarding on the other side.... Shall I tell you the story of that

plum?"


"A soldier guarding—a native soldier?"


"Yes."


"Then—then please won't you see if you can bribe him?" she

shamelessly pleaded, anxiously clasping and unclasping her hands.

"Please, Captain Kerissen, you must help me to run away to-night.

I can't be shut up like this—I can't give up the Nile trip and

besides—Oh, I really must be back at that hotel to-night!... If

that soldier is sure no one else will see him I know you can

persuade him to look away just a little minute while I slip down and

run off!"


"Ah, no, no, my dear Miss Beecher, there is no hope of that." The

young man started walking down the path and Arlee walked beside him,

her eyes fixed on his face, incredulous of the denial that they were

reading there. "He would think it a test, a trap—not for one minute

is it to be thought of! Now could I let you go alone in that place

by the canal. There is danger—you do not understand——"


"Oh, I understand, but I can take care of myself!" Across her

pleading flashed the ironic thought of how excellently she had taken

care of herself in coming there that very afternoon! "Just let me

get over that wall and I can find my way—and if you cannot bribe

the man we can wait till it is darker and then, when he is at the

other end, why I can be down and off in a jiffy!"


"He would shoot," said the Captain. "He has his order. I have talked

with them.... And what would the authorities say when they send here

the doctor to-morrow and you are gone?"


"Say—say—Oh, what does it matter what they say? Tell them that I

ran away without your knowledge. Surely——"


"But your name has been given as detained. They would not let you

reappear in the world——"


"You leave that to me! I know it would be all right—once I was

there. Please do this for me, Captain Kerissen—please! I know

that in a great palace like this there must be many, many ways where

one could slip into the streets——"


"In all this palace there are but three doors—the door in the

vestibule by which you entered, the great door to its right, under

the arch into the court, and the little door from the garden to the

canal." He waved his cigarette at the wall ahead of them, towards

which they were slowly walking. "And all those three doors are

barred upon the outside and there is a soldier before each one—and

the soldier that you saw within the vestibule, watching us there."


"But—but the windows." She remembered the mashrubiyeh, but went

on resolutely, "I mean, the windows on the men's side. Aren't there

any windows in that part which are open?"


"The selamlik is a short wing and looks into the court." A note of

impatience sounded in his voice. He tossed away his cigarette which

fell, a burning spark, in the shadows. Already, as they talked, it

had grown darker, and the impatient tropic night was stealing on

them. "It is no use," he repeated. "There is no way out for you—or

any of us."


Into her heart stole the unthinkable perception that he did not want

to help her—he was afraid of the authorities—or else—or

else—Desperately she returned to the appeal.


"But do let me try to get over that wall. I will watch for the

soldier—I will take the responsibility. Please, now—let us plan

that attempt."


His answer held a quiet finality. "It is impossible.... And the wall

is too high for such little feet."


The startled color flashed into her cheeks. Only Oriental language

of course.... Perhaps she was unduly sensitive to any hint of

familiarity in her predicament.


"I could manage it perfectly," she said with coldness.


He bent over her, as they walked. "Are you so unhappy here?"


"Of course I am unhappy," she gave back with a clear

matter-of-factness that strove to ignore the sudden softening of his

voice. "I am very unhappy. I realize that I should not be here,

that I am intruding upon your hospitality——"


"You are making me most happy."


"And I am making my friends most anxious and losing my trip on the

Nile."


"The Nile," he said, "flows on forever. Who knows how soon you will

see it and under what happier circumstances?"


"Our boat was to sail at ten. I simply must find a way out

to-night——"


"That is impossible." He spoke with sudden irritation, which he

softened the next instant, with a light laugh. "You Americans—how

you hurry!... Tell me—have you no heart for all this?"


She looked about her at the silent garden, the deepening shadows,

the darkening sky. Above her head, now, high in the air were the

faintly rustling palm leaves. Behind the palms stretched the wall,

high and blankly impassable. She felt strange, unreal.... Her very

fright was unreal.


"Tell me," he was saying, his voice low and caressing, "are there

many girls like you—in your America?"


She tried to speak quite easily, quite simply. "You have been in

England and France, Captain Kerissen, and you have seen many

Americans traveling there."


"I have seen many—yes. But not like you." She looked swiftly at

him, then more swiftly away. His eyes were glowing with a look of

deep excitement; his teeth flashed white under his small, dark

mustache. "Shall I tell you how you appear beside those others?"


"No, thank you," the girl answered with a hurried crispness which

brought a stare and then a low laugh from him.


"You have been told so often?" he suggested.


"I never permit myself to be told at all!" Anger made her young

voice imperious, but her heart was beating furiously. Involuntarily

she quickened her steps and he reached his hand to her bare forearm

and held her back.


"Pardon—but you are too quick."


She stood rigid, some deep instinct warning her not to resist. The

situation had gone to the man's head, she felt dumbly; his courtesy

was only a scant veneer over that Oriental cast of view which, like

the Latin, reads every accident of propinquity as opportunity. His

hand fell away and they walked on in slower time. When he spoke his

voice betrayed the feeling quickening within him.


"Then I have a pleasure before me, for you will listen, please. To

me your sister Americans are like big, bright flowers which grow by

the wayside where every wind blows hard upon them. And each receives

the dust of the footsteps of many men till comes the one who shall

possess her. But he does not bear her away. He puts his name upon

her, but leaves her out in the same field where every passerby may

look and handle——"


"You are dreadfully rude," said Arlee clearly. "You don't understand

at all. I thought you knew better."


"Ah, I know! Was I not in England and did I not hear men talk—yes,

of sisters and wives with bold words and laughter? Not so of our

ladies—they are sacred names not to be spoken by another.... But I

do not wish to speak of these others of your race. I speak of you."


"Really, I would rather you would not speak of me."


"But I wish to tell you." His voice was no louder; it was even

lower, but it took on a note of authority. Arlee was silent, a chill

creeping up about her heart—like a rising tide....


"You are a flower upon a height," he said, and his tones were soft

again and gently caressing, "laughing at others because you know you

are so high above them, and so proud. The blue of the skies is in

your eyes, and the gold of the sun in your hair. You have a beauty

that is too bright to be endured—it burns a man's heart like a

flame.... It was never meant to shine in a common field. It must be

guarded, revered, adored—a princess upon a height——"


"You have an Oriental imagination," said Arlee Beecher, and prayed

God her voice did not tremble. "I must ask you not to pay me such

compliments while I am your guest."


"No?... Why not?"


"They—are embarrassing."


"Embarrassment is an emotion rare to find among your ladies—it is

the dewy bloom upon your own perfect innocence.... Ah, I wish you

spoke my language! I could tell you many things——"


"Your English is excellent," said the white-faced girl. "Did you

learn it at Oxford or before?"


He did not pause for such foolish questionings. "Why do you not wish

me to tell you what you are?" he said reproachfully. "Is it because

you doubt that I mean it?"


"Because I am not used to such compliments—and I would rather not

hear them now. I am your guest and I am very tired. I must go in."


It was very dark in the garden. And it was still and unutterably

lonely. Only the stars burned above them in the heavens; only the

light wind of the desert stirred. From the far distance the muffled

beat of the tom-tom sounded. Surely, thought Arlee, surely she was

dreaming.... This could not be Arlee Beecher, here with this

man—this Turk.


"I must go in," she repeated, with a heightening of assurance.


As he looked down at her for a moment that chill dread seemed to

lay its icy hands on her very heart as she glimpsed something of the

tumult within his eyes. She had a vision of him as a man capable of

all, reckless, impassioned, poised upon the brink of some desperate

plunge.... Then the hands of consequences seemed to lay compelling

hold upon him; the fire was extinguished; the vision gone like a

mirage. His eyes were friendly, his lips smiling, as he bowed to

her, in deferential courtesy, to all appearances a gentleman of her

world.


"I must not tire my guest," he said, and stood aside to let her pass

up the narrow stone steps.


"We shall have other walks," he added, and the chill, delicate

menace of those words went with Arlee Beecher to the rose and white

room, and kept her sorry company through the long and restless

hours.


    CHAPTER V


    WITHIN THE WALLS


Again the knocking, muffled but softly insistent, and Arlee's eyes,

heavy with tardy sleep, came slowly open, resting blankly on the

glittering strangeness of the room. The daylight was streaming in

the wide windows, striking brightly on the white enameled furniture

which had glimmered so ghost-like through the wakeful darkness of

the night, and flung back in dancing points of color from the

mirrors and the glass and gold of toilet pieces. The air was hot and

close, as if the first freshness of the morning was already past.


Again through the heavy door came the knocking and the soft

reassurance of a girl's voice. Arlee sprang from the couch where she

had lain down that night, not undressed, but with her white frock

exchanged for the negligée she had found laid out for her among

other things, and hurried toward the door where she had piled two

chairs to supplement the lock—a foolish-looking barricade in the

shining light of day, she thought, her lips lifting whimsically.


The young Turkish maid entered with a huge jar of water which she

emptied into the bath, returning to the door to take in another and

yet another and another from some unseen porter, and pouring these

into the bath, she added a spray of perfume and laid out powders and

towels, smiling the while at Arlee, with the fascinated interest of

a child.


"Do you speak English?" said Arlee eagerly.


But the girl laughed and shook her head at the question, and at the

French and German with which Arlee next addressed her, and answered

in soft Turkish, at which it was Arlee's turn to laugh and shake her

head. But she felt a little rueful behind her pleasant smiling. She

wished she could talk with the girl. She wondered about her. She had

very handsome dark eyes, though perhaps overbold at times, but her

lips were thick and her nose was flattened as if generations of

yashmak-wearing women had crushed every hope of contour.


The cool freshness of the water was grateful to her senses. It was a

plunge back into sanity and normal life again, drowning those ghosts

of vague foreboding and anxieties which had kept such unpleasant

vigil with her, and when the Turkish girl returned with a tray,

Arlee was able to sit and eat breakfast with a trace of amusement at

the oddity of the affair—sipping coffee in this Parisian boudoir

overlooking an Egyptian garden.


As she was buttering a last crumb of toast the girl re-entered with

a box from the florist. Her white teeth flashing at Arlee in a smile

of admiring interest, she broke the cord with thick fingers and

Arlee found the box full of roses, creamy pink and dewy fresh. The

Captain's card was enclosed, and across the back of it he had

written a message:


      I am sending out for some flowers for our guest and I

      hope that they will convey to her my greeting. If there

      is anything that you would have, it is yours if it is in

      my power to give. My sister is indisposed, but will visit

      you when her indisposition will permit. This afternoon I

      will see you and report the result of our protests to the

      authorities. Until then, be tranquil, and accommodate

      yourself here.


A tacit apology, thought Arlee, pondering the dull letter a moment,

then dropping it to touch the roses with light fingers. The young

man's wits had evidently returned with the sun. He had utterly lost

them last night with the starshine and the shadows and his Oriental

conception of the intimacy of the situation—but, after all, he had

too much good sense not to be aware of the folly of annoying her.

Her cheeks flushed a little warmer at the memory of the bold words

and the lordly hand on her arm, and her heart quickened in its

beating. She had certainly been playing with fire, and the sparks

she had so ignorantly struck had lighted for her an unforgettable

glimpse of the Oriental nature beneath all its English polish, but

she imagined, very fearlessly, that the spark was out. She was not a

nature that was easily alarmed or daunted; beneath her look of

delicate fragility was a very sturdy confidence, and she had the

implicit sense of security instinct in the kitten whose blithe days

have known nothing but kindness. Yet she felt herself tremendously

experienced and initiated....


She wrote back a word of thanks for the flowers and a request for

writing paper and ink, and when they were brought she wrote three

most urgent letters, and after an instant's hesitation a fourth—to

the Viceroy himself. Feeling that his mail might be bulky, she

marked it "Immediate" in large characters and gave them to the maid,

who nodded intelligently and shuffled away.


It was very odd, she thought then, that she had no letters. By now

the Evershams must surely have written—she had begged them to....

But she was not going to be silly and panicky, she determinedly

informed that queer little catch in her side which came at the

thought of her isolation, and humming defiantly she sat down at the

white piano and opened the score of a light opera which she knew:


          Say not love is a dream, 

              Say not that hope is vain ...


She had danced to that tune last night—no, the night before

last—danced to it with that extraordinarily impulsive young man

from home—for all America was now home to her spirit. And she had

promised to see him last night. She wondered what he had thought of

her absence.... She could imagine the Evershams dolefully deploring

her rashness, yet not without a totally unconscious tinge of proper

relish at its prompt punishment. They were such dismal old dears!

They would complain—they must have made her the talk of the hotel

by now. Robert Falconer would enjoy that! And his sister and Lady

Claire would ask about her, and Lady Claire would say, "How

odd—fancy!" in that rather clipped and high-bred voice of hers....

But she was not going to think about it!


She opened more music, stared wonderingly at the unfamiliar pages,

read the English translation beneath the German lines, then pushed

them away, her cheeks the pinker. They were as bad as French

postcards, she thought, aghast. Whose room was this, anyway? Whose

piano was this? Whose was the lacy negligée she had worn and the

gossamer lingerie the maid had placed in the chiffonier for her? Was

she usurping her hostess's boudoir?


She began to walk restlessly up and down the room, feeling time

interminable, hating each lagging second of delay.


Then came a tray of luncheon, and lying upon it a yellow envelope.

With an eagerness that hurt in its keenness she snatched it up and

tore out the folded sheet. Her eyes leaped down the lines. Then

slowly they followed them again:


      I think it very strange of you to leave us like that, but

      of course you are your own mistress. We are sorry and

      hope it will soon be over and you will join us again,

      unless you prefer your other friends, the Maynards. We

      have packed your clothes and sent them to Cook's for your

      orders, and we have paid your hotel bill. Let us know

      when you can join us.


 Mrs. Eversham.


That was all. No word of real sympathy—no declaration of help.

Passive acceptance of her predicament—perhaps indeed a retributive

feeling of its fitness for her folly. They were annoyed.... Packing

her clothes must have been a bother—so was paying her hotel bill.


She crumpled the telegram with an angry little hand. Evidently they

had done none of the telephoning she had begged of them. Surely

there would have been time for that, if only they had hurried a

little! She remembered with a sort of hopeless rage their maddening

deliberateness.... Well, they were gone off to the Nile—the

telegram, she saw, had been sent as they were on their way to the

boat—and she had nothing more to hope from them! But surely the

other people, the consul, the ambassador, the mysterious medical

authorities, would understand when they had read her letters.


She sent another note to the Captain, asking to be called when the

doctor came, and then she sat down at the little white table and

began again to write.


But not to Falconer. Never would she beg of him, never, she

resolved, with a tightening of her soft lips. She would never let

him know how miserable she was over this stupid scrape; when she

returned to the hotel she would carry affairs with a high hand and

hold forth upon the interesting quaintness of her experience and the

old-world charm of her hostess. She laughed, in angry mockery. Never

to him, after their quarrel, would she confess herself.


The letter was to a young man whose gray eyes she remembered as very

kind and whose chin as very vigorous. He would do things, she

thought. And he would understand—he was an American. And dimly she

felt that she didn't want him to think she had utterly forgotten

her promise of the evening before last, and she didn't want him to

be filled with whatever dismal impression the Evershams were giving

out. So she dwelt very lightly upon her annoyance at being detained,

and asked him please to see the consul or the English Ambassador or

somebody in power and hurry matters up a little, as her rightful

caretakers had taken themselves off to the Nile. And she said

nothing stupid about the strangeness of her writing to him after

only speaking to him twice and never being really presented. She

merely added, "Please hurry things—I hate being a prisoner," and

sealed and addressed it with a flourish to William B. Hill, and sent

it off by the maid, and felt oddly comforted by the memory of

Billy's vigorous chin.


The heat of the rose-and-white room was stifling now as the slant

sun of afternoon burned through the closed blinds and drawn

hangings. Languidly she curled up upon the sofa and pillowed her

heavy head on the scented silk, and so, drowsing with fitful dreams,

she lost the sense of the lagging hours.


She roused to find the maid at hand with more water jars, and, when

she had bathed, the girl reappeared and beckoned her to follow.

Perhaps the doctor was below, thought Arlee; perhaps the consulate

had sent for her! With flying feet she followed down the dark old

stairs and across the anteroom into the dim salon, only to find a

candle-lighted table set for dinner in the middle of the room and

Captain Kerissen bowing ceremoniously beside it.


In the blankness of her disappointment she scarcely grasped what he

was saying about the dinner hour being early and his sister being

indisposed. She interrupted with a breathless demand for news:


"And my letters—surely there has been time for answers!"


"Answers, yes," he replied, "but not such as I could wish for your

sake."


"You mean——?"


"The English have written to me and request that I cease to trouble

the department with my importunities. For I myself had written to

them again, that I might find grace in your eyes by accomplishing

your desires. They say to me that it is useless. The plague is more

serious than the convenience of my visitors, and all must be done

according to rule. When there is no danger you may depart."


The crash of hopes went echoing to the farthest reaches of her

consciousness. But pride stiffened her to dissemble, and she tried

to smile as she mechanically accepted the Captain's invitation to be

seated at the little candle-lighted table.


"There was no word to me personally?" she asked.


"None, but the telegram which came this morning. I judged that it

was not of a significance, for you did not send me a report."


"No—it was not of a significance," she repeated, with a ghost of a

little smile. "It was from the Evershams."


"Ah! Their condolences, I think?... And is it that they still make

the Nile trip?"


"Yes.... They went this morning." She spoke hesitantly, averse to

having this eager-eyed young host perceive how truly deserted she

was. "They expect me to take the express train later and join them."


"It is only a night's ride to Assouan." He spoke soothingly. "But

you are not eating, Miss Beecher. I recommend this consommé."


It was worth the recommending. Miss Beecher spooned it slowly, then

demanded, "Why was I not called when the doctor came?"


"But he does not come! Perhaps he is afraid"—the young man's brows

and shoulders rose expressively—"but certainly he does not risk

himself. If a servant is ill we are to tell a soldier and the sick

one will be taken away to the house of plague—bien simple. It is

so hard that I am helpless for you," he said, with sympathetic

concern, then added, with an air of boyish confession, "although I

do not deny that it is happiness for me to see you here."


The look in his eyes forced itself upon her. And the secret sense of

discomfort intruded like a third presence at the little table.


In a clear voice of dry indifference: "That's very polite of you,"

she remarked, "but I imagine you are pretty furious, too, to be kept

pent up in somebody else's house like this."


"But this is not somebody else's house," he smiled, his eyes

observant of her quick glance and look of confusion. "I am chez

moi."


"Oh! I thought—I was visiting your sister."


"My sister lives with me. She is a widow—and we are both alone."


"She does not seem to care for company."


"She is indisposed. She regrets it exceedingly." The young man

looked grave and solicitous. "But I trust your comfort is not being

neglected?"


"Oh, my comfort is being beautifully attended to, thank you, but my

patience is wearing itself out!" Arlee spoke with a blithe

assumption of humor.


"I wish that I could extend the resources of my palace for you."


"You must tell me about the palace. I shall want to picture it to my

friends when I tell them about it. It's very old, isn't it? It must

have seen a great deal of life."


"Ah, yes, it has seen life—and what life! Quelle vie!" A flash of

real enthusiasm dispelled the suave indolence of his handsome

features.


"Have you seen those old rooms? Those rooms that were built by the

Mamelukes? There is nothing now in Cairo like them."


"I thought them very beautiful," said the girl. "Tell me about those

Mamelukes who lived here."


"They were men," he said with pride, his eyes kindling, "men who

lived as kings dare not live to-day!" The subject of those old days

and those old ancestors of his was evidently dear to the young

modern, and he launched into an animated sketch of those times,

trying to picture for Arlee something of the glowing pageant of the

past. And as she listened she found her own high spirit stirring in

sympathy with the barbaric strength of those old nobles, riding to

battle on their fiery Arab steeds, waging their private wars,

brooking no affront, no command, working no other man's will.


"They knew both power and beauty," he declared, "like the Medici of

Florence. There are no leaders like that in the modern world. To-day

beauty is beggared, and power is lusterless.... And taste? Taste is

a hundred-headed Hydra, roaring with a hundred tongues!"


"While in the old days in Cairo it only roared with the tongues of

Mamelukes?" Arlee suggested, a glint of mischief in her smile.


He nodded. "It should be the concern of nobles—not of the rabble.

That is why I should hate your America—where the rabble prevail."


"It's not nice of you to call me a rabble," said Arlee, busy with

her plate of chicken. "But I want to hear more about your old

Mamelukes. Is the story true about the Sultan's being so afraid of

them that he had them taken by surprise and killed?"


"He did well to fear them," said Kerissen. "And he, too, was a

strong man who had the power to clear his own path. Those nobles

were in the path of Mohammed Ali. They were too strong for him, he

knew it—and they knew it and were not afraid. On one day they were

all assembled at the Citadel, at the ceremony which Mohammed Ali was

giving in honor of his son, Toussoum. It was the first of March, in

1811, and my ancestor, the father of my father's father, rode out

from this palace, through the gate by the court, which is the old

gate, in his most splendid attire to greet his sovereign's son. The

emerald upon his turban was as large as a man's eye, and his sword

hilt was studded with turquoise and pearls and the hilt was a blazon

of gold. His robes were of silk, gold threaded, and his horse was

trapped with gold and silver and a diamond hung between her eyes....

The Mamelukes were fêted and courted, and then, as they were leaving

the Citadel—you have been up there?" he broke off to question, and

Arlee nodded, her eyes wide and intent like a listening child's,

"and you recall that deep, crooked way between the high walls,

between the fortified doors? Imagine to yourself that deep way

filled with men on horseback, quitting the Citadel, having taken

leave of their Sultan—they were a picture of such pride and pomp as

Egypt has never seen again. And then the treachery—the great gates

closed before them and behind them, the terrible fire upon them from

all sides, the bullets of the hidden Albanians pouring down like the

hosts of death—the uproar, the cries of horses, the shouts of the

trapped men, and then all the tumult dying, dying, down to the last

moan and hiccough of blood."


"But one escaped?" questioned the girl, breaking the silence which

had followed the cessation of his voice. "Is it true that one really

escaped?"


"Anym-bey—yes, he was the only one that escaped that massacre. He

had a fierce horse which gave him pain to mount, and he was still in

the courtyard of the palace when he heard the outburst of shots and

then the cries. He comprehended. Stripping his turban from his head

he bound it over the eyes of his stallion and, spurring to a gallop,

he dashed out over the parapet of the Citadel and down—down—down!

Magnificent! He did not die of it, but alas! he did not escape.

Wounded as he was he managed to reach the house of a relative, but

the soldiers of the Sultan tracked him there and seized him.... He

was killed."


"Oh, the pity—after that splendid dash!" Arlee stopped and looked

around her, at the strange shadowy room hung with its old

embroideries and latticed with its ancient screening. "This room

makes it all so real, somehow," she murmured. "I didn't believe it

all when the dragoman told me—probably because he showed me the

mark of the horse's hoof in the stone of the parapet! I thought it

was all a legend—like the mark."


"Did he show you, too, the bulrush where Moses was found and the

indentures in the stones in the crypt of the Coptic Church where

Saint Joseph and Mary sat to rest after the flight into Egypt?"

laughed the Captain. And, with a teasing smile, "Ah, what imbeciles

they think you tourists!"


But Arlee merely laughed with him, while the old woman changed the

plates for dessert. Her spirits had brightened mercurially. This was

really interesting.... Uneasiness had vanished.


"Is that an old Mameluke throne?" she asked, pointing to the raised

chair upon the dais, with its heavy, dusty draperies.


The Captain glanced at it and shook his head, smiling faintly. "No,

that is the throne of marriage." He pushed away his sweet and

lighted a cigarette. "That is where sits the bride when she has been

brought to the home of her husband—there she holds her reception.

Those are the fêtes to which the English ladies come in such

curiosity." His smile was not quite pleasant.


"You cannot blame them for feeling a real—interest," said Arlee

hesitantly.


"Their interest—pah!" he flung back excitably and made a violent

gesture with his cigarette. "They peer at the bride with their

haggard eyes, and they say, 'What! You have not seen your husband

till to-day! How strange—how strange! Has he not written to you?

Suppose you do not like him,' and they laugh and add, 'Fancy a girl

among us being married like that!'... The imbeciles—whose own

marriages are abominations!"


For a moment Arlee was silent, instinct and impulse warring within

her. The man was a maniac upon those subjects, and it was madness to

exchange a word with him—but her young anger darted through her

discretion.


"They are not abominations!" she gave back proudly.


"But I know—I know—have I not been at marriages in England?" he

declared, with startling fierceness. "Men and women crowd about the

bride; they press in line and kiss her; bearded mouths and shaven

lips, young and old, they brush off that exquisite bloom of

innocence which a husband delights to discover. Her lips are soiled,

fanée.... And then the man and woman go away together into a

public hotel or a train, and the people laugh and shout after them,

and hurl shoes and rice, with a great din of noise. I have heard!"

He stopped, looked a moment at the flushed curve of Arlee's averted

face, the droop of her shadowy lashes which veiled the confusion and

anger of her spirit, and then, leaning forward, his eyes still upon

her, he spoke in a lower, softer tone, caressing in its inflections.


"With us it is not so," he said. "We have dignity in our rejoicing,

and delicacy in our love. The bride is brought in state to the home

of her husband, no eyes in the street resting upon her, and there,

in his home, her husband welcomes her and retires with his friends,

while she holds a reception with hers. Later the husband will come

home and greet her, and he wooes her to him as tenderly as he would

gather a flower that he would wear. He is no rude master, no tyrant,

as you have been taught to think! He wins her heart and mind to him;

it is the conquest of the spirit!... I tell you that our men alone

understand the secret of women! Is not the life he gives her better

than what you call the world? The woman blooms like a flower for her

husband alone; his eyes only may dwell upon the beauty of her face;

for him alone, her lips—her lips——"


The young man's voice, grown husky, died away. A dreadful stillness

followed, a stillness vibrating with unspoken thought. Her eyes

lifted toward him, then fled away, so full of strange, dark,

desirous things was the look she encountered. Abruptly he rose—he

was coming toward her, and she struggled suddenly to her feet,

battling against the cold terror which held her dumb and unready.

She flung one arm out before her and found it grasped by hands that

were hot and burning. The touch shot her with a fierce rage that

cleared her brain and unlocked her lips.


"Is that—the conquest of the spirit?" she gasped, and for an

instant the white-hot scorn in her eyes, flashing into his, hid any

hint of the fear in her.


Involuntarily his grasp relaxed, and violently she wrenched her arm

away and stood facing him, a little white-clad image of war, her

eyes blazing, her breast heaving, a defiant child in her intrepidity

who gave him back look for look.


In his eyes there glowed and battled a conflict of desires. For one

moment they seemed flaming at her from the dark, like some wild

creature ready to spring; the next moment they were human,

recognizable. She read there grudging admiration, arrested ardor,

irresolution, dubiety, and secret calculation.


Then he put both hands behind him and bowed with ceremony.


"The spirit," he remarked dryly, "is worth the conquest."


She said proudly, "You would not like your English friends to know

how you treat a guest!"


At that she saw his lip curl in irony—at the mention of the

English, perhaps, or in disdain at the appearance of fearing a

threat, however powerful that threat might be. He answered with

calmness, "It is not the English I am considering.... Nor have I

treated my guest so ill, chère petite mademoiselle.... If for the

moment I mistook my cue—that look within your face—I ask grace for

my stupidity."


Suddenly she was frightened. He did not look like a man who wholly

surrenders his desires. His eyes seemed to say to her, "Wait—the

last word has not been spoken!" She felt her knees trembling.


With an effort she got out, "It is granted—but never again—must

you misunderstand. An American girl——"


She stopped. There was a lump in her throat. Across a bright,

familiar veranda she could hear a clear, sharp voice answer,

"American goose!" She saw a lean tanned face burn red with anger. A

wave of loneliness went through her. The irony of it was pitiless.

How right Robert Falconer had been!


He was staring down at the table beside him, frowning, considering.

She saw with peculiar distinctness how the cigarette he had dropped

had burned a hole in the fine linen. One of the candles was dripping

lopsidedly. She thought some one ought to right it. She wondered if

that soft step, hesitating, behind the curtains, was the serving

woman's, and she turned toward that doorway.


"I don't think I care for any coffee," she said, with an air of

careless finality. "I think I will go back to my room. Good

evening."


He followed her to the doorway, drawing aside the curtains as she

passed into the anteroom, and opening the door at the foot of the

steps, with an answering, "Good evening," and an added, "Till

to-morrow, Mademoiselle." And then, as the door closed below her,

she paused on the dark stairs and huddled against the wall,

listening to the faint footfalls from below, crossing and

recrossing. Then, when the silence seemed continual, she tiptoed

down the stairs again, softly pushed open the unlatched door, stole

across the anteroom to the curtained doorway and peered in.


The salon was empty, and in its center the supper table stood

stripped of its cloth and candles. Only the pale light from the

windows dispelled the growing dark. Like a little white wraith Arlee

fled through the room and turned the handle of the door at the head

of the haremlik stairs. The door was locked.


She shook the handle, first cautiously, then with increasing

violence, then she ran back into the room to the nearest window,

staring down through the screen. It would have been a steep jump

down into the street, but her tense nerves would have dared it

instantly. Her hands tore at the mashrubiyeh, but the tiny

spindles and delicate curves held sound and firm. She beat against

it with fierce little fists; she leaped against it with all her

trifling weight. It did not yield an inch. Was there iron in all

that delicacy? Or was that old wood impregnable in its grim trust?


Wildly she glanced back into the room. Suppose she took a chair and

beat at this carving—could she clear a way before the servants

came? Could she take the jump successfully? She gazed down into the

street, estimating the fall, trying to calculate the hurt.


As she gazed, her eyes grew fixed and filled with utter amazement.

Down the street, on a black horse that arched his curving neck and

danced on light, fleet feet, rode a man in a uniform of green and

gold. He sat erect, his clear-cut profile toward her. The next

instant his horse, side-stepping at a blowing paper, turned his face

into view. It was Captain Kerissen.


Some one was stirring in the anteroom, and Arlee darted to the left

of the throne-chair and through the door there which stood ajar.

She was in a dim salon, like the one that she had left, but smaller,

and across from her was another door. She flew toward it, wild with

the hope of escape, and it opened before her eager hands.


From the shadows of the room it disclosed came a figure with a quick

cry. So suddenly it came, so tumultuously it threw itself toward her

that Arlee had a startled vision of bare arms, glittering with

jeweled bands, arrested outstretched before her as the low gladness

of the cry broke in an angry guttural. Slowly the arms dropped in a

gesture of despair. She saw a face, distorted, passionate, grow

haggard beneath its paint in the reversal of hope.


"Madame!" stammered Arlee to that strange figure of her hostess.

"Madame—Oh, pardon me," she cried, snatching at her French, "but

tell me how I can go away from here. Tell me——"


"C'est toi—va-t-en!" the woman answered in a voice of smothered

fury. She made a menacing gesture toward the door. "Va-t-en."

Suddenly her voice rose in a passion of angry phrases that were

indistinguishable to the girl, and then she broke off as suddenly

and flung herself down upon a couch. From behind her the old woman

came shuffling forth and put a hand on Arlee's arm, and Arlee felt

the muscles of that hand as strong and rigid as a man's. Utterly

confused and bewildered, the girl suffered herself to be led back

through the rooms to the foot of her stairs.


"Mariayah!" screamed the old woman, and after a moment the voice of

waiting-maid answered from above, and then as Arlee dumbly ascended

the stairs, the voice of the old woman rose with her in shrill

admonition.


It was the voice of a jailer, thought the white-lipped girl, and

that little, dark-skinned maid who waited upon her so eagerly, with

such sidelong glances of strange interest, was the tool of a jailer.

And though the turning of the key in her own hand gave her a

momentary sense of refuge from them, it was but a false illusion of

the moment. There was neither refuge nor safety here. She was being

deceived ...


The quarantine was lifted.


How else could the Captain be cantering down the street? He did

not look like a man escaping.... Perhaps he had bribed the

doorkeeper—that which he had declared impossible for Arlee....

But certainly he was deceiving her.


Like a swollen river bursting its banks, her racing mind, wild with

suspicion, surged out of its simple channels and swirled in every

direction.... What did he mean? What was he trying to do? Keep her

in ignorance of the outside world, detain her as long as he dared

while the Evershams' absence left her friendless, and inflict his

dreadful love-making upon her? Perhaps he thought that he could

fascinate her!


She laughed aloud, but it was such a ghostly little laugh that it

set her nerves jumping. She stopped in her feverish pacing of the

floor; she tried to control her racing mind, she tried to be very

calm and to plan.


Had he sent all those letters she had written? Steadily she stared

at the possibility that he had not. But at least the Evershams knew

where she was. Even the meager warmth of their telegram was like an

outstretched hand through the dark. She clung tight to it.


It was absurd to be frightened. He would never dare to annoy

her—never, in his sober senses. When they were alone together he

had lost his head, but that was accident—impulse...


She rolled the divan against the locked door. She piled two chairs

upon it.


No, of course, she had nothing really to fear from him. He was too

wise not to understand the gulf between them. To-morrow she would

confront him flatly with his deceit; she would array the power of

the authorities behind her race. She would sweep instantly from that

ill-omened palace. There would be no more philandering.


Her lips moved as she silently rehearsed the mighty speeches that

she would make, and all the while as she leaned there against a

window, staring strangely through the candle-light at the barricade

before the door, she could think of nothing but how mad and unreal

it all seemed—like some bad dream from which she would wake in an

instant.


But she did not wake. The dream persisted, and the iron bars across

her window were very tangible. Down below her in the garden the old

lebbek tree rustled stealthily in the stillness. Gusty clouds hid

the stars. In the distance the interminable tom-tom beat.


She cast herself into the bed and cried convulsively, like a

desperately frightened child, while the awful sense of terror and

utter loneliness seemed to be rolling over and over her, like an

unending sea. Her sobbing racked her from head to foot. She cried

until she was spent with weakness. Then, her wet face still pressed

against the pillow and her tangled hair flung out in disordered

curls, she fell at last into the deep sleep of exhausted youth.


She woke with a smothered cry. In the darkness a hand had touched

her.


    CHAPTER VI


    A GIRL IN THE BAZAARS


Billy slapped on his hat with a clap of violence. She might have

just seen him! Then he got up and marched down the steps. There

was no more use in camping on that veranda. There was no more use in

guarding that entrance. When a girl went whirling off in a

limousine, "all dolled up" as his academic English put it, that girl

wasn't going to be back in five minutes. And anyway he'd be blessed

if he lay around in the way any longer like a doormat with "Welcome"

inscribed upon the surface.


So this spurt of masculine shame at his swift surrender to her, and

his masculine resentment at being ignored as she went by, sent him

hurrying down the street resolved not to return till dinner.


From habit his steps took him to the bazaars. But the zest of that

bright pageant was dulled for him. The color was gone even from the

red canopies, and the excitement had vanished from the din of

noises, the interest fled from the grave figures squatting in their

cubby holes of shops draped with silky rags or sewing upon scarlet

slippers. He listened apathetically to the warring shouts of the

donkey boys and the anathemas of a jostled water carrier stooping

under his distended goatskin, then dodged out of the way of a

goaded donkey and turned into one of the passages where the

four-footed could not penetrate.


For a few moments the bargaining over a silver bracelet between two

beturbaned and berobed Arabs caught the surface of his attention,

and as the wrangling became a bedlam of imprecations, and the

explosive gestures made physical violence a development apparently

of mere seconds, Billy's eyes brightened and he estimated chances.

But as he picked his favorite there was one final frenzy of fury,

and then—peace and joy, utter calm on the wild waters! One Arab

counted out the coins from a little leather bag about his neck and

the other passed over the bracelet, and with mutual salaams and

smiling speeches, behold! the affair was accomplished.


Disgustedly Billy turned away. Then on the other side of him he

heard a voice, a sweet and rather high voice, with a musical

intensity of inflection that was as English as the Union Jack.


"Yes, it's sweetly pretty," the voice was saying irresolutely,

"but I don't think I quite care to—not at that price."


"I—I will buy it for you—yes?" said another voice. "It is made for

you—so 'sweetly pretty' as you say."


Billy turned. A slim, tall girl in a dark blue frock was standing

before a counter of Oriental jewelry, her head turned, with an air

of startled surprise, to the man on the other side of her who had

just spoken. He was a short, stout, blond man, heavily flushed,

showily dressed, with a fulsome beam in his light-blue eyes and an

ingratiating grin beneath his upturned straw-colored mustaches.


The girl turned her head away toward the shop-keeper and put back

the turquoise-studded buckle she held in her hand. "No, I do not

care for it," she said in a steady voice whose coldness was for the

intruder and turned away.


Billy had a glimpse of scarlet cheeks and dark lashed eyes before

the blond young man again took his attention.


"You do not like it—no?" he said, blocking her path, his face

thrust out to smile into hers. "But I buy you anything you wish—I

make you one present——"


The girl gave a quick look about. But she was in a pocket; for there

was no other exit to that line of shops but the path he was

blocking. All about her the dark-skinned venders and shoppers, the

bearded men, the veiled women, the impish urchins, were watching the

encounter with beady eyes of malicious interest.


Billy took a quick step forward and touched the man on the arm. "Let

this lady pass, please," he said.


The German confronted him with blood-shot blue eyes that ceased to

smile and clearly welcomed the belligerency.


"Gott! Who are you?" he derided. "Get out—get out the way."


"Get out yourself," said Billy, and stepping in front of the fellow

he extended a rigid arm, leaving a passage for the girl behind him.


"Oh, thank you," he heard her say, and as he half turned his head at

the grateful murmur he felt a sudden staggering blow on the side of

his face. He whirled about, on guard, and as the man struck again,

lunging heavily in his intoxication, Billy knocked up the fist as it

came.


"You silly fool!" he said impatiently, and as the man made a blind

rush upon him he caught him and by main force flung him off, but his

own foot struck something slippery and he lurched and went down,

with a wave of intense disgust, into the dirt of the bazaars. He

heard a chorus of cries and imprecations about him; he jumped up

instantly, looking for his assailant, but the German was clinging to

the front of the jewelry booth. "Meet you—satisfaction—honor," he

was saying stupidly.


A native policeman elbowed his way through the throng, urging some

Arabic question upon Billy, who caught its import and replied with

the few sentences of reassurance at his command, pointing to the

banana peel as the cause of all. A fat dragoman had suddenly

appeared from nowhere and was hurriedly attempting to lead away the

intoxicated one.


"You in charge of him? Take him to his hotel and throw him in the

tub," said Billy curtly, and the dragoman replied with profound

respect that he would do even as the heaven-born commanded.


Brushing off his clothes Billy shouldered his way out of the throng

and was met by two bright and grateful eyes and a slim, bare,

outstretched hand.


"Thank you so much—I am so sorry," said the musical voice.


"You shouldn't have waited," said Billy, with a prompt pressure of

the friendly little hand. "It might have been a real row."


"I couldn't run away," she said in serious protest at such

ingratitude. "I had to see what happened to you. And I am so sorry

about your clothes."


"Not hurt a particle—I chose a fortunate place to drop," he

returned lightly, but distinctly chagrined that he had dropped.


"It was so fine of you," she answered, "just to parry him like

that—when he'd been drinking. I saw what you did." And then she

added, very matter-of-factly, "And I'm afraid your nose is bleeding,

too."


Billy put up a startled hand. In the general soreness he had not

noticed that warm trickle. His whole face turned as scarlet as the

shameless blood. Frantically he rummaged with the other hand.


The girl thrust a square of white linen upon him. "Please take

mine—it will ruin your clothes if it gets on them."


Her immense practicality refused to be embarrassed in the least.

Feeling immensely foolish Billy accepted hers, but then he

discovered his own handkerchief and stuffed hers away into his

pocket.


"You're a trump," he said heartily. "And it's all right now—all but

the swelling, I suppose." He sounded rueful. He had remembered his

engagement for the evening.


Her head a little aslant, the girl regarded him critically. "N-no,

it doesn't seem to be swelling," she observed. "Of course it's a

little red but that will pass."


They were walking side by side out of the narrow street and now, on

a crowded corner, they paused and looked around. "I left Miss

Falconer at the Maltese laces," she murmured, and to the laces they

turned their steps.


Miss Falconer was still bargaining. She was a middle aged lady,

Roman nosed and sandy-haired, and she brought to Billy in a rush the

realization that she was "sister" and the girl was Lady Claire

Montfort. The story of the encounter and Billy's hero part, related

by Lady Claire, appeared most disturbing to the chaperon.


"How awkward—how very awkward," she murmured, several times, and

Billy gathered from her covert glance upon him that part of the

awkwardness consisted in being saddled with his acquaintance. Then,

"Very nice of you, I'm sure," she added. "I hope the creature isn't

lingering about somewhere.... We'd better take a cab, Claire—I'm

sure we're late for tea."


"Let me find one," said Billy dutifully, and charging into the

medley of vehicles he brought forth a victoria with what appeared to

be the least villainous looking driver and handed in the ladies.


"Savoy Hotel, isn't it?" he added thoughtlessly, and both ladies'

countenances interrogated him with a varying nuance of question.


"I remember noticing you," he hastily explained. "I'm not exactly a

private detective, you know,"—the assurance seemed to leave Miss

Falconer cold—"but I do remember people. And then I heard you

spoken of by Miss Beecher."


The name acted curiously upon them. They looked at each other. Then

they looked at Billy. Miss Falconer spoke.


"Perhaps we can drop you at your hotel," said she. "Won't you get

in?"


He got in, facing them a little ruefully with his damaged

countenance, and subtly aware that this accession of friendliness

was not a gush of airy impulse.


"You know Miss Beecher then?" said Miss Falconer with brisk

directness.


"Slightly," he said aloud. To himself he added, "So far."


"Ah—in America?"


"No, in Cairo."


Miss Falconer looked disappointed. "But perhaps you know her

family?"


"No," said Billy. He added humorously, "But I'll wager I could guess

them all right."


"Can you Americans do that for one another? That is more than we can

venture to do for you," said the lady, and Billy was aware of irony.


"We know so little about your life, you see," the girl softened it

for him, with a direct and friendly smile, and then gazed watchfully

at her chaperon. She was a nice girl, Billy decided emphatically.


"How would you construct her family?" was the elder lady's next

demand.


"Oh, big people in a small town," he hazarded carelessly. "The kind

of place where the life isn't wide enough for the girl after all her

'advantages' and she goes abroad in search of adventure."


"Adventure," repeated Miss Falconer thoughtfully. She seemed to

have an idea, but Billy was certain it was not his idea.


He hastened to clarify the light he had tried to cast upon his

upsetting little countrywoman. "All life, you know, is an adventure

to the American girl," he generalized. "She is a little bit more on

her own than I imagine your girls are," and for the fraction of a

second his eyes wandered to the listening countenance of Lady

Claire, "and that rather exhilarates her. And she doesn't want

things cut and dried—she wants them spontaneous and unexpected—and

people, just as people, interest her tremendously. I think that's

why she's so unintelligible on the Continent," he added

thoughtfully. "They don't understand there that girlish love of

experience as experience—enjoyment of romance apart from results."


"Romance apart from results," repeated Miss Falconer in a peculiar

voice.


"I don't believe you quite get me," said Billy hastily. He felt

foolish and he felt resentful. And if these English women couldn't

understand the bright, volatile stuff that Arlee was made of, he

certainly was not going to talk about it. But Miss Falconer had one

more question for him.


"When you say big people in a small town do you mean her father

would be a sort of country squire?"


"More probably a captain of industry," Billy smiled.


"A captain—Oh, that is one of your phrases!"


"One of our phrases," he laughed, and then parried, "I thought you

were acquainted with Miss Beecher?"


"Quite slightly," said Miss Falconer in an aloof tone. "My brother

came over on the same ship with her—he came to join us here."


Billy experienced a flood of mental light. The brother—at the hotel

he had discovered that his name was Robert Falconer—was coming to

join his elder sister and her young charge. He had come on the same

steamer as Miss Beecher. Ergo, he was staying at the hotel where

Miss Beecher was and not with his sister. Billy comprehended the

anxiety of the lady with the Roman nose. He looked at Lady Claire

with a certain sympathy.


He caught her own eyes reconnoitering, and they each looked hastily

away.


Again Miss Falconer returned to her attack. "Then you really know

nothing positive of Miss Beecher's family?"


"Nothing in the world," said Billy cheerfully. "But why not ask Miss

Beecher?"


The lady made no reply. "Miss Beecher is a beautiful girl," said

Lady Claire hastily. "She's so beautiful that I suppose we are all

rather curious about her—of course people will ask about a girl

like that!"


"Of course," said Billy, and Lady Claire, perceiving that he

resented this catechism about his young countrywoman, and Miss

Falconer perceiving that nothing was to be gotten out of him, the

conversation was promptly turned into other channels, the vague,

general channels of comment upon Cairo.


The Evershams dined alone. Alternately, from their table to the

doorway went Billy's eager eyes, but no vision with shining curls

and laughing eyes appeared. Evidently she had stayed to dine with

whatever people she had gone to see. Robert Falconer was watching

that table, too.... Perhaps she would not return till late; perhaps

he would have only a tiny time with her that evening.... And he had

not been able to buy out that man's berth upon the steamer....


Consommé and whitebait, bœuf rôti and haricots vert and

crême de cérises succeeded one another in deepening gloom. The

whole dinner over, and she had not appeared!


He went out to the lounge and smoked with violence. Presently he saw

the Evershams in the doorway talking to Robert Falconer, and he

jumped up and hurried to join them. As he approached he heard the

word Alexandria spoken fretfully by Mrs. Eversham.


"Good evening, good evening," said Billy hurriedly to the ladies,

and being a young man of simple directness, undeterred by the

glacial tinge of the ladies' response—they had not forgotten his

defection of the evening before when they were entertaining him so

nicely—he put the question which had been tormenting him all

evening, "Where is Miss Beecher to-night?"


"Alexandria," said Mrs. Eversham again, and this time there was a

hint of malicious satisfaction in her voice.


"Alexandria?" Billy was incredulous. "Why I—I understood she was to

go up the Nile to-morrow morning."


"She was, but she has changed her mind. She had word from some

friends of hers while we were out this afternoon and she flew right

off to join them."


"You mean she isn't going up the Nile at all now?"


"I haven't an idea what she is going to do. She is not in our care

any longer. And I don't suppose the boat company will do anything

about her stateroom at this late date—certainly she can't expect us

to go to any trouble about it."


"She left us half her packing to do," Clara Eversham contributed,

addressing Falconer with plaintive mien, "and her hotel bill to pay.

She is the most unexpected creature!"


Two young men silently and heartily concurred.


"What was her hurry?" Billy demanded.


"Oh, she's going camping in the desert with them—that sort of thing

would fascinate her, you know. Her telegram wasn't very clear. She

just sent a wire from the station, I think, or from Cook's, with

some money for her bill by the boy. So careless, trusting him like

that!"


"I don't suppose he brought it all," Mrs. Eversham declared. "You

see, she didn't say how much she was sending—just said it was

enough for her bill."


Billy looked at Falconer. He admired the stolidity of that

sandy-haired young man's countenance. He envied the unrevealing

blankness of his eyes.


"May I ask where she is stopping in Alexandria?" he persisted.


Mrs. Eversham shook her head. "She didn't give any address—the best

hotel, I suppose, whatever that is."


"The Khedivial," Falconer supplied.


"She just said to send her things to Cook's and to write to her

there and she would write when she came back. She had been expecting

to meet those friends, the Maynards, later, but we had no idea that

she was going to run off with them like this. It's very upsetting."


"We shall miss her," said Clara Eversham suddenly, with a note of

sincerity that made Billy warm to her a trifle. So he bestirred

himself getting their after dinner coffee and remembered to send

Mohammed for the cream for her, and listened with a show of

attention to their interminable anecdotes and corrections. But his

mind was off on the way to Alexandria....


Not a word of farewell. Of course, they had not exactly arrived, in

those twenty-four hours, at a correspondence stage, but still she

had made a positive engagement for that evening—and she had known

he was trying to buy that berth. Only that morning she had listened

to his account of his endeavors with a mischievous light in her blue

eyes and a prankish smile edging her pink lips ... and she might,

after that, have left just a line to tell him to cancel his

arrangements.... But what could he expect from such a tricksy sprite

of a girl? Only twenty-seven hours before he had seen her,

flagrantly tardy, nonchalantly unrepentant, first mock and then

annihilate the worthy and earnest young Englishman who had

endeavored to correct her ways ... He had known then the volatile

stuff that she was made of—and had succumbed to it!


But he had succumbed. On that point he was most disastrously

certain. The memory of the young girl possessed him. Her beauty

haunted him, that spring-like beauty with its enchanting youth and

gaiety. And the spirit that animated that beauty, that young,

blithe, innocently audacious spirit which looked out on the world

with such sunnily trustful eyes, drew him with a golden cord.


He smoked many a pipe over it that night, his feet on the open

window ledge, his eyes on the far-spreading flat roofs, the distant

domes and minarets darkly silhouetted against the sky of softest,

deepest blue. The stars were silver bright. They spangled the heaven

with the radiance they never give to northern skies; they gleamed

like bright, wild creatures on their unearthly revels.... It would

be glorious camping in the desert on a night like this ... Heaven be

praised, he had not bought that berth ... Alexandria ... the

Maynards ... the desert ...


He knocked out the ashes from his last pipe and rose briskly. His

decision was made, but its success was on the knees of the great god

Luck.


    CHAPTER VII


    BILLY HAS HIS DOUBTS


The encounter in the bazaars that Thursday afternoon brought one

more result to young Hill besides the bruise upon his chin and the

privilege of bowing to Lady Claire and her vigilant chaperon, and

the presence of Lady Claire's little handkerchief in his coat

pocket.


It brought a young German, scrupulously sober, soberly apologetic,

in formal state to Billy's hotel upon Friday morning, whose card

announced him to be Frederick von Deigen and whose speech proclaimed

him to be utterly aghast at his own untoward behavior.


"I was not myself," he owned, with a sigh and a melancholy twist of

his upstanding mustaches. "I had been lunching alone—and it is bad

to lunch alone when one has a sadness. One drinks—to forget.... But

you are too young to understand." He waved his hand in compliment to

Billy's youth, then continued, with increasing energy, "But when I

find what dummheit I have done—how I have so rudely addressed the

young Fräulein with you, and have used my fists upon you, even to

the point of hurling you upon the street—I have no words for my

shame."


"Oh, it wasn't exactly a hurl," Billy easily amended. "There was a

banana peel where my heel happened to be—and I wasn't half

scrapping. I could see you weren't yourself."


"Indeed no! Would I," he struck himself gloomily upon the breast,

"would I intrude upon a young Fräulein, and attack her protector? It

was that bottle—that last bottle.... I knew—at the time.... I

offer you my apology. I can do no more—unless you would have

satisfaction—no?"


"I guess I had all the satisfaction that was coming to me

yesterday," said Billy. "You've got a fist like a professional. But

there's no harm done.... Only you want to get over taking that last

bottle and offering presents to young ladies," he concluded, with an

accent of youthful severity.


The German nodded a depressed head. His melancholy, bloodshot eyes

fixed themselves sadly upon Billy. "Ach, it is so," he assented

meekly, "but when one has a sadness—" He sighed.


"Yes, of course, that's tough," agreed Billy sympathetically. "I

hate a sadness."


"Perhaps you have known—?" The other's eyes lifted toward him, then

dropped dispiritedly. "But, no, you are too young. But I—Ach!" He

added in his own tongue a line of which Billy caught geliebt and

gelebt, and so nodded understandingly.


"That geliebing business is bad stuff," he returned, and again the

other tugged at his mustaches with a nervous hand and shook his big

blond head.


"She was to have met me here," he said abruptly. "She wrote—I was

to come quick—and then she comes not. That is woman, the ewige

weibliche." He scowled. "But, Gott, how enchantment was in her!"


Billy heard himself sigh in unison. The phrase suggested Arlee. And

the situation was not dissimilar. He felt a positive sympathy for

the big blond fellow in his pronounced clothes and glossy boots and

careful boutonnière.... He smiled in friendly fashion.


"She'll come along yet," he prophesied, "and if she doesn't, just

you go out after her. I wouldn't take too many chances in the

waiting game."


The German shook his head. His blue eyes swam with sentimental

moisture. "You do not understand," he said. "She went with

another—I must wait for her to come away. I have no address—so?"


"Well, that—that's different," stammered the young American. His

sympathy became cynical. Fishy business—but even a fishy business

has its human side. So presently he found himself gazing

interestedly upon the photograph the German displayed in the back of

his watch—the photograph of a decolleté young woman with

provocative dark eyes and parted lips and pearl-like teeth, and he

shook the caller's hand most heartily in parting, and prophesied,

with fine assurance, the successful end of this fishy romance.


"You have a heart, my friend," said the German solemnly, and lifting

hat and stick and lemon-colored gloves from the table, he bowed

profoundly in farewell.


"And to the Fräulein—you will give my so deep apology?" he added

earnestly, and Billy assured him that he would. And he found

himself, for all his pre-occupation with the vision of Arlee's

spring-like beauty, by no means displeased at the errand. A man must

have something to do while he is waiting—if he is to avoid last

bottles! He would seek her out that very afternoon.


But by afternoon he was tearing upstairs and downstairs through the

hotel after a very different quarry, which at last he ran to earth

at a tiny table behind a palm on the veranda. The quarry was further

protected by an enveloping newspaper, but Billy did not stand on

ceremony.


"I want to talk to you," said he.


Falconer looked up. He recognized Billy perfectly, though his gaze

gave no admission of that. This tall young fellow with the deep-set

gray eyes and the rugged chin and the straight black hair he first

remembered seeing dancing that Wednesday evening with Arlee—after

their own disastrous tea and its estrangement. Arlee had appeared on

mystifyingly good terms with him, though he was positive from his

own observations, and had corroboration from the Evershams, that she

had never spoken to him until five minutes before. Then the fellow

had fairly grilled the Evershams about the girl's whereabouts last

night. And he had learned that the previous afternoon he had managed

to take Claire's protection upon himself in the bazaars, actually

convincing her that she ought to feel indebted to him, and had

driven back with them.... An unabashed intruder, that fellow! He

ought to have a lesson.


His air of unwelcome deepened, if possible, as Billy helped himself

to a chair, drew it confidentially close to him and cast a careful

glance about the veranda.


"I don't want anyone to hear this," he explained.


Falconer smiled cynically. He had met confidential young Americans

before. There was nothing they could sell him.


"It's about Miss Beecher." Billy looked uncomfortable. He hesitated,

blushed boyishly through his tan, and blurted, "There's something

mighty queer about that departure of hers yesterday."


"Ah!"


"I don't feel right about it.... It's deuced queer. She isn't in

Alexandria."


"Ah!"


"If you say 'Ah' again, I hope you choke," said Billy violently to

himself. Aloud he continued, "I wired to the Khedivial and to all

the other hotels—there are just a few—and she isn't registered

there, and the Maynards are not, either."


"Possibly staying with friends," said Falconer indifferently. He

regarded his paper.


"Very few Americans have friends in Alexandria. However, that might

be so. But no ship has arrived from the Continent for three days,

and it seems mighty odd, if they were there three days ago, for them

to have wired at the last minute and had her tear off like that."


"I do not pretend to account for your compatriots," said the

sandy-haired young man.


Billy looked at him a minute. "There's no use in your being

disagreeable," he remarked. "I didn't thrust myself upon you because

I was attracted to you, at all. But I thought you were a sensible,

masculine human being who was interested in Miss Beecher's

whereabouts."


"I beg your pardon," said the other young man. "I am—I mean I am

interested—if you think there is anything really wrong. But I do

not see your point."


"Well, now, see if you can see this. I wired the consul there and

some other fellow at the port, and they wired back that no people of

the name of Maynard have arrived on any of the boats for the past

two weeks—that was as far back as they looked up. Now that's

queer."


"He could be mistaken—or they could have bought some one else's

accommodations—and that would account for the hastiness of their

plans," Falconer argued.


"But what train did she go on?"


"What train? Why, the express for Alexandria."


"That left at eight-thirty. Now why in the world would she rush away

in the middle of the afternoon, sending a telegram from the station

and leaving her packing undone, for an eight-thirty train?"


"Why I—I really can't say. She may have had errands——"


"Where did she have her dinner? Did she dine with friends at some of

the hotels? What friends has she here?"


"I really can't say as to that, either. I wasn't aware that she had

any."


"And where did she send that telegram from? There isn't a copy of

any such telegram at the offices I've been to—at Cook's or the

station. It might have been written on a telegraph blank and sent up

by messenger with the money—but why not come herself, with all that

time on her hands? And nobody remembers selling her any ticket to

Alexandria—and you know anybody would remember selling anything to

a girl like that."


Falconer was silent.


"And nobody at Cook's paid out any money on her letter of credit—or

cashed any express checks for her. Where did that money come from

that was sent back to the hotel?"


"But what is the point of all this?"


"That's what I just particularly don't know.... But it needs looking

into."


Falconer favored him with a level scrutiny. "How long have you known

Miss Beecher?"


"I met her the night before last. That, however, doesn't enter into

the case."


"It would seem to me that it might."


"Between three days and three weeks," said Billy, remembering

something, "the difference is sometimes no greater than between

Tweedledum and Tweedledee." He smiled humorously at the other young

man, a frank, likeable smile that softened magically the bluntness

of his young mouth. "That's why I came to you. You are the only soul

I know to be interested in Miss Beecher's welfare. The Evershams are

off up the Nile—and they'd probably be helpless, anyway. Besides,

you know more about this blamed Egypt of yours than I do.... Have

you any idea where she went yesterday afternoon?"


"Not at all."


"Neither have the Evershams. They were surprised when I asked them

about it this morning. They didn't know she was going. Now she went

somewhere in a limousine——"


"Probably to the station."


"American girls don't go to stations in floating white clothes and

hats all pink roses. I particularly remember the pink rose," said

Billy gloomily. "No, if she had been going to the station she would

have had on a little blue or gray suit, very up and down, and a

little minute of a hat with just one perky feather. And she'd have a

bag of sorts with her—no girl would rush away to Alexandria without

a bag."


"She could have sent it ahead of her or returned and dressed later

for the station."


"Why the mischief did I tramp off to those bazaars?" said the young

American. "But, see here—weren't you around the hotel after that

yesterday—at tea time?"


"Er—yes—I——"


"And weren't you rather looking out for Miss Beecher? Wouldn't you

have noticed if she had been coming or going?"


Falconer stroked his small mustache and shot a look at Billy out of

the corners of his eyes which expressed his distinct annoyance at

these intrusive demands.


"I don't remember to have met you," said he slowly.


"You haven't. I know your name, but you don't know mine. I am

William B. Hill."


"Ah—Behill."


"No—B. Hill. The B is an initial."


"Of what?" said the other casually, and Billy's cheeks grew suddenly

warm.


"Of my middle name," said he, with steady composure. "If we are to

do any team-work you will have to let it go at the William and the

Hill."


"What team-work do you suggest?"


"Find out where she went yesterday. Find out where she is now. What

worries me," he burst out, with ungovernable uneasiness, yet with a

hint of humor at his own extravagant imaginings, "is her talking to

that Turk fellow yesterday—that Captain Kerissen, I think she

called him. She had told me the night before that he was going to

get her some ball tickets or other, and I didn't think anything of

it, but yesterday I thought he had his nerve to come and call upon

her. You see, I passed through the hall and saw them talking. I went

out to the veranda and after he had gone I came in again, but she

was nowhere in sight. Then I went back to the veranda, and in a few

moments she came out, in white with a rose on her hat, and went off

in a car that was ready. Of course Kerissen wasn't in the car, and I

haven't any proof of his connection with the thing, but he might

easily have induced her to look at some mosque or other off the

'beaten track'——"


"But she returned, for later she sent that telegram from the

station," Falconer argued.


Billy was silent. Then he burst out, "But all the same there is a

mystery to this thing.... She—she's too confoundedly young and

pretty to run around alone in this painted jade of a city."


"This city has law and order—much more of them than there are in

your national hotbeds of robbery and murder."


"H'm—well, I don't hold any brief for Chicago—I suppose Chicago is

the target—so I won't defend that. But I've heard stories."


"Queer ones, I should say."


"Devilish queer ones!... How about that young Monkton or Monkhouse

who dropped out of things last winter?"


Falconer looked annoyed. "Oh, there are rumors——"


"Yes, rumors that he flirted with a Turkish lady—that he was on

horseback just outside her carriage during the jam at the

Kasr-el-Nil bridge, and they looked and smiled and afterwards met in

a shop. And rumors that she gave him a rendezvous at her home and

that he told another man about it at the club, who warned him

sharply, and he only laughed.... But it's no rumor that he

disappeared. He's gone, all right, and nobody knows where he went,

and nobody seems to want to know. Officially they said he was

drowned out swimming—or lost in a sandstorm riding in the

desert—or spiked on top of an obelisk or something equally

reasonable—but, privately, people say other things.... No

international law intrudes into the Turkish woman question."


"What of it?" Falconer looked stubborn. "I daresay the fellow

received his deserts.... But the case hardly applies—what?"


"Well—it makes one feel that anything can happen here—that the

city is quicksand where a chance step would engulf one." Billy

stared frowningly out on the vivid street ahead of him. A pretty

English bride and her soldier husband were out exercising their

dogs. Two ladies in a victoria were advertising their toilettes. A

blond baby toddled past with his black nurse. It was all very

peaceful and charming. It did not look like quicksand.... Into the

picture came a one-eyed man with a stuffed crocodile on his head,

stalking slowly along, scanning the veranda with his single,

penetrating eye, calling his wares in harsh gutturals, and with him

came suddenly the sense of that strange background before which all

this bright tourist life was played, that dark watching, secret

East, curious and incalculable.


Falconer folded his paper with a sharp crackle that recalled young

Hill's wandering thought. "That's all very well, but it doesn't

apply," he observed, with conviction.


"Then where is she?" Billy was bluntly belligerent.


The other put his paper in his pocket. "In Alexandria, to be sure,

and not at all pleased, either, to have you bring her name into such

questioning." He looked squarely at Billy as he said that, and the

eyes of the two young man met and exchanged a secret challenge of

hostility.


Billy rose. "Oh, all right," he returned. "I daresay I am as much a

fool as you take me for.... She may be all right. But if not—I

thought I'd give you a chance to take a hand in it."


"The sporting chance," said Falconer, with an appreciable smile.

"I'm much obliged—but I don't at all share your misgivings.... And

what in the world do you propose to do about it?"


For a minute Billy's gaze blankly interrogated the sunlit distances.

His eyes were fixed, but empty; his forehead knitted in an uncertain

frown. Then quite suddenly he turned and flashed at Falconer a look

of odd and unforeseen decision.


"I'm going to buy a crocodile," he imparted, with a wide, boyish

grin. "I'm going to buy a crocodile of a one-eyed man."


Stolidly Falconer eyed his departing back. Stolidly, definitely,

comprehensively, he pronounced judgment. "Mad," said he. "Mad as the

March Hare."


    CHAPTER VIII


    THE MIDNIGHT VISITOR


That stealthy touch brought Arlee half upright, shot with ghastly

alarms. Her heart stopped beating; it stood still in the cold clutch

of terror. The breath seemed to have left her body.


Once more she felt the hands gropingly upon her. It came from the

back side of her bed, reaching apparently from the very wall. And

then she heard a voice whispering, "Be still—I do not hurt you. Be

still."


It was a woman's voice, soft, sibilant, hushed, and the frozen grip

of fear was broken. She was trembling now uncontrollably.


"Who is there?"


"S-sh!" came the warning response, and then, her eyes staring into

the shadowy recess, she saw the curtains at the back side of the bed

were parting as a figure appeared between them.


"Give me a box, a book—somethings to put here in this lock,"

commanded the voice peremptorily, and in a daze Arlee found herself

extending a magazine across the bed toward the half-seen figure, who

turned and busied herself about the curtains a moment, then came

straight across the bed into the room beside Arlee.


"Now you see who I am," said the astonishing intruder calmly.


Mutely Arlee shook her head, seeing only a figure about her own

height clad in a dark negligée. Dumfounded she stood watching while

her visitor deliberately lighted a candle.


"So—that is better," she observed, and in the light of the tiny

taper between them the two stood facing each other.


Arlee saw a girl some years older than herself, a small, plump,

rounded creature, with a flaunting and insouciant prettiness. Her

eyes were dark and bright, her babyish lips were full and scarlet,

her nose was whimsically uptilted. Dark hair curled closely to the

vivid face and fell in ringlets over the white neck.


"You don't know me?" she said in astonishment at Arlee's eyes of

wonder. "He has not told you?" Incredulity, impertinent and mocking,

darted out of the dark eyes. "What you think then—you what got my

room?"


"Your room?" Arlee echoed faintly. She flung a quivering hand toward

the bed. "How did you get in here? I locked the door——"


"You see how I came—I came by the panel," She waited a moment,

watching the wide blue eyes before her, the parted lips, the white

cheeks in which the blood was slowly stealing back, and incredulity

gave way to astonished acceptance. "You don't know that, either?

That is very funny."


"Did you lock it?" was Arlee's next breathless question. "What was

that you said about putting in a magazine? Did you leave it open?"


The other girl reached quickly and caught her arm, as Arlee turned

toward the bed. "No, no, if it goes shut we cannot open it inside,"

she warned. "It does not open this side unless you have the key. It

opens from without. But he will not come in now—he is at the

Khedive's palace. We are all right."


"But I want to get away," cried Arlee. She turned upon this other

girl great eyes of pitiful entreaty, eyes where the dark shadows

about them lay like cruel bruises on the white flesh. "I must get

away at once. Won't you help me?"


"Help you? I would help myself, if I could. But there is no way out.

It is no use." The unknown girl spoke with a bitterness that brought

conviction. Piteously the flare of hope and spirit wilted.


"You are sure?" she questioned faintly. "There is no way out?"


"No way, no way!" The other shook her head impatiently. "Do I not

know? Let us talk of that again. Now I came to see you, to see what

pretty face had sent me packing!" She laughed, but there was

ugliness in the laughter, and catching up the candle she held it

before Arlee, her face impudently close, her eyes black darts of

curiosity.


"Well you are pretty enough," she said coolly. "Hamdi has always the

good taste. But do you think you will keep my room from me—h'm?"


"I do not want your room," said Arlee with passionate intensity.

"I do not want to stay here. I want only to go away. Oh, there must

be a way. Please help me—please." She choked and broke down, the

tears hot in her eyes.


''I do not want to stay here''


"'I do not want to stay here'"


The other girl abruptly drew her down on the couch and settled

herself beside her among the cushions. "Here—be comfortable—let us

be comfortable and talk," she said. "Do not cry so—What, you are so

soon sorry? You want to be off?"


Desperately Arlee steadied her shaking voice. "I must go at once."


"You got enough so soon?"


"Enough!" was the quivering echo.


"What you come for then?"


"Come for? I did not know what I was coming into. I thought—but

tell me," she broke off to demand, "tell me about the plague. Was

there any quarantine at all? How soon was it over? What is really

happening?"


"Quar—quar—what you mean?"


"The plague? Has there been a plague here? Have people had to stay

in the palace on account of it?"


"Oh—h!" The indrawn breath was eloquent of enlightenment. "Is that

somethings he said to you?"


"Yes, yes. Isn't it true? Wasn't there any plague?"


With eyes of dreadful apprehension she saw the other shake her head

in vigorous denial. "No plague," she said decisively. "My maid—she

know everything. No sickness here."


"Then it was all a lie." Arlee's eyes fixed themselves on the

dancing candle flame, swaying in the soft night air. She tried to

think very coolly and collectedly, but her brain felt numb and

fogged and heavy. The sight of that tortured candle flame hypnotized

her. Faintly she whispered, "Then it was all—an excuse," and, at

that, sharp terror, like a knife, cleaved her numbness. She turned

furiously to her visitor.


"But he would not dare make it all up!"


She saw the callousness of the shrug. "Why not—he is the master

here!" Her own heart echoed fearfully the words. She stammered,

"But—but I wrote—I had a letter—there must——"


"What in all the world are you saying?" demanded the other. "What is

this story?" and as Arlee began the quick, whispered narration she

listened intently, her little dark head on one side, nodding wisely

at intervals.


"So—you came to have tea," she repeated at the close, in her

quaintly inflected, foreign-sounding English. "And you stay because

of the plague? So?"


"But I wrote—I wrote to my friends and——"


"And gave him the letters!"


"But I had a letter from my friends—or a telegram rather." Arlee

knitted her brows in furious thought. "And it sounded like her."


"Does he know her, that friend?" questioned the other and at Arlee's

nod, "Then he could write it himself—that is easy on telegraph

paper. He is so clever, that devil, Hamdi."


"But my friends knew where I was going"—slowly the mind turned back

to trace the blind, careless steps of that afternoon. "At least he

said he'd leave a note—Oh, what a fool I was!" she broke off to

gasp, seeing how that forethought of his, that far-sighted remark,

had prevented her from leaving a note of her own. And she remembered

now, with flashing clearness, that upon her arrival he had

carelessly inquired if she, too, had left a note of explanation. How

lightly she had told him no! And what unguessed springs of action

came perhaps from that single word! For so cleverly had the trap

been swiftly prepared that if anything had gone wrong, if anyone had

become aware of her intentions, it could have passed off as a visit

and she would have returned to her hotel prattling joyously of her

wonderful glimpse into the seclusion of Turkish aristocracy!


"But the soldier with the bayonet," she said aloud. "There was one

on the stairs."


"A servant."


"Oh, if I had passed him!"


"You could not—he would run you through on a nod from Hamdi. They

watch that stairs always—day and night."


Day and night—and she was alone here, in this grim palace, alone

and helpless and forsaken.... What were her friends thinking about

her? Where did they think she was? Her thoughts beat desperately

upon that problem, trying to find there some ray of hope, some

promise that there were clues which would lead them to her, but she

found nothing there but deeper mystery and fearful surmise. He was

clever enough to cover his traces. No one had known of his

connection with her departure.... Perhaps he had sent them some

false and misleading message like the one he had sent her.... What

were they thinking? What did they believe? This was Friday night,

and she had been gone since Thursday afternoon.


In that moment she saw with merciless clarity the bitter straits

that she was in.


"Oh, he is a devil!" her companion was reaffirming with an angry

little half-whisper sibilant with fury. "Look how he treat me—me,

Fritzi Baroff! You do not know me? You do not know that name? In

Vienna it is not so unknown—Oh, God, I was so happy in Vienna!" She

stopped, her breast heaving, with the flare of emotion, then went on

quickly, with suppressed vehemence, "I was a singer—in the light

opera. I dance, too, and I was arriving. Only this year I was to

have a fine rôle—and it all went, zut, it all went for that man! I

was one fool about him, and his dark eyes and his strange ways.... I

thought I had a prince. And he worship me then, too—he follow me,

he give me big diamonds.... So he take me here—it was to be the

vacation!"


She gave a strangling little laugh. Arlee was listening with a

painful intensity. She was living, she thought, in an Arabian

nights.


"I stay at the hotel first till he make this like a private

apartment for me," went on the little dancer, "and when I come here

he do everything for me. I have luxury, yes, jewels and dresses and

a fine new car. Then, by and by, I grow tired. It was always the

same and he was at the palace, much. And he would not let me make

acquaintance. We quarrel, but still I have a fancy for him, and

then, you understand, money is not always so easy to find. Life can

be hard. But I get more restless, I want to go back on the stage and

I, well, I write some letters that he finds out. Bang, goes the

door upon me! He laugh like a fiend. He say that I am to be a little

Turkish lady to the end of my life. Oh, God, he shut me up like a

prisoner in this place, and I can do nothing—nothing—nothing!"


She beat out angry emphasis on the palm of one hand with a clenched

little fist. "I go nearly mad. I lose my head. He laugh—he is like

that. He is a devil when he turns against you, and, you understand,

he had somethings new to play with now.... Sometimes he seem to love

me as before, and then I would grow soft and coax that he take me to

Europe some day, and then when I think he mean it—Oh, how he

laugh!" She drew in her breath sharply. "Sometimes I think he will

take me again—sometime—but I cannot tell. And the days never end.

They are terrible. My youth is going, going. And my youth is all I

have."


She looked at Arlee with eyes where her terror was visible, and all

the lines of her pretty, common little face were changed and

sharpened, and her babyish lips dragged down strangely at the

corners.


A surge of pity went through Arlee Beecher. "Oh, you will escape,"

she heard herself saying eagerly. "And I will escape—or—or——"


"Or?"


"Or I will kill myself," she whispered quiveringly.


The little Viennese stared hard at her, and a sudden crinkle of

amusement darted across the bright shallows of her eyes. "Come,

love is not so bad," she said, "and Hamdi can be charming." Then as

she saw a shudder run through the young girl before her, "Oh, if you

do not fancy him!" she cried airily, yet with a keen look.


But Arlee's two hands sought and covered up the scarlet shame in her

face. She did not cry; she felt that every tear in her was dried in

that bitter flame. Her whole body seemed on fire, burning with fury

and revulsion and that awful sense of humiliation.


The other stirred restively, "Come, do not cry—I hate people to

cry. It makes everything so worse. And do not talk of killing. It is

not so easy anyway, that killing. Do I not think I will die and end

all when my rage is hot—but how? How? I cannot beat my head out

against the wall like a Russian. I cannot stick a penknife in my

throat or eat glass. To do that one must be a monster of courage.

And I have no poison to eat, no gas to turn on.... Then the mood

goes and the day is bright and I look in the glass and say, 'Die?

Die for you? Kill all this beautiful young thing that has such joy

to dance and sing? Never! Some day I will be out of this and laugh

at the memory of such blackness.' And so I practice my voice and my

steps—and I wait my chance. When you came, yesterday, first I was

furious to be pushed out, then I think it is the chance, maybe. I

think you would be glad to help me to get out and not to stay to

make you jealous. But if you are also in the trap——" Her voice

fell dispiritedly. She drew a long, weary breath.


"But I shall not stay in the trap." Arlee spoke with desperate

resolve, her eyes on the sputtering candle, her palms against her

burning cheeks, her finger tips pressed into her throbbing temples.

"I shall not let him make me afraid like this. He must know he will

be found out—he cannot play like this with an American girl! I

shall face him to-morrow. I shall demand my freedom. I shall tell

him that I did tell people at the hotel—that he will be discovered.

I will make him afraid!"


"You cannot. He watches what happens on the outside—he knows."


After a pause, "Oh, why did I come!" said Arlee in choking

bitterness.


The little dancer turned, and, sitting there cross-legged on the

couch like a squat little idol, her chin sunk in her palm, her dark

eyes staring unwinkingly at Arlee, gave the girl a long, strange

scrutiny.


"You do not like him?" she said.


"I hate him!"


"But you came to tea?"


"To meet his sister. To see the palace."


"His sister? Did he show you one?"


"Yes—a woman with red hair. A Turkish woman. She spoke French to

me."


"Ah—that would be Seniha!"


"Seniha? I don't know. She played the piano. Has he more than one

sister?"


But as she put the question a sudden flash of intuition forestalled

the dancer's mocking cry of "Sister!" And as Fritzi hurried on, "He

has no sister—not here, anyway," Arlee's thoughts ran back to the

beginning of that very evening which seemed so long ago when she had

plunged wildly into those unknown rooms, and saw again that

painted, jeweled woman with her outstretched arms.


"She is his wife," the Viennese was saying.


"I—I did not know that he was married."


"Oh, Turkish marriages." The other shrugged, with a contempt a

trifle droll in one who had dispensed with every ceremony. "She was

his second. The first was a little girl, he said. The match was made

for him. She is dead. This Seniha was her cousin, a cousin who was

divorced and she lived with the wife. And our pretty Hamdi made love

to her, and she was mad about him and so, presently, it happens that

he must marry her, for it would be terrible to have disgrace upon

the wife's family. Besides the first wife had no children. So he

married her. But she had no children. It was all one fairy story."

Fritzi laughed under her breath in great enjoyment. "So Hamdi was

cheated and he has been a devil to her. The first little wife dies

and he shut the second up here, teasing her sometimes, sometimes

making love when he is dull, but forcing her to his will for fear he

will divorce her.... How she must have hated you, when she had to

play that sister. Except that she was glad that I was being put

aside," the dancer added with quick spite. "I think she would put

poison in my meat if she did not fear Hamdi so.... And always she

hopes that he will come back to her. I have seen her waiting, night

after night——"


And Arlee thought of the jewels and the silks ... and the long,

long, silent hours.... Slowly she put out her hand and snuffed out

the smoking wick, then raised her eyes to where the painted bars

stretched black across the starry square of sky. "Won't she

help?" she asked.


"Not she! Hamdi would find her out.... Not through her can you get

word to your friends. For you have friends here? And they will help

you? And then you will help me?"


"Oh, yes, if I can get help," promised Arlee. "But I am afraid my

friends have gone up the Nile—and there are just—just one or two

left in Cairo that would help. And I must get word to them at

once. What is the best way? Couldn't I push a note through the

windows on the street? Someone might see that!"


"Yes, the doorkeeper. No, that is not safe.... If only that girl

were sure——"


"Mariayah?" cried Arlee.


"No, the other—the little one with the wart over her eye. Have you

seen her? Well, watch for her, then. She has an itching palm—she

may help. But only in little things, of course, for she is afraid.

And I have no money left and she is afraid to take a jewel."


"I have almost no money," said Arlee blankly. "Only a letter of

credit——"


"A letter of nothing here! But promise her your friends will give

much."


"Would she mail a letter?"


"Have you stamps? No? She is so ignorant that is an obstacle. And

the post is distant and she dare not go far. But sometimes the baker

sends a little boy, and if you had money to give she might get a

note to him to carry—though, maybe, she burns the note and keeps

the money," the Viennese ended pessimistically.


"But I must get help at once," Arlee iterated passionately.

Before——"


"Before?" the other repeated curiously, "He makes love to you—h'm?"


"He—is beginning."


"Only beginning?"


"Only—beginning." Arlee felt the girl's strange, hard scrutiny

through the dark. Then she heard her draw a quick breath as if her

eyes on Arlee's flower-like face had convinced her of something

against all her sorry little reason.


"Well, that is good then," she said. "Try to keep him off. What does

he promise you?"


"Promise me? He does not promise anything."


"But he must say something—what is between you—what?" demanded the

other impatiently.


Briefly, her shamed cheeks grateful for the shadows, Arlee told of

that walk in the garden, of the flowers and the letter, the scene

after dinner. And the other girl's eyes grew wider and wider, and

then finally she burst into a smothered little laugh.


"Oh, he is mad, that Hamdi!" she whispered. "He is a monster of

vanity—'conquest of the spirit'—h'm, I comprehend. That young man

has a pride beyond all sense. You dazzle him—he is in love again

like a boy. And he must dazzle you. His pride demands a victory not

of force alone.... Some men are like that.... Well, that is your

chance!"


"My chance?"


"Play with his vanity—fight his force with that!" said this strange

initiator into terrible secrets. "He will believe anything of his

fascinations—I know him. And if he is so mad for you that he dares

all this trouble to have you here, then he is so mad that you can

fool him and make him hold back in hopes to gain more from you. Make

him think you are coming, as he wishes, heart and body, but still

you would wait a little. So you gain time.... Oh, you must be

careful! If he loses hope, if you anger him, why the game is over.

But if you are careful you can gain a few days——"


"A few days," said Arlee in a tense little voice.


"Well, that is something—since you hate him so!"


"Yes, that is something." Arlee drew a shivering breath, her head

drooping, her lashes on her cheeks. Then suddenly, amazingly, her

chin came pluckily up, her soft lips set with desperate decision,

her eyes turned on her counselor a look of flashing spirit. She was

like some young wild thing at bay, harried, defiant, tensely

defensive. Something of the pathos of her innocent presence there,

in that evil palace, utterly alone, hopelessly defiant, penetrated

for an instant the callous acceptances of the little dancer and her

eyes softened with facile sympathy, but the impression dulled, and

she only nodded her head encouragingly.


"Good! That is the way! Women can always act!" she murmured,

slipping off the divan and drawing her fluttering robes about her.

"But it is very late and I must go—it is not safe to stay so."


"Where is your room? Could I get to you?"


"No—for you cannot open that panel on the inside—unless you can

steal the key from him as I could not! My room—for this present,

little one," and her eyes laughed suddenly in challenge, "is up on

the top—a little old room all alone. My doors are locked, but there

is a panel in my room, too, a panel at the top of tiny stairs, and

the lock on that panel is so old and rusty that a knife make it

open. So I pushed it open and came down the tiny stairs that end out

there in the passage way, and I opened your panel. Now I must steal

back, but I shall come again, and we must plan."


"But where does this secret passage go?" Arlee had followed over the

bed, and held aside the heavy draperies while the little Baroff was

pushing the panel softly and carefully open. Eagerly Arlee peered

out into the darkness beyond. "Where does it go?" she repeated.


"It runs above the hall of banquets and into the selamlik,"

whispered the Viennese. "It opens into Hamdi's rooms, he says, and I

know that a servant sleeps always at his door and another is at the

foot of the stairs. So it would be madness to try that way."


But Arlee stared thoughtfully into the secret place. "I am glad I

know," she said.


"Well, good-by, little one." The Viennese was standing outside now,

softly closing the door. For a moment her face remained in the

opening. "You will not tell Hamdi that I came—no?" she demanded

sharply, and then on Arlee's quick reassurance she nodded, whispered

good-by again, and drew back her little face.


The wall rolled into place and a gentle click told of the caught

lock. The curtains fell back over the wall. And Arlee was left

huddling there alone, feeling that it had all been a dream, but for

the heavy scent that lingered in the air and the wild fear beating

in her heart.


    CHAPTER IX


    A DESPERATE GAME


Very slowly the black night grayed down into a wan, spectral

morning, and slowly the gray morning paled into a dim

mother-of-pearl dawn. And then suddenly the mother-of-pearliness

brightened into a shimmering opal, and the ray of pale gold light

slanted through the barred window and the bright face of new day

peeped over the sill, staring out of countenance the lurking shadows

of the night.


And then Arlee's eyes closed, and the heart which had been beating

like a frightened rabbit's at every sound and shadow steadied into a

rhythm as regular as a clock. She slept like a tired baby; while the

light grew brighter and higher, and reached in over the shining

dressing table, over the white piano, to rest upon the oblivious

face upon the couch and to play with the bright, tangled hair.


The first knocking upon the door did not disturb that sleep, and it

was a long time before the knock was again sounded. Then Arlee heard

and sprang to her feet in a lightning rush of consciousness. It was

Mariayah again, and the water jars which already looked familiar to

her, and after the water jars appeared more roses and with the roses

a letter.


Those roses came, the letter explained, to droop their heads before

her loveliness, which put theirs to shame. They would greet her as

humbler sisters greet a fairer. For they were roses of a day, but

she was the Rose of Life. The capitals were Kerissen's own. And then

abruptly the letter demanded:


      Did I frighten you last night? Is it so strange to you

      that you have magic to make a man forget all the barriers

      of your convention? Do you not know you have an

      enchantment which distills in the blood and changes it to

      wine? You are the Rose of Life, the Rose of Desire, and

      no man can look upon you without longing. But you must

      not be angry at me for that, for I am your slave, and

      would strew roses always to soften the world for your

      little feet.... Fortune has made you my guest. Will you

      not smile upon me while Fortune smiles? Luncheon will be

      in the garden, for it is cool and fresh today.


The mask was slipping. Only a flimsy veil of sentiment now over his

rash will. Only a light pretense of her freedom, of his courtesy. He

was beginning to declare himself....


But she must not let him suspect that she knew. She must not.


Her spirit responded fiercely to this tense demand upon it. The

dread, the panic of the night was gone. The fear that had shaken her

was beaten down like a cowardly dog. Excitement burned in her blood.

Everything depended upon her coolness and her wit, upon a look,

perhaps, the turn of a phrase, the droop of an eye, and she was

passionately resolved that neither coolness nor wit should fail her,

nor words nor looks nor eyes betray the heart of her. She would play

her rôle with every breath she drew.


She crossed the room at the luncheon summons in the nervous tensity

of mood that an actress might go to play a part in which her career

would live or die. Every half hour with Kerissen was now a duel,

every minute was a stroke to be parried, and she flung herself into

that duel with the desperate exhilaration of such daring. Her hands

were icy, and her cheeks were flaming with the excitement which

consumed her, but she revealed no other trace of it, and she

wondered to herself at the inscrutable fairness of the face which,

looked back at her from the glass.


None of the record of those frightened, sleepless hours was written

there, none of her furious pride, her fixed intensity. Only the soft

shadows under the blue eyes gave her face a look of added delicacy

for all the unnatural flare of brilliant color, and a faint

wistfulness in those eyes seemed to overlay the smiles she

practiced, like a cloud shadow on a brook. And never, never, in all

her glad, care-free days, had she been as distractingly pretty as

she was that moment. With an angry little pang she recognized it,

pinning on the lace hat with its enchanting rose, and then

desperately she resolved to employ it and added two of Kerissen's

pink roses to the costume.


She thought the scene was very like a stage, when she came out

through the narrow door which the old woman unlocked from a key she

carried on a girdle, and slowly descended the stone steps. Beneath

the wide-spreading lebbek a low table was laid for luncheon with two

wicker chairs beside it. The green of the fresh turf was as vivid as

stage grass; the lilies loomed unreally large and white; the

poinsettias flaunted like red paper flowers behind the vivid picture

that the Captain made in a dazzling buff and green uniform picked

out with gold. His bow was theatric, so was the deep look of

exaggerated admiration he bent upon her—it was strange to remember

that her danger was not theatric also. But that was deadly real, and

real, too, was the sudden surge of color into the young man's sallow

face.


"You are kind to my roses—if not to me," he said quickly, and held

out his hand for the brief little clasp she accorded.


"Your roses are dumb and have said nothing to make me cross," she

laughed lightly, and looked swiftly about her. "How lovely this is,"

she ran on, "and how charming to feel a breeze. That room is rather

warm and close.... Is you sister still too ill to come?"


And scarcely waiting for the assent which he began to frame with his

searching eyes upon her, she added, "I am afraid I made her angry

last night by intruding upon her. But I heard her voice and ran back

to her room to ask after her. She wouldn't let me stay at all."


It was droll how natural her voice sounded, she thought. His eyes

held their fixed scrutiny in an instant, then dropped carelessly

away, as he drew forward the wicker chairs. "She is a nerveuse,

you understand," he said with an air of indolent resignation, "and

one can do nothing for that sort of thing. A crisis comes—one must

wait for it to pass.... She regrets that condition.... And she

wished me to present her regrets to you," he added suavely, "for

that reception of you last night. She was ill and did not expect

you—and she did not wish you to see her in that condition."


"I should not have gone," acknowledged Arlee, "but, as I said, I

heard voices from the ante-room and thought I would like to see

her.... That pretty little maid she gave me does not speak any

English, so I cannot send any messages."


"But you can write them."


"My French spelling is worse than my pronunciation!" She laughed

amusedly. "I wish you would find me an interpreter to put my polite

remarks into polite sounding phrases. I know I put things like a

First Reader!"


He smiled. "You do not put them like a First Reader to me. We do

not need an interpreter.... Unless I need one to speak to you?"


"Oh, no, your English is wonderful!" She waited an instant, then

took a breathless plunge. "Have you any more news for me?" she

demanded, forcing the note of expectancy. It would be suspicious,

indeed, if she did not ask that. But what if he had decided to throw

the pretense aside——


"Not one word of news more," he said slowly.


She felt him watching her as she looked down on her plate. The

pretty little girl was passing a platter of pigeon: Arlee did not

speak until she had helped herself, then she said in a voice touched

faintly with chagrin, "Well, the English are not very gallant toward

ladies in misfortune, are they? I feel furiously snubbed.... Of

course Mrs. Eversham never was much of a writer, but they might send

over my letters from the hotel. The last mail ought to have brought

a lot from that big brother of mine."


"Ah, yes, that big, grown-up, married brother who is so satisfied

with all you do!"


She felt she had been unfortunate in her rash confidences.


"He won't be so pleased when he learns how I wasted a perfectly good

Nile ticket," she remarked. "And Big Brother is rather fierce when

he isn't pleased."


His eyes smiled, as if he understood and despised her suggestion.

"Cairo and your America are not so near," he observed negligently,

"that an incident here is a matter of immediate knowledge there."


She felt the danger of seeming to threaten him. "Oh, I'd 'fess up,"

she said lightly, playing with her food. "There—shoo—go away!" she

cried suddenly, with a militant gesture about her plate. "That's one

thing I hate about Egypt—the flies!"


"I hope that is the only thing you hate," said the young man

blandly.


"Isn't that enough? There are so many of them!"


He laughed with real amusement at her petulance. "Is there netting

enough in your room?" he inquired. "Would you like more for your

bed?"


"Oh, no, I'm all right, thank you. The flies are chiefly bothersome

at meals. This is certainly their paradise."


"But is there anything you would like—to make you happy here? I

will get it for you. Would you not like some books, some music, some

new clothes——"


"I don't wonder you ask! But really this white gown will last a

little longer—Cairo is so clean. No, thank you, there is nothing I

need bother you about—Oh, yes, there really is one book that I

would like—a Turkish or an Arabic dictionary. I have always meant

to learn a little of the language and this would seem the

opportunity."


In the pause in which he appeared to be consuming pigeon she could

feel him weighing her request, foreseeing its results.


"I shall be most happy to teach you," was what he said, but she knew

she would never have that dictionary. And so one plan of the morning

went flying to the winds. But she snatched at the next opening she

saw and plunged into interested questions about the Turkish

language, asking the words for such things as seemed spontaneously

to occur to her—wall, palace, table—numbers—days of the

week—repeating the pronunciation with the earnestness of a diligent

young pupil, until she felt that her memory had all it could hold.

And distrust, always ready now like a prompter in the box, suggested

most upsettingly that perhaps he was not giving the right words. She

resolved to experiment upon Mariayah.


He reverted, with increasing emphasis, upon his desire to make her

happy in the palace, to surround her with whatever she desired, and

swiftly she availed herself of this second opening.


"Yes, indeed, there is something that would make me happier, if you

don't mind, please," she added with a droll assumption of meekness.

"You don't know how horrid it is for me to be caged in one room and

not be out of doors, and I would love to come down into the garden

when I want to. Won't you give me a key to that door? That is, if it

is always locked."


"Generally it is not," he said readily, "but now with the soldiers

about it is safer. You see, the soldiers can approach the garden

through the open banquet hall"—and he nodded to the colonnade

behind them—"and though it is forbidden, one cannot foretell their

obedience."


To one who knew those soldiers were chimerical acquiescence was

maddening.


"But, dear me, can't you have some one in the banquet hall to shoo

the soldiers away?" Arlee argued persuasively. "Since the rest of

the household has the court, it seems awfully selfish not to let the

ladies have the garden for their airing."


"It may be managed," he assented. "It has always been done, for the

garden is for the ladies. Whenever you wish to be in the garden you

have but to send word, and the household will remain in the court,

as is, indeed, the custom."


"It would not be so terrible, you know, if a gardener or a

donkey-boy did see my face!" laughed Arlee. "Plenty of them have had

that pleasure before this."


She saw that the young man's face changed. Every clear-cut line of

it was sharp with repugnance. "You need not remind me of that," he

said with muffled fierceness, staring down at his plate.


"The danger line!" she thought while shaking her head at him, with

the tense semblance of an amused little smile.... "You aren't the

least bit English," she rebuked, "and I thought you were."


"Not in that.... And some day England will see her folly."


"America is seeing her folly now," thought Arlee with secret

bitterness. But when she raised her eyes they were gently

contemplative. She spoke musingly.


"In things like that you aren't at all what I thought you

were—about our social customs, I mean. Yet fundamentally, I think

you are."


"That I am what?"


"What I thought you were."


He waited, palpably waited, but Arlee continued to peel a tangerine

with absorption, and the question had to come from him. He put it

with an air of indolent amusement, yet she felt the intent interest

in leash.


"And what did you think I was like, chère petite mademoiselle?"


"Very handsome for one thing, Monsieur! You see, I owe you a

compliment for calling me such a pretty name as this!" With a

mischievous smile she touched the roses nodding in her girdle. "And

very autocratic for another, with a very bad temper. If you can't

get your way you would be shockingly disagreeable!"


"But I always get my way," he assured her lazily, his teeth showing

under his small, black mustache.


"I believe you do!" Ingenuous admiration, simple and sustained, was

in the look she gave him. Her hands were not half so icy now, nor

her nerves so tense. She felt strangely surer of herself; the actual

presence of the danger calmed her. She must make good with this, she

thought simply, in strenuous American.


"And yet," she went on thoughtfully, the pretty picture of

fascinated absorption in this most feminine topic—the dissection of

a young man—"yet, you are chivalrous. And I think that is the

quality we American girls admire most of all."


"The quality—of indulgence?" he questioned, with a half-railing

air.


"The quality—of gentleness."


"But is there not another quality which you American girls would

admire more than that gentleness—if you ever had the chance in your

lives to see it? The quality of dominance? The courage of the man

who dares what he desires, and who takes what he wills? Is not

that——"


"Ah, yes, we love strong men," Arlee flung into the speech that was

bearing him on like a tide, "but we don't think them strong unless

they are strong enough to fight themselves. They may take what they

will—but they mustn't crush it.... There is a gentleness in great

strength—I can't explain what I mean——"


"Ah, I see, I see." He smiled subtly. "I am not to crush you, little

Rose of Desire," he said softly.


She met the sly significance of his gaze with a look of frank,

unfaltering candor. "Of course not," she said stoutly. "When

you—you make me afraid of you, you make me like you less. You seem

less like the friend I knew on the boat."


"Ah, that boat!... You were my friend, then!" he added suddenly,

with a note of question sounding through the affirmation, and she

answered quickly, looking away with an air of petulant reproach.

"Why, you know I was, Captain Kerissen. And here in Cairo——"


"Yes, here in Cairo," he interrupted triumphantly, "in the face of

those eyes and tongues—I saw that red-headed dog of an Englishman

looking his anger at you! But you smiled on me before them

all—those fools, those tyrannic fools——"


"But you mustn't abuse my other friends! They were only—stupid!"


"Stupid as their blood brother, the ox!... But they are not in the

picture now—those other friends!" Disagreeably he laughed. "And you

do not grieve for them—no? The world has not touched you? There is

no one out there,"—he made a gesture over the guarding walls—"no

one who holds a fragment of your thought, of your heart in his

hands?"


She looked at him as if puzzled, then burst into a bubbling laugh.

"Why, of course not! I've just had a nice time with people. There

has never been a bit of sentiment about it!"


"Not on your side," he said meaningly, and because this was hitting

the truth smartly on the head she looked past him in some confusion.


"Oh—boys!" she said with a deprecating little laugh. "I've never

listened to them."


He leaned back in his chair, feeling for his cigarette case, and

the contentment of his look deepened. "You have been a child, asleep

to life," he murmured complacently. "I told you you were a

princess—let us say a sleeping princess waiting for the prince,

like that old fairy tale of the English." He was looking at his

cigarette as he tapped it on the arm of his chair, and slowly struck

a light, then, after the first breath, "But do you not hear his

footsteps in your sleep?" he added, and gave her a glance from the

corner of his eyes.


She looked up and then down; she stared out into the sun-flooded

garden and laughed softly. "Even princesses dream," she demurely

acknowledged, and thought the line and her fleet, meaning glance

went very well with this mad opera-bouffe which fate was forcing her

to play.


Kerissen seemed to think that went very well, too, for his flashing

teeth acknowledged his pleasure in her aptness; then his smile faded

and she felt him studying her over his cigarette, studying her

averted gaze, the bright color in her cheeks, the curves of her

lips, and he was puzzled and perturbed by the sweet, baffling beauty

of her. A wild elation began to swell his heart. His eyes glowed,

his blood burned with the triumph, not so much of his daring capture

of her, but of the flattering tribute that her pretty ways were

paying toward his personality alone. Wary as he was, cynical of

subterfuge, he did not penetrate her guard. His monstrous vanity

whispered eager flattery in his ears.


And still he continued to stare at her, finding her unbelievably

lovely. "My grandfather would call you an houri from paradise,"

he told her, the warmth of admiration deepening in his eyes.


"And your grandfather's grandson knows that I am only an houri

from America!... But that is paradise for houris!"


"And not for men, no!... Sometimes I have wished that those English

would restore in me that young belief in the heaven of the Prophet,"

he continued, smiling, "and now that wish is granted. It is here,

that paradise," and his smile, flashing about the lonely garden,

came to dwell again upon the girl before him.


She laughed. "But does one houri make a paradise?" she bantered,

while the beating, hurrying heart of her went faster and faster till

she thought his ears would hear it. "We have a proverb—one swallow

does not make a summer."


"Cela dépend—that depends upon the houri.... When you are

that one it is paradise indeed." He leaned toward her, speaking

softly, but with a voice that thrilled more and more in its own

eloquence.


She was the Rose of Desire, he reminded her, and beside her all

other flowers drooped in envy. She was as lovely as young Dawn to

the eyes of men. She was the ravishing embodiment of gaiety and

youth and delight. He quoted from the poets, not from his own

Oriental poets, but snatches from Campion and Wilde, vowing that


          "There was a garden in her face,

          Where roses and white lilies grow,"


and adding, with points of fire dancing in his heavy lidded eyes,


1


          "Her neck is like white melilote,

          Flushing for pleasure of the sun,"


and went on to add praise to praise and extravagance to

extravagance, till a sudden little imp of mirth caught Arlee by the

throat, hysterically choking her. "I shall never like praise or

poetry or—or men again," she thought, struggling between wild

laughter and hot disgust, while aloud she mocked, "Ah, you know too

much poetry, Captain Kerissen! I do not recognize myself at all! You

are laughing at me!"


"Laughing at you?... I am worshipping you," he said tensely, his

eyes on hers, and the fierce words shattered her light defenses to

confusion.


Silence gripped her. She tried to meet his look and smile in mock

reproof, but her eyes fled away affrighted, so full of desperate,

passionate things was the dark gaze they touched. She gripped her

cold little hands in her lap and looked out beyond the lebbek's

shade into the vivid garden. The hot sunshine lay orange on the

white-sanded paths; the shadows were purple and indigo. A little

lizard had come out from a crack in a stone and was sunning himself,

while one bright eye upon them, fixed, motionless, irridescent,

warned him of their least stir. She envied him the safety of his

crack.... She herself must meet this crisis—must turn this tide....


"It is—so soon," she faltered.


"Soon?" He had risen and was standing over her. "Soon? I was with

you on the boat—I walked by your side—I danced with you and held

you against my heart. And here in Cairo I walked and talked with

you.... And now for three days you have been under my roof, eating

at the table with me, alone within these walls, and you call it

soon! Truly, you are beyond belief! Soon!"


"But soon—for me!" she interrupted swiftly, and sprang to her

feet to face him with eyes and lips that smiled without a trace of

fear. Only her cheeks were no longer crimson but white as chalk.

"Too soon—for me to be sure—how I feel! I hadn't realized—I

hadn't known—Oh, you mustn't hurry me! You mustn't hurry me!" She

broke off in a confusion he might well misconstrue, and moved

nervously away, her back to him.


He stood staring after her, a man not in two minds but in three and

four. Her broken words—her smiles—her emotion—these might well

arouse the most flattering surmise, and his vanity and his curiosity

were stirred to swift delight. He broke into a storm of words, of

protestations, of eager persuasion and honied flattery, drawing

nearer and nearer to her, while she slipped continually away from

him.


"You mustn't hurry me," she echoed defensively. "I am not like

you—you Southerners. I——"


"You are asleep—I have told you that you are that sleeping

princess," he broke in, and following after as she turned away from

him, he put a quick arm about her, and bending over her, tried to

turn her about toward him. "Do you know how that little sleeping

princess was awakened by her prince?" he murmured fatuously,

bending closer.


The hat saved her, that coquettish little hat with its jealously

guarding brim which bent obstinately lower and lower between them.

And in the instant of his indecision, while he waited for the

surrender his vanity expected before exerting the force that would

conquer brutally, she broke unexpectedly from his clasp and darted a

few steps away from him, whirling about to face him with her head

flung back, her eyes on fire, her lips parted in a breathless

excitement.


"Captain Kerissen," she cried, and there was a ring of gaiety in her

voice, "do I understand that you are proposing to me?"


Very formally he bowed, a bow that hid the astonishment and the

cynical humor which zigzagged across his handsome face. "I am doing

myself that honor," he most suavely returned, and eyed her with an

astonished curiosity that checked his passion.


"Really?... So soon?" she cried very childishly, and again he bowed.

But this time she caught his smile.


"Really so soon, little Arlee."


To his amazement she burst into prankish laughter.


"Oh, you are romantic!" she gave back. "And if I can believe you

truly in earnest—last night I was furious at you," she went on

rapidly, interrupting the speech forming on his lips, "for I thought

you a dreadful flirt, just taking advantage of my being here, and

yet—and yet you didn't seem that kind. You seemed a gentleman!

And now if you really mean—all you are saying—but you can't, you

can't! I know your words are running ahead of you!"


"My words—let my heart speak—I——"


"But I don't know whether I ought to listen or not!" she burst out,

and with great naïveté, "I'm afraid it would be very silly to let

myself care for you."


"Silly? An adorable silliness! Could you not be happy with me here

in this palace? You would be a princess, indeed, a queen of my

heart. I would put every luxury at your command." In mingled

eagerness and wariness he watched her, incredulous of her assenting

mood, but with a hope that lured him on to believe. And in his eyes,

dubious, desirous, calculating, watchful, she read the fluctuations

of his thought. If afterwards there should happen to be any trouble

about this affair, how wonderfully it would smooth things to have

the girl infatuated with him, to show that she had been a party to

the intrigue! And how spicily it sweetened the taste of success to

his lips!


He had caught her two hands in his, and clasping them tightly he

bent forward, trying to scan the changes in her hesitating look,

while his words poured forth in a stream of praise and promise. She

would live like a little princess. His love and his wealth were at

her feet. Other women were eager for him, but he was hers alone. She

would adore Egypt, the Egypt that he would reveal to her, and when

she wearied they would go to the Continent and live always as she

desired. Only she must be kind to him, be kind and sweet and lift

her eyes and tell him that she would make him happy. She must not

keep him waiting. He was not a man with whom one amused oneself.


"And I am not a girl whom one commands!" she gave back with a flash

of spirit and a childish toss of her head. "I like you, Monsieur, at

least I did like you before you hurt my fingers so horribly"—the

tight grasp on her hands relaxed and she drew them swiftly away,

rubbing them in mock ruefulness—"and I could like you better and

better—perhaps"—her blue eyes flashed a look into his—"if you

were very nice and polite and give me time to catch my breath! You

are such a hurrying sort of person!" Her whimsical little smile

enchanted him, even while he chafed at such delay.


"I am mad about you," he said in a low tone.


"And only me?" she laughed, her dimples showing.


So, teasing and luring, she held him off, and her heart beat

exultantly as she saw that she had given him the thought of marriage

for that of conquest, the dream of a perfect idyll for that of an

enforced submission.... It was a desperate play, but she played it

valiantly, and her fearfulness and the spell of her beauty sweetened

the rôle of beseeching suitor for him, and gave a glamour to this

pretty garden dalliance.... The memory of time came to him at last

with a start, and frowningly he stared at the watch he drew out to

consult.


"I must hurry away—to another part of the palace," he amended

swiftly, "where I have an engagement.... I shall not be at liberty

till to-night—rather late. I will send word to you, then——"


She shook her head at him. "To-morrow," she substituted gaily. "Let

us have luncheon to-morrow under the trees again like this.


"To-morrow is too far away——"


"No, it is just right for me. And if you really want to please

me——"


"But does it please you to make me miserable——?"


"You can't be very miserable when you have a luncheon engagement,"

she insisted. "I'm not!"


He shrugged. "Till luncheon then—unless I should be back earlier

than I think." He gave her a quick look, but her face did not betray

awareness of the slip.


"Oh, of course, if you are at liberty sooner—And while you are busy

won't you manage things so I can stay out here awhile? I shall love

this garden, I know, when I am better friends with it," and after an

imperceptible pause he promised to send a maid back to keep watch

over her, and with a lingering pressure of hands and a look that

plainly said he was but briefly denying himself a more ardent

farewell, he hurried away through the banquet hall into the court.


She dared not run after to spy upon his departure. She could only

wait, hoping in every throbbing nerve that the maid would prove to

be the little one with the wart over her eye. And as she hoped she

feared, lest all her frail barrier of cards should be swept away by

a single breath.


If he should learn that the little dancer had visited her! If he

should discover that she was playing a game with him!


    CHAPTER X


    A MAID AND A MESSAGE


The March hare would have been a feeble comparison for Billy Hill's

madness if Robert Falconer could have seen him that Saturday

morning, that same Saturday on which Arlee was essaying her daring

rôle, for Billy Hill was sitting in the sun upon a camp stool, a

white helmet upon his head, an easel before him, and upon the easel

a square of blank canvas, and in Billy's left hand was a box of oils

and in his right a brush. And the camp stool upon which Billy was

stationed was planted directly before the small, high-arched door of

the Kerissen palace and in plain view of the larger door a few feet

to the right.


It had all followed upon acquaintance with the one-eyed man.


Taciturn in the beginning and suspicious of Billy's questionings,

that dark-skinned individual had at first betrayed abyssmal

ignorance of all save the virtues of stuffed crocodiles, but

convinced at last that this was no trap, but a genuine situation

from which he could profit, his greed overcame his native caution,

and through the aid of his jerky English and Billy's jagged Arabic

a certain measure of confidence was exchanged.


The one-eyed man then recollected that he had noticed a Turkish

officer and an American girl returning together to the hotel upon

that Wednesday afternoon. He had stared, because truly it was

amazing, even for American madness—and also the young girl was

beautiful. "A wild gazelle," was his word for her. The man was

Captain Kerissen. He was known to all the city—well known, he

was—in a certain way. It was not a good way for the ladies. Yes, he

had a motor car—a grand, gray car. (Billy remembered that the fatal

limousine had been gray.) It was well known that he had bought it

for a foreign woman whom he had brought from over-seas and installed

in the palace of his fathers. Yes, he knew well where that palace

was. His brother's wife's uncle was a eunuch there, but he was a

hard man who held his own counsel and that of his master.


Could a girl be shut up in that palace and the world be no wiser?

The one-eyed man stared scathingly at such ignorance. Why not? The

underworld might know, but native gossip never reached white ears.


What was the best way of finding out, then? The one-eyed man had no

hesitation about his answer.


A native must use his eyes and ears for the American. Through his

subtle skill and the American's money the discovery could be made.

The women servants would talk.


That was the way, Billy agreed, and quoted to the Arab his own

proverb, "A saint will weary of well-doing and a braggart of his

boasts, but a woman's tongue will never stop of itself," and the

one-eyed man had nodded, with an air of resigned understanding, and

quoted in answer, "There is nothing so great and nothing so small,

nothing so precious and nothing so foul, but that a woman will put

her tongue to it," and an understanding appeared to have been

reached.


The one-eyed man was to loiter about the palace, calling upon the

brother's wife's uncle if possible, and discover all that he could

without arousing suspicion. And Billy determined to do a little

loitering himself and quicken the one-eyed man's investigations and

keep watch of Kerissen's comings and goings, and a donkey boy was

hired by the one-eyed man to follow the Captain when he appeared in

the street and report the places to which he went.


It was all very ridiculous, of course, Billy cheerfully agreed with

himself, but by proving its own folly it would serve to allay that

extraordinarily nagging uneasiness of his. If he could just be

sure that little Miss Beecher wasn't tucked out of sight somewhere

in the power of that barbaric scamp with his Continental veneer!


Meanwhile the Oriental methods to be employed in the finding out

appealed to the young American's humor and his rash love of

adventure. He was grinning as he sat there on that stool and stared

at the blank canvas before him. He had felt the rôle of artist would

be an excellent screen for his loitering, but he had done no

painting for a little matter of twenty years, not since he was a

tiny lad, flat upon his stomach in his home library, industriously

tinting the robes and beards of Bible characters and the backgrounds

of the Holy Land—this work of art being one of the few permitted

diversions of the family Sabbath. Now he reflected that the scenes

for his brush were decidedly similar.


With humorous interest he fell to work, scaling off the palace on

his left, blocking off the cemetery ahead, and trying to draw a palm

without emphasizing the thought of a feather duster. His engineering

training made him critical of his lines and outlines, but when it

came to the introduction of color he had the sensation of a

shipwrecked mariner afloat upon uncharted seas.


The color that his eyes perceived was not the color which his

stubborn memory persisted in reminding him was the actual hue of the

events, and the color that he produced upon canvas was no kin to any

of them. But it sufficed for an excuse, and he worked away,

whistling cheerily, warily observant of the dark and silent façade

of the old palace and alertly interested in the little groups his

occupation transiently attracted. But these little groups were all

of passers-by, shawl-venders, package-deliverers, beggars, veiled

desert women with children astride their shoulders, and the live

hens they were selling beneath their mantles, and these groups

dissolved and drew away from him without his being able to attract

any observation from the palace.


But at least, he thought doggedly, any girl behind those latticed

windows up there could see him in the street, and if Arlee were

there she would understand his presence and plan to get word down

to him. But he began to feel extraordinarily foolish.


At length his patience was rewarded. The small door opened and the

stalwart doorkeeper, in blue robes and yellow English shoes, marched

pompously out to him and ordered him to be off.


Haughtily Billy responded that this was permitted, and displayed a

self-prepared document, gorgeous with red seals, which made the man

scowl, mutter, and shake his head and retire surlily to his door,

and finding a black-veiled girl peering out of it at Billy, he

thrust her violently within. But Billy had caught her eyes and tried

to look all the significance into them of which he was capable.


Nothing, however, appeared to develop. The door remained closed,

save for brief admissions of bread and market stuff from little boys

on donkey-back or on a bicycle, all of whom were led willingly into

conservation, but none of whom had been into the palace, and though

Billy pressed as close to the door as possible when the boys

knocked, he was only rewarded with a glimpse of the tiled vestibule

and inner court.


To the irate doorkeeper he protested that he was yearning to paint a

palace court, but though he held up gold pieces, the man ordered him

away in fury and spoke menacingly of a stick for such fellows.


Now, however cool and fresh it was in the garden that Saturday, it

was distinctly hot in the dusty street, and by noon, as Billy sat in

the shade beside the palace door, eating the lunch he had brought

and drinking out of a thermos bottle, he reflected that for a man to

cook himself upon a camp stool, feigning to paint and observing an

uneventful door, was the height of Matteawan. He despised

himself—but he returned to the camp stool.


Nothing continued to happen.


Travelers were few. Occasionally a carriage passed; once a couple of

young Englishmen on polo ponies galloped by; once a poor native came

down the road, moving his harem—a donkey-cart load of black

shrouded women, with three half-naked children bouncing on a long

tailboard.


Several groups of veiled women on foot proceeded to the cemetery and

back again.


The one-eyed man sauntered by in vain.


In the heat of the afternoon the wide door suddenly opened and

Captain Kerissen himself appeared on his black horse. He spurred off

at a gallop, intending apparently to ride down the artist on the

way, but changed his mind at the last and dashed past, showering him

with dust from his horse's hoofs. The little donkey-boy, lolling

down the road, started to follow him, crying out for alms in the

name of Allah.


Billy stared up at the windows. Not a handkerchief there, not a

signal, not a note flung into the street! In great derision he

squirted half a tube of cerulean blue upon his canvas.


This, he reflected, was zero in detective work. It was also minus in

adventure.


But one never knows when events are upon the wing. Almost

immediately there came into the flatness of his bored existence a

victoria containing those two English ladies he had met—in the

unconventional way which characterized his meetings with ladies in

Cairo—two days before.


The recognition was mutual. The curiosity appeared upon their side.

To his horror he saw that they had stopped their carriage and were

descending.


"How interesting!" said Miss Falconer, with more cordiality than she

had shown on the previous occasion. "How very interesting! So you

are an artist—I do a little sketching myself, you know."


"You do happen in the most unexpected places," smiled Lady Claire.


The English girl looked very cool and sweet and fresh to the heated

painter. His impression of her as a nice girl and a pretty girl was

speedily reinforced, and he remembered that dark-haired girls with

gray-blue eyes under dusky lashes had been his favorite type not so

long ago ... before he had seen Arlee's fairy gold.


"We've just been driving through the old cemetery—such interesting

tombs," said the elder lady, and Lady Claire added, "I should think

you could get better views there than here."


By this time they had reached the easel and stood back of it in

observation.


Blue, intensely blue, and thickly blue was the sky that Billy had

lavished. Green and rigid were the palms. Purple was the palace.

Very black lay the shadows like planks across the orange road.


Miss Falconer looked as if she doubted her own eyes. Hurriedly she

unfolded her lorgnette.


"It—it's just blocked in," said Billy, speaking with a peculiar

diffidence.


"Quite so—quite so," murmured the lady, bending closer, as if

fascinated.


Lady Claire said nothing. Stealing a look at her, Billy saw that she

was looking it instead.


Miss Falconer tried another angle. The sight of that lorgnette had a

stiffening effect upon Billy B. Hill.


"You get it?" he said pleasantly. "You get the—ah—symphonic chord

I'm striking?"


"Chord?" said Miss Falconer. "Striking," she murmured in a peculiar

voice.


"It's all in thirds, you see," he continued.


"Thirds!" came the echo.


"Perhaps you're of the old school?" he observed.


"Really—I must be!" agreed the lady.


"Ah!" said Billy softly, commiseratingly. He cocked his head at an

angle opposite from the slant of the lorgnette and stared his own

amazing canvas out of countenance.


"Then, of course," he said, "this hardly conveys——"


"What are you?" she demanded. "Is this a—a school?"


"I?" He seemed surprised that there could be any doubt about it. "I

am a Post-Cubist."


Miss Falconer turned the lorgnette upon him. "Oh, really," she said

vaguely. "I fancy I've heard something of that—you're quite new and

radical, aren't you?"


"Oh, we're old," he said gently, "very, very old. We have returned

to Nature—but not the nature of mere academicians. We paint, not

the world of the camera, but the world of the brain. We paint, not

the thing you think you see, but the way you think you see it—its

vibrations of your inner mentality. To paint the apple ripening on

the bough one should reproduce the gentle swelling of the maturing

fruit in your perception.... Now, you see, I am not trying to

reproduce the precise carving of that door; I do not fix the wavings

of that palm. I give you the cerebellic——"


"Quite so," said Miss Falconer, dropping her lorgnette and giving

the canvas the fixity of her unobstructed gaze. "It's most

interesting," she said, a little faintly. "Are there many of you?"


"I don't know," said Billy. "We do not communicate with one another.

That always influences, you know, and it is better to work out

thought alone."


"I should think it would be." Something in her tone suggested that

the inviolated solitude of the asylum suggested itself to her as a

fitting spot. "Well, we won't interrupt you any longer. You've been

most interesting.... The sun is quite hot, isn't it?" and with one

long, lingering look at the picture, a look convinced against its

will, she went her way toward the victoria.


But Lady Claire stood still. Billy had fairly forgotten all about

her, and now as he turned suddenly from the clowning with her

chaperon, he found her gaze being transferred from his picture to

himself. It was a very steady gaze, calm-eyed and deliberate.


"I'm afraid you're making game of us!" she said, in her musical,

high-bred tones, her clear eyes disconcertingly upon him. "Aren't

you?" she gently demanded.


"That's not fair." Billy was uncomfortable and looked away in haste.

He felt a grin coming.


Perhaps he was a shade too late, for Lady Claire laughed suddenly

and with a note of curious delight.


"You're too amusing!" she said. "What made you?... How did you

think of it all?... Are you just beginning?"


"Oh, I began twenty years ago," he smiled back, "but I haven't done

anything in the meantime."


Again she laughed with that ring of mischievous delight. "However

you could think of it all! I shan't tell on you—but she'll never

be done wondering." She turned away, her pretty face still bright

with humor, and then she turned back hesitantly toward him.


"It is hot here in this sun," she said. "It can't be good for

you. Shall we drive you back?"


She had lovely eyes, dark, smoky-blue under black lashes, and when

they held a gentle, half-shy, half-proud invitation, as they did

then, they were very unsettling eyes.... And it was hot on that

infernal camp stool. And there was a crick in the back of his neck

and his errand was glaringly a fool's errand....


He half rose, and as he did so the door in the palace opened a crack

and a veiled face peered furtively out. Billy sat down again.


"No, thank you," he said, "I think I'd better do a little more of

this."


In such light ways is the gate of opportunity closed and opened.

Everything that happened afterwards with such appalling

startlingness hung on that instant's decision.


For the moment he felt himself a donkey as Lady Claire turned

quietly away and the victoria rattled off with brisk finality. Then

the door opened again, and again the girl peered out, and furtively,

stealthily slipped just outside.


Billy caught up a pad and a pencil and called out a request to

sketch her, holding up some silver. Instantly she assumed a fixed

pose, with a nervous giggle behind her veil, and he came quickly

near her, pretending to be drawing. Her dark, curious eyes met his

with questioning significance, and he threw all caution aside and

plunged into his demands.


Did she want to earn money, he said quickly, in the Arabic he had

been preparing for such an encounter, and on her eager assent, he

asked if there was a foreign lady in the palace, an American.


The flash of her eyes told him that he had struck the mark before

her half-frightened words came.


His heart quickened with excitement. He might have suspected this

thing—but he had not really believed it! He asked, stammering in

his haste, "Does she want to get away?"


Again that knowing nod and the quick assent. Then the girl burst

into low-toned speech, glancing back constantly through the door she

held nearly shut behind her. Billy was forced to shake his head. It

was one thing to have picked up a little casual Arabic, and another,

and horribly different, thing to comprehend the rapid outpourings

behind that muffling veil.


Baffled, he went hurriedly on with his own questionings. Was this

lady safe? Again the nod and murmur of assent. Did she want help?

Vehement the confirmation. He repeated, with careful emphasis, "I

will reward you well for your help," and this time the direct

simplicity of her reply was entirely intelligible:


"How much?"


"One pound.... Two," he added, as she shook her head.


"Four," she demanded.


It was maddening to haggle, but it would be worse to yield.


"Two—and this," said Billy, drawing out the gold and some silver

with it.


She gave a frightened upward glance at the windows over them and

stepped closer. "I take it," she said. "Listen—" and that was all

that Billy could understand of the swift words she whispered to him.


"Slower—slower," he begged. "Once more—slower."


She frowned, and then, very slowly and distinctly, she articulated,

"T'âla lil genaina ... 'end eltura."


He wrote down what he thought it sounded like. "Go on."


"Allailade," she continued.


"That's to-night," he repeated. "What else?"


"Assâa 'ashara," she added hurriedly, and then, intelligible

again, "Now, quick, the money."


"Hold on, hold on." He was in despair. "Go over that again, please,"

and hastily the girl whispered the words again and he wrote down his

corrections. Then with a flourish he appeared to finish the sketch

and held out the gold and silver to her, saying, "Thank you,"

carelessly.


Quick as a flash she seized the money, leaving a little crumpled

ball of white linen in his hand, and then, apparently by lightning,

she secreted the gold, and with the silver shining in her dark palm

she came closer to him, urging him for another shilling, another

shilling for having a picture made. In an undertone she demanded,

"Is it yes? Shall I say yes to the lady?"


"Yes, yes, yes," said Billy, desperately, to whatever the unknown

message might be. "Take a note to her for me?" he demanded, starting

to scribble one, but she drew back with a quick negation, and as a

sound came from the palace she slipped back through the door and was

gone like a shadow when a blind is thrown open.


Only the crumpled little ball of linen remained in Billy's hand. He

straightened it out. It was a lady's handkerchief, a dainty thing,

delicately scented. In the corners were marvels of sheer embroidery

and among the leaves he found the initial he was seeking. It was the

letter B.


As he stared down on it, that tiny, telltale initial, his face went

white under its tan and his mouth compressed till all the humor and

kindliness of it were lost in a line of stark grimness. And then he

swung on his heel and packed up his painting kit in a fury of haste,

and with one last, upturned look at those mocking windows, he was

off down the road like a shot.


There were just two things to do. The first was to discover the

message hidden in those unknown words.


The second was to do exactly as that message bade.


    CHAPTER XI


    OVER THE GARDEN WALL


Two oil lamps flared in the little coffee-house. In one circle of

yellow light two bearded Sheiks were playing dominoes with

imperturbable gravity; the other lamp flickered over an empty table

beneath which the thin, flea-bitten legs of a ragged urchin were

showing in the oblivion of his tired sleep. In the shadow beyond sat

a young American with a keen, impatient face, and a one-eyed Arab

shrouded in a huge burnous.


"I make fine dragoman?" the Arab was saying proudly. "This is ver'

old coffee-house. Many things happen here, ver' strange——"


"Yes, but I'm sick of the doggone place," said Billy fiercely. "I

can't sit still and swallow coffee any longer. Can't we start now?"


"Too soon—too soon before the time. You say ten? Come, we go next

door. Nice place next door, perhaps—dancing, maybe."


There was noise enough next door, certainly, to promise dancing. The

strident notes of Oriental music came shrieking out the open

doorway, but as Billy stepped within and stared over the heads of

the squatting throng, he saw no sinewy dancers, but only two tiny

girls in bright colors huddled wearily against the wall. The music

which was absorbing every look came from the brazen throat of a huge

instrument in the corner.


"Lord—a phonograph!" thought the young man in disgust, resenting

this intrusion of the genius of his race into foreign fields.


The squatting men, their dark lips parted in pleased smiles, were

too intent upon the innovation to turn at his entrance, but the

little girls caught sight of him and ran forward, begging

clamorously, their bracelets clanking on their outstretched arms.


With a little silver he tried to soften the vigor of the one-eyed

man's dismissal. "This cheap place—no good dancers any more," the

Arab uttered in disgust. "New man here—no good. Maybe next door

better—eh?"


But next door was only a flight of steps and a lone little doll of a

sentinel, painted and hung like a bedizened idol. Only the dark eyes

in the tinted sockets were alive, and these turned curiously after

the strange young white man who had dropped a coin into her

outstretched hand and passed on so hurriedly.


"I don't want any more of these joints," Billy was saying vehemently

to his harassed guide. "It's dark as the Styx now—let's be on our

way."


The street they were on was narrow enough for any antiquarian, but

the one into which the Arab guide now turned was so narrow that the

jutting bays of the houses seemed pushing their faces impudently

against their neighbors. A voice in one room could have been heard

as clearly in the one over the way. It was a mean little street,

squalid and poor and pitiful, but it maintained its stripped

dignities of screened windows and isolation. It was better not to

wonder what nights were like in those women's rooms in summer heat.


The lane-like path stopped at a rickety sort of wharf, and at their

approach a black head bobbed quickly up from a waiting boat. It was

the little boy who had shadowed the Captain that day—reporting his

arrival at the Khedivial palace—and he climbed out now and sat on

the wharf, watching curiously while Billy and his guide bestowed

themselves in the long canoe, and pushed silently away.


It was an eerie backwater in which they were paddling, a sluggish

stream which moved between dark houses. Sometimes it scraped against

their sides and lapped their balconies; sometimes it was held in

check by walls and narrow terraces. For Billy the water between the

dark houses, the mirrored stars, the unexpected flare of some oil

lamp and its still reflection, the long windings and the stagnant

smells held their suggestions of Venice for his senses, and he

thought the business he was going about was very similar to the

business which had brought so many of the gentry of Venice to sudden

and undesired ends.


The flies were horribly thick here. They settled upon the faces and

arms of the paddlers, totally unapprehensive of rebuff. Billy's

flesh crawled. He finished the swarm with a ringing slap that

brought a low caution from his guide.


Now the canal was wider and shallower. The houses receded, and a

field or so appeared, and frequent walls hedged the way. Then

suddenly the houses came down again to the water, and the ruins of

old mosques and palaces lined the banks for a time; to be replaced

by walls again. The windings were interminable, and just when he was

thinking that his silent guide was as confused as he was, the man

made a sudden gesture to the right bank where a tiny strip of land

showed above the water clinging to a high brick wall, and with

careful, soundless strokes they brought the canoe up to that land.


Billy looked at his watch. It was nearly ten. Hurriedly he climbed

out, taking out the stout, notched pole and the knotted rope with

the iron hook at the end which he had prepared. The message which

had been so unintelligible to him was very simple. "Escape by canal

to-night—come to garden at ten," had been the words, and Billy, on

hearing the description of the canal from the one-eyed man, had felt

he understood.


"You're sure this is the place?" he demanded, and on the man's much

injured protestation, "Because if it isn't I'll wring your neck

instead of Kerissen's," he cheerfully promised and set his pole

against the wall, showing the man how to steady it. It was not the

best climbing arrangement in the world, but time had been extremely

limited, and the one-eyed man not inclined to pursue any

investigations which would advertise their expedition.


Wrapping the rope about his shoulders, he started to pull himself up

that notched pole the Arab was holding against the wall, feeling

desperately for any hold for toes and fingers in the rough chunks

between the old bricks, and breathing hard he reached the top and

threw one leg over. He felt something grind through the serge of his

trousers and sting into the flesh.


"Ground glass—the Old Boy!" said Billy through his teeth. He

hoisted himself cautiously, and with his handkerchief swept the top

of the wall as clean as he could. He heard the little pieces fall

with a perilously loud tinkling sound, and flattened himself upon

the wall, and strained his eyes through the darkness of the garden,

but no alarm was raised. The shadows seemed empty.


He hoped to the Lord that no disturbance would break out in the

garden, for the man below would be off in the canoe like a flash. He

had no illusions about the one-eyed man's loyalty, but the fellow

was already in the secret; he was needy and resourceful and as

trustworthy as any dragoman that he could have gone to. And a

dragoman would have had a reputation and a patronage he'd fear to

lose. This melancholy Arab, hawking crocodiles for a Greek Jew, had

more to gain than lose.


By now he had caught the end of the rough hook over the top of the

wall, and let down the knotted rope into the garden below. It was

long enough, thank goodness, he thought, wondering under what

circumstances and in what company he would ascend it again. Then

with one more keen look into the garden, and a reassuring touch of

the pocket where his revolver bulged, he gripped the rope and

swiftly lowered himself.


Keeping close to the wall he pressed toward the buildings on the

right, which he had been told was the wing of the harem, and as he

stepped forward a flat black shadow near the wall came suddenly to

life. It sprang to its feet, revealing a shrouded little form,

wrapped and hooded in black, and ran to him with steps that stumbled

in excitement.


"Quick, quick!" breathed an almost inaudible voice of terror, and

Billy flung one strong arm about the girl and dashed toward the

dangling rope. Gripping it with one hand he flung the light figure

over his left shoulder, and with a cheerily whispered "Hang tight,"

he threw himself into the ascent. It was arm-wrenching,

muscle-racking work, with that dead weight upon him, but the touch

of those soft arms clinging childishly about his neck seemed to

double and treble his strength, and with incredible quickness he

lifted her to the top of the wall, and then, catching her by the

wrists, he lowered her into the upreaching clasp of the Arab.


An instant more and he had reversed his rope ladder and climbed down

beside her as she stood waiting, and in the throbbing triumph of

that moment he flung his arm grippingly about her to sweep her into

the boat. But as she raised her face to his, the shrouding mantle

fell away, and he found himself staring down into the exultant face

and bright, dark eyes of a girl he had never seen before.


Back of them beyond the wall, pandemonium was breaking out.


'He found himself staring down into the bright dark

eyes of a girl he had never seen'


"He found himself staring down into the bright dark

eyes of a girl he had never seen"


    CHAPTER XII


    THE GIRL FROM THE HAREM


He was dumb with the shock. Then, "Who are you?" he demanded. "And

where is she—where is Arlee Beecher?"


On her own face the astonishment grew. "What you mean? Frederick—he

not send you?" she gasped, and then as the outcries grew louder and

louder behind them she gripped convulsively at his arms. "Oh, quick!

come away—quick, quick!" she besought.


"I came for Arlee Beecher—an American girl. Isn't she held here?

Isn't she back there?"


"What you going to do? What——"


"I'm going to get her!" he said fiercely. "Tell me——"


He had caught her and unconsciously shook her as if to shake the

words out of her. Furiously she struggled with him.


"Let me go. No, no, she is not there! No one is there! You are gone

crazy to stay! They will kill me if they catch me—they will fire

over the wall. Oh, for God's sake, help me quick!"


"She's not there?" he repeated stupidly, and then at her vehement

"No, no! I tell you no!" he drew a breath of deep astonishment

and chagrin, and turned to stow her safely low in the boat.

Hurriedly he and the one-eyed man bent over their paddles, and very

swiftly the long, dark canoe went gliding down the stream, but not

any too swiftly, for in an instant they heard a triumphant yell

behind them, and then light, thudding feet along the path.


Steadily Billy urged the canoe forward with powerful strokes that

seemed to be lifting it out of the water at each impulse, and they

swept past a wall that reaching to the river bank must block their

pursuers for a time, and though there was a path after that, there

was soon another wall, and no more pursuit along the water edge. But

every opening ahead now might mean an ambush, and as soon as a

narrow lane showed between the houses to the left, the one-eyed man

steered swiftly there and Billy sprang out with the girl and they

raced through the lane into the adjoining street.


He looked up and down it; either they had got out at the wrong lane

or the cab they had ordered to be in waiting had failed them, but

there was no time for speculation and they walked on as fast as they

could without the appearance of flight. The stray loiterers on the

dark street stared curiously as they passed, to see a young American

in gray tweeds, his cap pulled over his eyes, with a woman in the

Mohammedan wrap and mantle, but no one stopped them, and in another

minute they saw a lonely cab rattling through the streets and

climbed quickly in.


"And now, for Heaven's sake, tell me all about it!" besought Billy

B. Hill, staring curiously at his most unforeseen companion.


With a deep-drawn sigh of relief she had snuggled back against the

cushioned seat, and now she flung off the shrouding mantle and

looked up to meet his gaze with a smile of excited triumph.


She had the prettiest teeth he had ever seen, lovely little rows of

pearls, and the biggest and brightest of dark eyes with wide lashes

curling dramatically back. Even in the thrill and elation of the

moment there was a spark of provocation in those eyes for the

good-looking young man who stared down at her, and Billy would have

been a very wooden young man, indeed, if he had not felt a tingling

excitement in this unexpected capture, for all the destruction of

his romantic plans. So this, he thought rapidly, was the foreign

girl in Kerissen's house, and Arlee, bless her little golden head,

was safe where she planned, in Alexandria. A warm glow of happiness

enveloped him at that.


"Now tell me all about it," he demanded again. "You are running away

from Kerissen?"


"Oh, yes," she cried eagerly. "You must not let him catch us. We are

safe—yes?"


"I should rather think so," Billy laughed. "And there's a gun in my

pocket that says so.... And so you sent me that message to-day by

that little native girl? How in the world did that happen?"


"That girl is one who will do a little for money, you understand,"

said the Viennese, "and I have told her to look sharp out for a

foreign gentleman who come to save me. You see I have sent for a

friend, and I think that he—but never mind. That girl she come

running this afternoon to where I am shut in way back in the palace,

and she say that a foreign gentleman is painting a picture out in

the street, and he stare very cunning at her. So I tell her to find

out if he is the one for me, and to tell him to come quick this

night. She was afraid to take note—afraid the eunuch catch her. So

she went to you. She told afterwards that you ask her if there is

any strange lady there anxious to get away, and she give you the

message and my handkerchief and you say you will come—and my, how

you give me one great surprise!"


"And a great disappointment," said Billy grinning.


"Oh, no, no," she denied, eyes and lips all mischievous smiles. "I

say to myself, 'My God! That is a fine-looking young man! He and I

will have something to say to each other'—h'm?"


"Now who in the world are you?" demanded Billy bluntly. "And how did

you happen to get into all this?"


Volubly she told. She dwelt at picturesque length upon her shining

place upon the Viennese stage; she recounted her triumphs, she

prophesied the joy of the playgoers at her return to them. Darkly

she expatiated upon the villainy of the Turkish Captain, who had

lured her to such incarceration. Gleefully she displayed the

diamonds upon her small person which she was extracting from that

affair.


"Not so bad, after all—h'm?" she demanded, in a brazen little

content. "Maybe that prison time make good for me," and Billy shook

his head and chuckled outright at the little baggage.


But through his amusement a prick of uneasiness was felt. The

picture she had painted of the Captain corroborated his wildest

imaginings.


"You're dead sure you know all that was going on in that palace?" he

demanded. "There wasn't any American girl coaxed into it on some

pretext?"


He wanted merely the reassurance of her answer, but to his surprise

and growing alarm she hesitated, looking at him half fearfully and

half ashamedly. "Oh, I—I don't know about that," she murmured, with

evasive eyes. "An American girl—very light hair—yes?"


"Very light hair—Oh, good God!" He leaned forward, gripping her

wrist as if afraid she would spring out of the carriage. "You said

she wasn't there," he thrust at her in a voice that rasped.


"I said I don't know—don't know any such name you say. I never hear

it. You hurt me—take your hand away."


"Not till you tell me." But he loosened his harsh grip. "Now tell me

all you know—please tell me all you know," he besought with a

sudden melting into desperate entreaty. Worriedly he stared at this

curious little kitten-thing beside him on whose truth now that other

girl's life was resting.


"Well, I tell you true I do not know that name," began Fritzi

Baroff, with a little sullen dignity over her shame. "And I saved

your life, for it was death for you to go back to that palace. You

heard them coming for us. You would have got yourself killed and

that little girl would be no better. Now I can tell you how to help

her."


"All right—tell me," said the young American in a tense voice.

"Tell me everything you know about it," and Fritzi told him,

throwing aside all pretense of her uncertainty about Arlee,

revealing every detail of the situation that she knew.


And from the heights of his gay relief Billy Hill was flung back

into the deeps of desperate indignation. The anger that had surged

up in him that afternoon when he had felt his fears confirmed flamed

up in him now in a fire of fury. His blood was boiling.... Arlee

Beecher in the power of that Turkish devil! Arlee Beecher prisoned

within that ghastly palace! It was unreal. It was monstrous.... That

radiant girl he had danced with, that teasing little sprite, half

flouting, half flirting. Why, the thing was unthinkable!


He put a hand on the dancer's arm. "We must go to the consul at

once," he said. "We must get her out to-night."


"Consul!" The girl gave a short, derisive laugh. "This is no matter

for consuls, my young friend. The law is slow, and by the time that

law will stand knocking upon the palace doorstep, your little girl

with the fair hair will be buried very deep and fast—I think she

would not be the first woman bricked into those black walls.... You

must go about this yourself.... You are in love with her—yes?" she

added impertinently, with keen, uptilted eyes.


"That's another story," Billy curtly informed her. He made no

attempt to analyze his feeling for Arlee Beecher. She had enchanted

him in those two days that he had known her. She had obsessed his

thoughts in those two days of her disappearance. Now that he was

aware of her peril every selfish thought was overwhelmed in burning

indignation. He told himself that he would do as much for any girl

in her situation, and, indeed, so hot ran his rage and so dearly did

his young blood love rash adventure and high-handed justice, that

there was some honest excuse for the statement!


"Zut! A man does not risk his neck for a matter of indifference!"

said the little Baroff sagely, her knowing eyes on Billy's grim

young face. "So I am to be the sister to you—the Platonic

friend—h'm?" she observed with droll resignation. "Never mind—I

will help you get her out as you got me—Gott sei dank! There is a

way, I think—if you are not too particular about that neck. I will

tell you all and draw you a plan when we get to a hotel."


But before they got to a hotel there was an obstacle or two to be

overcome. A lady in Mohammedan wraps might not be exactly persona

grata at fashionable hotels at midnight. Casting off the wrap

Fritzi revealed herself in a little pongee frock that appeared to be

suitable for traveling, and with two veils and Billy's cap for a

foundation she produced an effect of headgear not unlike that of

some bedraped tourists.


"I arrived on the night train," she stated as they drew up before

the shining hotel. "It is late now for that night train—but we

waited for my luggage, which you will observe is lost. So I pay for

my room in the advance—I think you had better give me some money

for that—I have nothing but these," and she indicated her flashing

diamonds.


"My name," said Billy, handing over some sovereigns with the first

ray of humor since her revelation to him, "my name, if you should

care to address me, is Hill—William B. Hill."


"William B. Hill," she echoed with an air of elaborate precision,

and then flashed a saucy smile at him as he helped her out of the

carriage. "What you call Billy, eh?"


"You've got it," he replied in resignation.


"Hill—that means a mountain," she commented. "A mountain of good

luck for me—h'm? And that B—what is that for?"


"My middle name," said Billy patiently, as they reached the door the

Arab doorman was holding open for them.


Absently she laughed. Her dark eyes were sparkling at the vision of

the safe and shining hotel, the dear familiar luxury, the sounds and

sights of her lost Continental life. A few late arrivals from some

dance gave a touch of animation to the wide rooms, and Fritzi's eyes

clung delightedly to the group.


"God, how happy I am!" she sighed.


Billy was busy avoiding the clerk's knowing scrutiny. It was the

same clerk he had coerced with real cigars to enlighten him

concerning Arlee Beecher, and he felt that that clerk was thinking

things about him now, mistaken and misguided things, about his

predilections for the ladies. Philosophically he wondered where they

had better try after this.


But he underestimated the battery of Fritzi's charms, or else the

serene assurance of her manner.


"My letters—letters for Baroff," she demanded of the clerk. "None

yet. Then my room, please.... But I sent a wire from Alexandria.

That stupid maid," she turned to explain to Billy, her air the last

stand of outraged patience. "She is at the train looking for that

luggage she lost," she added to the clerk, and thereupon she

proceeded to arrange for the arrival of the fictitious maid whom

Billy heard himself agreeing to go back and fetch if she did not

turn up soon, and to engage a room for herself—a much nicer room

than Billy himself was occupying—then handed over Billy's

sovereigns and turned happily away jingling the huge key of her

room.


"It is a miracle!" she cried again, exultant triumph in every pretty

line of her. "My heart dances, my blood is singing—Oh, if I were on

the stage now, the music crashing, the lights upon me, the house

packed! I would enchant them! I would dance myself mad.... Ah, what

you say now—shall we have a little bottle of champagne to drink to

our better acquaintance, Mr. Billy?"


"Not this evening," said the unemotional young man. "You are going

to sit down at this desk and draw me those plans of the palace."


Petulantly she shrugged at her rescuer. "How stupid—to-morrow you

may not have that chance for the champagne," she observed. "You

think of nothing but to go back and get killed, then? And I must

help you? Very well. Here, I will draw it for you and I will tell

you all I know."


She sat down at a desk and began working out the diagrams, and at

last she handed the paper to Billy, who sat beside her, and pointed

out the rooms and scribbled the words on them for his aid.


"It is very simple," she said. "That first square is for the court,

and the next square is for the garden. The hall of banquets comes

so, between them, and the hall is two stories tall, and across the

top of that, from the selamlik to the harem, runs that little

secret passage. And at the end of it, here, is the little panel into

the rose room where she is, and beside the panel outside in the

passage are the little steps that go up to that tower room, where

they put me on the top. And from that top room I broke out a locked

door on the roof—that is how I got away. I climbed down at the end

of the harem from one roof to another where it is unfinished.... The

rose room is here on the garden, but the windows have bars, and

those bars are too strong for breaking. I have tried it! There is no

way out but the secret way by that passage into the men's wing, or

the other way through the door into the long hall and down the

little stairs into the anteroom below. How Seniha hated me when I

made laughter and noise and talk going up and down those stairs to

my motor car!"


She laughed impishly, pointing out Seniha's rooms, facing on the

street, and contributing several bizarre anecdotes of the palace

life. But Billy was not to be diverted, and went over the plans

again and again, before the diminished number of lights and the

hoverings of the attendant Arabs recalled the lateness of the hour

to his absorption.


But late as they were they were not the only occupants of the lift.

Returning from a masquerade, a domino over his arm, stood Falconer.

Civilly enough he returned Billy's greeting, with no apparent

awareness of the little lady in pongee, but Billy was conscious that

her flaunting caliber had been promptly registered. And to his

annoyance the actress raised big eyes of reproach to him.


"No champagne for me, after all, Mr. Billy!" she sighed. "You are

not very good for a celebration—h'm?... Well, then—good night."


Her parting smile as she left the car adroitly included the tall

aristocratic young Englishman with the little moustache.


Sharply Billy turned to him. "Come up to my room, please. I have

something to say to you."


In silence Falconer followed. Billy flung shut the door, drew a long

breath, and turned to him.


"Do you know where I got that girl?" he demanded.


It took several seconds of Falconer's level-lidded look of distaste

to bring home the realization.


"Oh, see here," he protested, "wait till you understand this

thing.... I pulled that girl over Kerissen's back wall at ten

o'clock to-night. I thought she was Miss Beecher, but a mistake had

been made and the wrong girl arrived. But the point is this—Arlee

Beecher is in that palace. This girl saw her and talked with her

last night. Now we've got to get her out. It's a two-man job," said

Billy, "or you'd better believe I'd never have come to you again."


He had given it like a punch, and it knocked the breath out of

Falconer for one floored instant. But he was no open-mouthed

believer. The thing was more unthinkable to him than to Billy's

romantic and adventurous mind, and the very notion was so revolting

that he fought it stoutly.


From beginning to end Billy hammered over the story as he knew it,

explaining, arguing, debating, and then he drew out the plans of the

palace and flung them on the table by Falconer while he continued

his excited tramping up and down the room.


Falconer studied the plans, worried his moustache, stared at Billy's

tense and resolute face, and took up the plans again, his own chin

stubborn.


"Granted there's a girl—you can't be sure it's Miss Beecher," he

maintained doggedly. "This Baroff girl had no idea of her name. Now

Miss Beecher would have told her name, the very first thing, it

appears to me, and the names of her friends in Cairo, asking for the

Baroff's offices in getting a letter to me—us."


"She may have been too hurried to get to it. She had so many

questions to ask. And she probably expected to see the girl again

the next day or night."


"Possibly," said Falconer without conviction.


"But where, then, is Miss Beecher?"


"We may hear from her to-morrow morning."


"We won't," said Billy.


Falconer was silent.


"Good Lord!" the American burst out, "there can't be two girls in

Cairo with blue eyes and fair hair whom Kerissen could have lured

there last Wednesday! There can't be two girls with chaperons

departing up the Nile! Why—why—the whole thing's as clear to

me—as—as a house afire!"


"I don't share your conviction."


"Very well, then, if you don't think it is Miss Beecher, you don't

have to go into this thing. If you can feel satisfied to lay the

matter before the ambassador and let that unknown girl wait for the

arm of the law to reach her, you are at perfect liberty, of course,

to do so." Billy was growing colder and colder in tone as he grew

hotter and hotter in his anger.


Falconer said nothing. He was a very plucky young man, but he had no

liking at all for strange and unlawful escapades. He didn't

particularly mind risking his neck, but he liked to do it in

accredited ways, in polo, for instance, or climbing Swiss peaks, or

swimming dangerous currents.... But he was young—and he had red

hair. And he remembered Arlee Beecher. These three days had not been

happy ones for him, even sustained as he was by righteous

indignation. And if there was any chance that this prisoned girl was

Arlee, as this infatuated American was so furiously sure—He

reflected that Billy was doing the sporting thing in giving him the

chance of it.


"I'll join you," he said shortly. "I can't let it go, you know, if

there's a chance of its being Miss Beecher."


"Good!" said Billy, holding out his hand and the two young men

clasped silently, eyeing each other with a certain mutual respect

though with no great increase of liking.


"Now, this is my idea," Billy went on, and proceeded to develop it,

while Falconer carefully studied the plans and made a shrewd

suggestion here and there.


It was late in the morning when they parted.


"You must muzzle that Baroff girl," was Falconer's parting caution.

"We must keep this thing deuced quiet, you know."


"Of course. He shan't get wind of it ahead."


"Not only that. We mustn't have talk afterwards. It would kill the

girl, you know."


Billy nodded. "She would hate it, I expect."


"Hate it? My word, it would finish her—a tale of that kind going

the rounds.... She could never live it down."


"Live it down? It would set her up in conversation for the rest of

her life!" Billy chuckled softly. "That is, if it comes out all

right—and that's the only way I can imagine its coming out."


With one hand on the door Falconer paused to stare back at him. "You

don't mean she'd want to tell about it!" he ejaculated with

unplumbed horror.


Billy was suddenly sobered. "Well, nobody but you and I and the

Baroff know it now," he said, "and I think we can keep the Baroff's

mouth shut.... I'll see her in the morning. You'd better get in a

nap to-morrow, and I will, too, for we'll want steady nerves. Good

night; I'm glad you're going with me."


"I'm damned if I'm glad," said the honest Englishman, with a wry

grin. "If we get our throats cut, I hope Miss Beecher will return

from the desert in time for our obsequies."


"Something in that red-headed chap I like after all," soliloquized

Billy B. Hill, as he turned toward his long-deferred repose. "Hanged

if he hasn't grit to go into a thing on an off chance!... Now, as

for me, I'm sure."


    CHAPTER XIII


    TAKING CHANCES


Late as he went to sleep, Billy B. Hill was up in good season that

Sunday morning. The need for cautioning Fritzi Baroff haunted him,

and he was not satisfied until he had had breakfast with that lively

young lady and laid down the law to her upon the situation.


She was very loath not to talk about herself at first. She wanted to

tell her tale to the papers and see if one of them would be hardy

enough to publish the story of the outrageous incarceration; she

wanted to cable the Viennese theater where she had played of her

sensational detention—in short, she wanted to get all the possible

publicity out of her durance vile and to advertise her small person

from Cairo to the Continent.


But Billy was urgent. "You just bide a wee on this publicity stunt,"

he demanded. "Cable your manager and press agent all you want

to—but don't talk around the hotel here—and whatever you do and

whatever you say, keep Miss Beecher's name and mine out of it."


He was very decided about that, and because she was very grateful to

him and because she liked him and because she lacked other friends

and other pocketbooks, the little Viennese held her tongue as

directed. And she borrowed as much money as Billy would lend her,

and drove off to the small shops which were open that day, and found

a frock or two and a hat which she declared passable, and returned

transfigured to the hotel and rendered the table where she lunched

with Billy, with the air of possessing him, quite the most

conspicuous in the room. The ladies gazed past them with chill eyes;

the men stared covertly, with the surreptitious envy with which even

the most virtuous of men surveys a lucky devil. And Billy sadly

perceived that he was acquiring a reputation.


He did not blame Miss Falconer for turning haughtily aside as he and

his vivid companion went past them in the veranda. But he did think

her disdainful lack of memory a little overdone.


His cheeks were still red as he looked away from her and encountered

the direct eyes of the girl who followed her.


"Oh, how do you do, Mr. Hill?" said Lady Claire, as clear as a

bell. "It's such a nice day, isn't it?" she added, a little

breathlessly, as she went by.


"It's much better than it was," said Billy, and he turned back to

open the door for her.


"Claire!" said Miss Falconer from within.


"Coming, dear," said Lady Claire, and with a little smile of defiant

friendliness at the young American she was gone.


But the memory of that plucky little smile stayed right with Billy.

The girl liked him, she liked him in spite of his unknown

antecedents, his preposterous picture, his conspicuous companion.

She had a mind of her own, that tall English girl with the lovely

eyes and the proud mouth. In a warm surge of friendliness his

thoughts went out to her, and he wished vaguely that he could let

her know how fine he thought she was.


Within an hour that vague wish came true. He had packed Fritzi off,

with a newly acquired maid, for a drive up and down the safe public

streets and he had re-interviewed the one-eyed man and the native

chauffeur that the one-eyed man introduced for the evening's work,

and he was at one of the public desks in the writing room, inditing

a letter to his aunt, which, he whimsically appreciated, might be

his last mortal composition, and reflecting thankfully that it was

highly unnecessary to make a will, when Lady Claire strolled into

the room and over to a desk.


She tried a pen frowningly, and Billy jumped to offer another. "Oh,

thank you," she said. She seemed not to have seen him before.


"That was rather nice of you, you know," he said gravely.


She looked up at him.


"I'm not really a wolf," he continued, the gravity surrendering to

his likable, warm smile, "and I'm glad you recognized it."


Her reply took him unawares. "I think you're splendid," said Lady

Claire. "I thought so in the bazaars when you came to my help and

stood up to that beastly German."


"Oh, he wasn't such a beastly German, after all," Billy deprecated.

"And here I've had a message to you from him and never remembered to

give it. The fellow called on me the next morning in gala attire and

offered every apology and satisfaction in his power—even the

satisfaction of the duel, if I desired it. I didn't. But I promised

to express his deep apologies to you. He was horribly shocked at

himself. He'd been drinking, he said, to forget a 'sadness' which

possessed him. His lady love had failed to keep her tryst and life

was very dark."


"I don't wonder at her," said Lady Claire unforgivingly. "I'm sure

he must have been horrid to her!"


"I rather think she was horrid to him," Billy reflected, "although

she was a very sprightly looking lady love. He showed me her picture

in the back of his watch.... By George!" he uttered violently.


"What is it?"


"Oh—an idea, that's all. Something I must really attend to before

I—this afternoon, I mean. But there's no hurry about it," he added

cheerily.


Oh, Billy, Billy! Not even with his blood hot with thoughts of the

evening's work, not even with his memory ridden with Arlee's gay

witchery, could he keep his restless young eyes from laughing down

at her. But there wasn't a notion in the back of his honest head as

to the picture he was making in Lady Claire's eyes as he leaned,

long-limbed, broad-shouldered, lazily at ease against the desk, his

gray eyes very bright between their dark lashes, his dark hair

sweeping back from his wide forehead.


"Are you sure?" she asked of him, with the smile that he drew from

her. "Is it the inspiration for another picture?"


"No, no—that was my first and my last. That was the one purple

bloom of my art. I have laid my brushes by.... But I'm keeping you

from that letter you were going to write."


"It's just a few lines for Miss Falconer," Lady Claire unnecessarily

explained. "We are going to drive out to the Gezireh Palace Hotel

for tea, and she thought her brother might like to go out with us if

he came in in time."


She did not add why Miss Falconer was unable to write her own notes,

but slanted her blue-hatted head over the desk and then hastily

blotted her brief lines and tucked the sheet into an envelope.

Hesitantly she looked up at Billy.


"Have you been out to the Gezireh Palace?" she very innocently

inquired.


"Alone," said Billy.


"It's very jolly there," said she. "It's so gay—and the music is

quite good."


"H'm," meditated Billy. "The condemned man ate a hearty tea of

Orange Pekoe and cress sandwiches," he reflected silently. He also

reflected that Miss Falconer would be furious—and that invited

him—and that time was interminable and that this expedition was as

good a way of getting through the afternoon as any other. Thereupon

he turned to the English girl, with a humorous challenge in his

gaze. "I wonder if you and Miss Falconer would let this be my tea

party?" he suggested.


"Miss Falconer will be delighted," said Lady Claire mendaciously.


The traces of that delight, however, lay beneath so well schooled an

exterior that they were decidedly non-apparent. Nor did Robert

Falconer's mien reveal any hint of joy when he returned to the hotel

and found the two ladies starting with Billy. He joined them with

rather the air of a watch dog, but that air soon wore away during

the long drive under the spell of young Hill's frank friendliness

and gay good humor. For Billy was extravagantly in spirits.

Excitement stirred in him like wine; his blood was on fire with

thoughts of the evening.


"It's the fool lark of the thing," he said, half apologetically,

to Falconer's wonder when the two young men were alone for a minute

on the Gezireh verandas. "Didn't you ever want to be a pirate?"


The red-headed young man nodded. "Yes, but this business doesn't

make me feel like a pirate—more like a second-story man!"


"I've left letters with Fritzi Baroff," said Hill, "and if we're not

back by morning, she's to go to the authorities with them."


"That won't do us any good," said the Englishman grimly.


But after the ladies returned it was a very merry-seeming tea party.

Even Miss Falconer unbent to the artist, as she persisted in calling

Billy, though he had dutifully enlightened her that engineering was

his true and proper life work, and art but a random diversion, and

she promised to show him the sketches which she had been making,

and piled him with questions about his mysterious America.


And Lady Claire was very prettily animated, and rallied Falconer

upon his absent-mindedness and told Billy tales of her English home

and how her father had threatened to change the name of the Hall to

Mädchenheim because there were five daughters of them. "Five

girls near an age, Mr. Hill, and all poor as church mice!" she had

blithely asserted.


But from what Billy heard of balls and hunters and "seasons," he

gleaned that being poor as church mice, for these five titled girls,

meant merely an effort in keeping up with the things they felt

should be theirs by right divine. And as Billy listened, feeling the

force of the girl's attraction, the charm of her serene confidence

and the pleasant air of security and well-being that hedged her in,

he stole a covert glance at Falconer's unrevealing countenance and

reflected that it was rather a stormy day for that young man when he

became entangled with the fortunes of little Miss Beecher. It was

also a stormy day for himself, but he felt that storms belonged more

naturally to his adventurous lot.


But it was characteristic of Falconer when once committed to a plan

not to open his mind to the objections which besieged it. So that

night, at the fall of dark, as the two young men motored forth

together, he maintained a stolid resolution which refused to look

back. The approach of the danger was tuning up his nerves, and

whatever his common sense might think about it, his youth and pluck

greeted the adventure with a quickening heart and a rash warmth of

blood.


Both young men were resolute and confident. Either would have been

more than human if he had not looked a trifle askance upon the other

and wished to thunder that he had been able to go into it alone and

to have tasted the intoxication of delivering the girl single-handed

out of the den of thieves. But the success of the plan was

paramount, as Billy reminded himself.


He found himself hoping wildly that she would see him as well as

Falconer.


"She has probably forgotten all about me," he thought ruefully. "She

won't remember that dance with me, nor that chat next morning. I'm

just an Also Met. She won't even perceive me. She'll see that

sandy-haired deliverer—and she'll tell him how right he was and how

good to come after her——"


Thus jealousy darkly painted his undoing. "But, darn it, I had to

ask him!" Thus he downed his ungenerous thoughts. "It needed two men

at least—and besides, I don't want any handicap of gratitude in

this."


They left the automobile in the Mohammedan graveyard with exact and

impressive instructions. And then they stole back among the gloomy

trees and ghostly tombs to where the canal washed the foot of the

little terraces, and there the one-eyed man sat waiting in the

canoe, a figure of profound misanthropy.


Silently he lifted a stricken but set countenance, and they climbed

in and the three paddled off, approaching the back of the palace

with wary eyes, for they were afraid that a guard might now be set

upon the walls. But Billy had argued that Kerissen was unaware of

Fritzi's knowledge of Arlee's identity; in fact she had at first

supposed her a willing supplanter like herself, and so he would not

be apprehensive of any of her revelations. And he did not dream that

Fritzi's rescuers were interested in Arlee.


At the strip of path the canoe made softly to shore and the two

young men climbed out, while the Arab remained in the canoe, his

single eye peering into the darkness. This time Billy had provided

three stout, but narrow, ladders, constructed of two poles nailed

together with occasional cross pieces that gave narrow room for a

foot. He set one of these in place against the wall now, grounding

its ends deep in the soft earth, so that it would remain in

readiness for any sudden descent. Then from the top of the wall they

reconnoitered the scene before them.


It was very dark. The garden was full of blotting shadows, and the

long wing of the harem lay almost in darkness, with only a faint

beam from two adjacent windows to reveal a sign of life. Those

windows were on the third story, next the angle made by the union of

the banquet hall and the harem, and Billy's heart quickened as he

recognized the location of the rose room.


"That's it—that's her room," he whispered excitedly to Falconer.


Falconer stared and nodded. "I wish that beastly hall wasn't in the

way ahead of us. I'd like to see what lights are in the windows in

that court beyond."


"We might both go and take a look," said Billy doubtfully, "but I

guess you had better make, straight for your roofs. It wouldn't do

to have us both nabbed. Do you hear anything?"


They listened, crouching flat upon the wall, straining their eyes

toward the palace. There was a high wind blowing and above them the

leaves of the palm trees were slapping against each other, and below

the shrubs and flowers were stirring restlessly. But the noise of

the wind, they felt, was helpful to cover the sounds of their

approach.


"Why can't I make my way around on top of this wall and climb on the

roofs from the start?" Falconer questioned, and Billy answered, "I

asked her that. She said it couldn't be done. You'd have to climb

through some unsafe rubbish. The best way is down and up again in

that angle that she showed me. Shall we start?"


The same impulse made both men examine their revolvers, then drop

them in readiness into their right-hand coat pockets. They moved

along the top of the wall till they reached the angle with the wall

on their right, and then they lowered the same knotted rope which

Billy had used the night before, but now another rope added to it

made it into a rope ladder. Suspending that over the top of the wall

by iron hooks, they slipped down it, each with a pole ladder in his

arms, and with another hook of iron they drove the ends down into

the earth, so that the rope would not wave out in the wind and

either betray them or become displaced.


It was insecure enough, anyway, but they felt it ought to be left in

readiness for a flight that might have no second to waste. Now, with

eyes sharply challenging the shadows, they stole along the edge of

the palace.


Staring up at the building, Billy stopped. "Here's a place a story

and a half high—you could almost climb up by those carvings without

any ladder. And there's the next higher roof back of it—and then

you must go there to the left."


"I can make it," said Falconer, surely. "Now how much time shall I

allow you for your sawing—fifteen minutes?"


"Guess you'd better," Billy reflected, and they compared watches.


It was tremendously difficult to arrive at any sort of concerted

action on this bewildering expedition, but they were hoping to

achieve it. Their plan had the simplicity of all desperate measures.

One from below and one from above they were to make their way to

that rose room and fight the way out with the girl. They considered

it wiser to come from two directions, for if one were discovered and

the alarm raised, the other had still a chance of getting off with

Arlee, and if one were trying to escape, the other could cover his

flight. They had drawn straws for their positions, and Billy had

been slightly relieved that the entrance from below, which he

considered a trifle more difficult, had fallen to him. He felt

responsible, as well as he might, for Falconer's neck.


Now he steadied one narrow ladder of poles while Falconer crept up

it and then drew it up after him; and after a few moments of

waiting, crouched in the shadow, Billy saw the Englishman's figure

reappear against the sky on top of a higher roof. The route over

the old buildings had been found, so Billy turned and crept forward

along the wall, carrying the last long ladder of poles in his hand.

It was an unwieldy thing to carry and it distracted his attention

harassingly.


"My job," said he to himself, "is evidently to make a racket and

draw their fire from below while that red-headed chap carries Arlee

off from above. Well, I hope to the Lord he does. When I think of

her here——"


But it was unnerving to think of her here, so he didn't. He kept his

mind steadily on the plan. He had reached the stone steps that led

from the garden to the harem now, and laying down his pole-like

ladder he slipped up them and turned the handle.


But the door was locked. Fearful lest the grating of the knob should

have roused some watcher, he ran down the steps and hurried into the

shadow of the banquet hall, where he stood close beside a pillar

until he satisfied himself of the objects in the court beyond. He

saw an edge of light along the crack of a closed door to the left on

the ground floor of the selamlik, and in the higher stories above

that a couple of windows showed a pale illumination. On the right,

in the harem, only one window betrayed a ray of light. Altogether

the old pile was as gloomy and gruesome as a tomb.


Billy stared across the court to where the columned vestibule,

uniting the two Ls, indicated the door. He had been told a watchman

slept there, but he could see nothing now but vague outlines of the

arches of the vestibule. To the left was the open passage left for

the entry of the automobile and horses, but this, too, was roofed so

that a black shadow lay over it. But for that watchman Billy would

have made his way to those doors to draw back the bars in readiness,

but fearful of raising an alarm, he judged it was better to leave

escape to chance and turn his attention to his entry.


He went back now for his ladder, and on the right side of the

banquet hall, up under the arched roof, he discovered the wooden

grating where Fritzi had described it. Against this wall he placed

his ladder and climbed to the top, from which he could reach up and

clasp the spindles of the grating above him.


He drew himself swiftly up to this, and the end of his pole was

dislodged by his departure and fell to the inlaid pavement with a

bang that seemed to him to carry to the farthest echoes of the

sounding court. Instantly there was an answering clatter of steps.


Like a monkey Billy clung to the grating, thrusting his toes

desperately into the first openings they could find, hanging on with

his hands for dear life, holding himself as close up in the darkness

as he could, and nearly twisting his neck off in the effort to watch

what was going on below him.


The steps sounded nearer and nearer, and a huge Nubian in baggy

bloomers and a short jacket was outlined in the court. His bare feet

were thrust into clattering English shoes. He peered about him for a

time, with one hand pointing the muzzle of a revolver. Billy caught

the unpleasant gleam of it; then the man stepped in underneath the

arches of the hall and made a slow way across it.


Directly in his path lay that fatal pole. It lay along the shadow of

a column, but its end protruded beyond that shadow and would surely

catch his eye. Billy tried to free his right hand to get at a gun of

his own. To be caught ridiculously like this, clutching like a

monkey on a stick——!


Another man, shorter and bent, in a long robe and carrying a

lantern, now emerged from that door along whose closed edge Billy

had noticed the crack of light, and the Nubian diverged toward him.

The pole was unnoticed and the two joined forces and made a slow

circle in the garden. Billy remembered that dangling rope, and with

a thumping heart he hoped that it would hang unregarded in that

shadowed angle, overrun with vines.


Apparently it did, for he heard the footsteps passing on without a

stop as he clung there to his grating, his muscles cramped, his

sockets strained. Slowly the two recrossed the hall, talking

together in low gutturals and not apparently of unpleasant things,

for a note of laughter sounded. They lingered in parley in the

court, but by the time that he thought that he could not hang on a

minute longer and would drop like a peach from the wall, they

separated and each moved slowly away. The man with the lantern shut

the door after him and all was darkness there and the great Nubian

was blotted out beneath the arches of the vestibule.


The fear that Falconer was in the palace alone made Billy desperate.

Clinging with his feet and his left hand, he drew out a clasp knife

with a razor edge and hacked furiously at the delicate spindles and

frail carved work of the screen till he could thrust one arm through

the opening. The work was easier then, but he had to resist the

temptation to seize the brittle stuff and break it in pieces, for

fear the splintering sound would be too sharp.


Torn between caution and impatience he worked on, and as soon as the

hole was large enough he pulled himself cautiously up and dropped

over the edge into the cage-like balcony on the other side. The

panel which separated it from the rest of the old room was half

open, and he stepped through it into what appeared utter darkness.


He stood listening keenly, for he knew that he was standing below

the rose room; the very spot where he was must be almost exactly

beneath that secret passage outside the panel in the rose room's

wall. Not a sound came down to him and he dared not wait longer, but

turned to the left and passed through the arched doorway into the

next great salon.


As his eyes grew accustomed to the dark he saw that it was not utter

blackness, but that some wan light from the paler night without

faintly penetrated through those jealously guarded windows—windows

not so heavily screened, he had been told, as those upon the front

of the palace, for these were upon the court. He found time for a

flash of horror at this stifling barricade as he made his hurried

way through the room and stepped out into the little anteroom

beyond.


Here he paused, for he knew that to the left, ahead of him, was the

curtained opening into the long salon upon the street, and within

that, Fritzi had warned him, a eunuch sometimes slept or Seniha

occasionally came from her small salon to play on the piano there

and lingered apparently in wait. But no one seemed stirring, and

Billy stole to the door on his right, opening on the encased stairs,

and found it locked. Hurriedly he pried at it with a burglarious

tool, and then a sudden outburst sounded overhead.


There was a racket of hurrying feet and then a muffled explosion of

a shot. A hoarse voice yelled. Another shot, and then a thud of

something falling.


Desperately Billy fired his gun into the lock. The noise did not

matter now and might serve to divert the fight from Falconer.

Throwing his weight against the shattered lock, he bounded up the

narrow stairs and raced down the long hall to the door that was

brightly gilded. From beyond, but fainter now, came the sounds of

conflict. With a heart beating to suffocation he flung open the door

and rushed into that room.


    CHAPTER XIV


    IN THE ROSE ROOM


Candles flared on the table but not a figure greeted his eye. The

room was deathly still; nothing stirred but the long draperies

fluttering in the wind.


"Arlee!" he whispered in a voice strained with excitement. "Arlee

Beecher, are you here?... Arlee!"


No voice answered. No motion revealed her. Only the candle flames

danced drunkenly in a puff of air, flaunting their secret knowledge

of the tenant they had lighted.


He darted to the tumbled bed and flung aside the covers; he looked

beneath it and beneath the couch; he sent a candle's light traveling

about the empty whiteness of the bath. No little figure, pitifully

silenced, was, hidden there. The room was empty. And all the while

that din sounded somewhere beyond them—running feet and strident

yells.


"He's got her!" thought Billy, and first his heart leaped and then

it sank. For very dear to that boy's heart had been the dream of

rescuing her himself. And then he hated himself for that base envy.

For what did it matter as long as little Arlee was safe, and that

she was gone with Falconer, the empty room and the signs of hasty

departure all spoke in witness. He wondered sharply how they had

gone and whether he had better try to follow them and then thought

it was shrewder to go back the way he had come and from below to try

to guard whatever descent they must make.


He turned swiftly and crossed to the door. With a hand outstretched

toward it he caught suddenly, beneath all the distant din, the click

of a sliding lock, and he whirled about, dropping his right hand

into his pocket, to see a pale face staring at him from the other

side of the bed.


"Not a move—or you drop!" said Captain Kerissen. The candle lights

glinted on the muzzle of a gun leveled steadily at him.


"Stay where you are," the Captain added, and Billy stayed, and

through the dusk the two men stood eyeing each with a glare of

hatred. But Kerissen's eyes held hatred triumphant.


"So, Monsieur," said the Turk. "This is the midnight call you

gentlemen pay—in the chamber of my wife."


"Your wife!" Billy gave a snort of unbelief. "She says you did not

marry her!"


"When you are found dead—if you are found," the other continued,

looking lovingly along the sight, "there will not even be a question

into the cause. You will be carted off like carrion—carrion that

prowled too near."


"Just the same you've made a mistake," said Billy in a dogged and

argumentative tone. "I'm not interested in visiting any wife of

yours. The lady I'm representing says you didn't marry her. But she

says you did keep back most of her jewelry and she's giving the

story to the papers to-morrow unless I return with the stuff

to-night."


He could not guess what impression this speech was making.


"I am not interested in your stories, Monsieur," the Turk returned

blandly. "I am interested only in your dispatching—which I feel

should be prolonged beyond the mercy of a shot."


"Look here, I'm not a common robber and you know it," said Billy,

and his voice sounded rough and angry. "I'm here to collect the

property of the lady you detained here, while she was under contract

in Vienna. I don't want anything more than belongs to her. She

left——"


"With a great deal more upon her than she brought! But am I to

suppose, Monsieur, that you have made your way here, at some

personal inconvenience, I should say, to discuss the generosity of

my remuneration to the lady?" There was a tense silence and the

Captain continued in a low, almost purring voice, "You do not

appear, even now, to comprehend the thing you have done. I shall do

my best to make you comprehend—and before I have finished it may be

that I shall have a clearer explanation of this impulsive call. You

have no notion, Monsieur, how certain things unloose the tongue—but

you shall discover."


Billy saw his white teeth show in a deadly smile. Back of him a

dark, heavy figure appeared and the Captain, without turning his

head or moving his eyes or his gun from Billy, gave some rapid

directions in Turkish and the figure disappeared. It occurred to

Billy like a flash that from that secret passage where the figure

had appeared there was a panel into the room on the right and that

room had a door opening into the hall outside. The next moment he

felt the door behind him open.


Then he pulled the trigger of that gun in his pocket in which his

hand had been so lightly resting. The Captain seemed to fire the

same instant, but Billy had jumped aside as he shot his own gun and

he heard the bullet singing past his ear, and now, with his revolver

out of his pocket, he shot again with an aim so true that the other

man's right hand gave a spasmodic jerk and the revolver went

spinning to the ground.


Across the room he hurled himself, springing from the onslaught of

the assailant entering behind him, and thrusting the cursing Captain

from his path he leaped through the sliding panel. The lock clicked

home and he paused even in that moment of hammering pulses and

pounding heart to fumble in the darkness to shut that other panel

into the next room, remembering Fritzi's warning that those locks

needed a key to open them from within. The minute's delay for the

key would mean many minutes for him.


He stumbled against the tiny stairs that led to the tower room

through which Falconer had descended, but he did not dash up those

stairs for he heard the noise of feet overhead, as if returning from

pursuit, and he darted straight on through the long, narrow,

unlighted corridor, running like a hare.


At the other end he crashed against a half-open door and fell

headlong down a flight of stairs. From his astonished fingers the

revolver went clattering and though he picked himself up, battered

but unbroken, at the foot, he dared not waste a minute to go back

and hunt for the gun in the dark. He was totally at a loss for

directions; he had expected to find himself in the Captain's rooms,

and the stairs were unknown. Now he could just make out a door ahead

of him and sent it flying open, smash in the face of an astonished

black boy who went stumbling backwards.


Out went Billy's fist and caught the unguarded chin a staggering

blow, and as the boy reeled back he flung one hurried glance about

the big, lamp-lit chamber in which he found himself, the room

evidently of Captain Kerissen, and darted to an arsenal of weapons

that glinted against the inlaid panels. Wrenching down the shortest

scabbard he jerked out a most villainous looking two-edged knife and

gripping this piratical weapon he bounded out the door, fled through

the dim hall to his right, rounded a corner, to the right again,

hearing the sounds of pursuit louder and louder now behind him, shot

through a vast reception hall and plunged down a flight of stairs.


From the darkness below a figure rose up to receive him with a grip

like iron. Billy's right arm was doubled at his side; the blade of

that villainous old dagger was pressed against the yielding softness

of the fellow's sash, but for the life of him Billy could not drive

home that knife against the human flesh. With a convulsive movement

he tore himself from those gorilla arms and sent up a desperate

kick, then leaped past the staggering man, and with the unused knife

in his teeth, he tore at the bars of the great gate in the wall at

his left. The bars were stiff and primitive and resisted his furious

fingers, and the big gate-keeper, gasping for a moment against the

stairs, suddenly straightened and sprang toward him.


"Here's one hero that didn't open the door 'in the nick of time'!"

raced through Billy's grimly humorous mind, as he dodged the savage

thrust of a knife the man had drawn and turned and scuttled across

the court with the other on his heels. Through the arches he darted

and then down into the garden, sprinting as he had never sprinted

before, on, on to the southwest angles of the wall, thanking Heaven

fervently, as every step outdistanced his pursuer, that the man had

evidently no gun.


The rope ladder was still there, blown free at the bottom now and

waving merrily in the wind. He snatched at it, dropping his knife in

his pocket, praying that the top hooks had not become dislodged, and

after him came the other man, hand over hand. Billy drew up his legs

in a horrid fear of having them gripped or hacked at, and gained the

top just as the other's head appeared below, his knife gleaming in

his teeth.


Like a flash Billy drew out his knife and cut the rope. There was a

wild yell from below and a screech of curses and imprecations

following a rather sickening sounding thud, which persuaded Billy,

peering down from above, that the victim's lungs at least were

unimpaired, and then to his great amazement a shot went winging up

past his ear.


"Had a gun all the time—too fighting mad to think of it—knife more

natural!" he thought amazedly, sliding down the other side in a

jiffy and then jerking his ladder down flat on the ground.


Out in the shadows the one-eyed man was paddling earnestly to

safety. The shot so close at hand had been his sign for departure;

he did not look back at Billy's shrill whistling nor his wilder

shouts, and as the yells on the other side of the wall were bringing

the inmates of the palace upon him, Billy had no more time for

persuasion.


Off went his shoes and out into the canal he flung them, then

headlong he plunged into the dark and uninviting water and struck

out to the right, in the same direction in which the canoe was

going, keeping carefully in the shadow of the bank, on the other

side.


In a few moments the canoe was lost from sight and Billy was left

alone, swimming between two steep walls of old palaces, weighed down

by his tweeds, and maddened through and through with his inability

to wring the neck of the one-eyed canoeist. The distance seemed

unending to his slow progress but at last the palms of the cemetery

appeared upon the right hand bank, and he struck across the widening

waters and climbed out on the first foot of the graveyard that

presented itself.


A dozen rods farther on the Arab was awaiting him in the canoe.

Billy's mood did not invite conversation and he did not linger now

for the other's explanations, but calling to him to wait he made in

through the cemetery, dodging warily from tomb to tomb, till he

reached the entrance of the main road.


The motor was gone. He satisfied himself of that, and a wave of

rejoicing surged through him. That motor was to wait till one or the

other arrived with the girl and then leave with all speed, while the

other was to be left to the slower canoe. He was sure, now, that

Falconer had succeeded in carrying the thing through and Billy's

heart warmed to him. Then, for the first time, he felt something

numb and queer about his left arm and putting his hand on it he

found the sopping sleeve was torn and a warm ooze of blood welling

through the cold water from the canal.


"Gosh, the chap winged me!" was his startled exclamation. "Feels as

if it's going to sleep—glad it didn't go back on me in the ditch,

there." Then he pressed back into the shadows for he saw a figure

edging forward beyond the corner of a tomb. After a moment's

hesitation it came directly toward him. He saw it was Robert

Falconer.


Foreboding gripped him and he could scarcely keep himself from

shouting his eager question, but he hurried forward till the two

stood face to face and then, "Where is she? Did you get her?" burst

from him, and "Have you got her? Is she all right?" came at the same

instant from Falconer.


Blankly they stared at each other and a cold sense of failure went

over and over Billy like a sea. His voice shook with this new,

sickening fear. "Didn't you see her at all?"


"Did you?" counter-demanded Falconer, and Billy stammered, "Why no

I—I found the room empty. And I thought you were safely off with

her."


"Safely off!" said Falconer grimly. "I got in all right, though

there must be a new lock on the door of that room up top, but I made

some noise about it and ran plump into a fellow half way down the

stairs. I threw him the rest of the way down, and he fired and

brought a couple of others swarming up at me but I got out on the

roofs again and gave them the slip. They went tearing back along the

wing toward the garden the way I'd come and I went toward the street

and got down."


"Got down! How did you get down?"


"Over those bay-window places," said the Englishman briefly. "I tied

that cord I had to one of the doddering old cornices to start with.

It wasn't any trick at all."


"Three stories," Billy shot in.


"And you'd no better luck, it seems?" Falconer inquired.


"No, I came up from below and found the room empty—but disheveled,

so I thought you were off with her sure. And just then the Captain

came in the panel places—just back from chasing you along the roof,

I guess, for I'd been hearing the racket—and another fellow with

him and we had a scrimmage and I got away through the men's wing."


"You're wet."


"That was a bit of canal bathing—our Arab put off with the canoe

when I was needing it badly. I left him waiting here all right,

however, and came here to find the motor gone."


"Naturally—being paid in advance."


"Only half paid."


"Half pay was enough for him. I knew it would be.... The thing was

all rot in the first place."


Billy was too bitter of soul to reply. He was remembering what he

ought to have done. He ought to have put that pistol to the

Captain's head and forced him through the palace inch by inch.... He

wondered if it would do any good to go back. His arm was rousing

from its numbness, however, and raising a little racket all its own.


"We might as well get out of this," the Englishman advised, and

Billy's reason acquiesced in spite of his rage. In silence they went

down to the water's edge and embarked. The homeward course, from

caution, was not past the palace but upstream through a remote and

unknown region where they finally landed upon a bank and struck

through unfamiliar and unfriendly looking byways toward the city.


Their walk was silent. Fierce gloom enveloped Billy; furious chagrin

bestrode him. Chump that he was to have jumped at such positive

conclusions! He ought to have stayed there. If only that second Turk

had not been coming up behind him! He could think now of a number of

brilliant ways out of his difficulties.... Morosely he trudged on

through the interminable streets, his chilly wetness like an outward

aspect of his gloom-soused mind.


He could not bear to think of Arlee. He felt now that, warned by

Falconer's approach from above, they had snatched her from her room

and hidden her away. He wondered if he deceived the Captain about

the motives for his presence. He wondered what in the world could be

done now—if all effort was to resolve itself into the futility of

an official search-party. He wondered where in all that baffling

prison Arlee was hidden.


Upon that tormenting question he unlocked his lips. "Where is she?"

he muttered worriedly. "That's the question—where is she?"


"In Alexandria."


Plainly the Englishman's wrath had been smoldering. Billy turned

upon him fiercely.


"In that palace, I tell you."


"So you say."


"And I say, too," and Billy's exasperation strained its bonds, "that

if you don't believe she was there—if you think I got up this

little party to while away an idle evening, why it was most

uncommonly good of you to come! But I can't think why you did it if

you weren't convinced of the necessity. Certainly it was not from

love of me."


"Rather not."


"That goes double.... But you couldn't deny the facts and you did

come. Because we failed doesn't change the facts at all. She's

there—only where? Had we better go straight to the consul now?"


"I think," said Falconer coldly, "that we had better telegraph the

Evershams to see if they have had any word from her before we stir

up any hue and cry."


"All right," said Billy, and then he gave a short laugh. "Lord, we

shall be quarreling like a couple of backyard dames next ... Of

course, we're chagrined. It's poor satisfaction to reflect that we

did our best—and if you are still uncertain about Miss Beecher's

danger there I can't blame you for seeing the folly of the

business."


After this effort of pleasantness Billy subsided into the cab that

was most welcomely discovered, rousing after some minutes of violent

progress to change their direction to the English doctor's.


"Winged," he said briefly, to Falconer's question. "Watchman chap as

I was getting over the wall. Nothing wrong, I know, but it feels

like—fire," he substituted.


Falconer was instantly concerned, but his sympathy went against the

grain. Billy was too stirred for consolation. At the doctor's he

refused to have Falconer enter with him.


"No use in having both of us traced if there is to be any trouble

about this," he said with decision. "Go ahead and telegraph the

Evershams and get an answer as soon as possible."


He had no earthly belief in that answer, and great, therefore, was

his astonishment when, as he was walking the floor with his tingling

arm in the early morning hours, a telegram was sent to him which

Falconer had just received. His wire had caught the boat at Rhoda

where it tied up for the night and Mrs. Eversham had promptly

answered.


"We have heard from Miss Beecher," she said, "and she may join us

later. Her address just Cook's, Alexandria."


    CHAPTER XV


    ON THE TRAIL


Breakfasting, a little one-handedly, that Monday morning, Billy was

approached by his companion of the night. The young Englishman

looked fresh and fit and subtly triumphant.


"Good news—what?" he said with a genial smile.


"If authentic," said the dogged Billy.


"Of all the fanatic f——!" The sandy-haired young man checked his

explosiveness in mid-air. He gave a glance at the bulge of bandage

beneath Billy's coat sleeve and dropped into a chair beside him.

"How's the arm?" he inquired in a tone of restraint.


"Fine," said Billy without enthusiasm.


"Glad of that. Afraid the canal bath wouldn't do it any good.

Beastly old place, that." Then the Englishman gave a sudden chuckle.

"It's a regular old lark when you come to think of it!"


"Our lack of luck wasn't any great lark." Savagely Bill speared his

bacon.


"Luck? Why we—Oh, come now, my dear fellow, you can't pretend to

maintain those suspicions now! Of course the letter is authentic!"

Falconer spoke between irritation and raillery. "That Turkish

fellow could hardly fake that letter to them, could he? No, and we

will have to acknowledge ourselves actuated by a too-hasty

suspicion—inevitable under the circumstance—and be grateful that

the uncertainty is over. That's the only way to look at it."


"We don't know that the Evershams have received a 'letter.' It might

be another fraudulent telegram that was sent them from Alexandria."


"That is a bit too thick. You're a Holmes for suspicion!" Falconer

laughed. "I believe if Miss Beecher herself walked into this dining

room you would question if she were not a deceiving effigy!"


"I might question that anyway." Billy's tone was dry. "And I daresay

I am a fool. But that dancer's story is pretty straight if she

didn't know the names, and it fits in disasterously well with my

limousine story."


"You're not the first man to be staggered by a coincidence,"

Falconer told him. "And that woman's yarn was convincing enough,

though all the time I was dubious, you remember. But now that the

Evershams have heard," and the young Englishman's deep note of

relief showed how tormenting had been his uncertainty, "why now we

have no further right to put Miss Beecher's name into the affair.

There is evidently some other girl concerned who may or may not be

as guileless as she represented to the Baroff girl, and I shall lay

that story before the ambassador and leave her rescue to authentic

ways."


He laughed a little shamefacedly at the unauthentic ways of last

night, and added, looking off across the room, "My sister and Lady

Claire are going to Luxor to-night, and I expect to accompany them.

If you should have any word about Miss Beecher's return here I

should be glad if you would let me know."


"If she is safe in Alexandria she'd never think of writing me," said

Billy bluntly. "Our acquaintance is distinctly one-sided."


"I quite understand. She was your countrywoman in a strange land and

all that."


"And all that," Billy echoed. "What time is your train?"


"Six-thirty."


"Then if I don't see you before that here's good luck and good-by."


Billy rose and shook hands and the two young men parted after a few

more words.


"You have an idée-fixe—beware of it!" was Falconer's caution,

serious beneath its air of banter, and on the other hand Billy

perceived in the cautioner a latent uneasiness considered so

irrational that he was doing his sensible best to disown it.


So Falconer took himself off about the preparations for departure

and Billy B. Hill was left to face his problem alone. Black worry

plucked at him. He did not know what under the sun he could do next.

Already that day he had done what he could. He had been out early

and run down the one-eyed factotum loitering about the corner and

under cover of a transaction over a scarab he had made a number of

plans.


He wanted the Captain followed every instant of the day. There were

enough active little Arabs greedy for piastres to do that well

and send back constant word to him. There was coming that day, he

felt, an interview between him and that Captain. Then he wanted the

one-eyed man to insinuate himself into the palace. He must find out

things. He could use his connection with the eunuch who was uncle of

his brother's wife.


So much Billy had already arranged and now after a hasty breakfast

he was off to the consul, where he proceeded to unfold his story

while the consul drew little circles on his blotter and looked out

of the corners of his eyes at this astonishing young man.


He made no comment when Billy paused. Perhaps he could think of none

adequate, or perhaps, after all, he had ceased to be amazed. He

merely said slowly and thoughtfully, "Of course the dancer's story

is all you really have to go upon. You had better bring her here."


"Nothing easier," Billy declared, and thinking a cab as prompt as a

telephone he drove briskly off.


The hotel held a shock for him. Fritzi Baroff was gone. She had gone

the evening before, the clerk reported, consulting the register, and

she had paid her bill. As he had not been the one on duty then he

knew nothing more about it. She had left no address.


Ultimately the clerk who had been on duty was unearthed in the

labyrinths of the hotel's backgrounds, but he could supply very

little further except the certainty that she had paid her bill in

person, and the vague belief that she had been accompanied. This

belief was companioned by a hazy notion that some one had called on

her that evening.


Even Billy's sense of humor was unstirred by the half-cynical

sympathy of the night-clerk's gaze; Billy didn't feel a laugh

anywhere within him. He was balked. The dancer had vanished with her

story, and that story was essential to the consul. Like a fool he

must return empty-handed with this yarn of her disappearance and the

consul would be justified in declaring that he had no actual proof

to act upon. Which was precisely what the consul did, but he

offered, impressed with Billy's earnestness, "to take the matter

up," with the proper authorities.


It seemed the best that could be done. Billy urged him to prompt

action, and to himself he promised some prompt action of a totally

unofficial character. He knew now what he was going to do, or rather

he thought he did, for the day still held its unsettling surprises

for him, and as he set forth on business bent that afternoon he

found himself besieged by a skinny little boy in tattered blue

robes, who danced around him with a handful of dirty postcards.


"Be off," said Billy, in vigorous Arabic, and the little boy

answered proudly, in most excellent English, "I am a messenger, sir.

I am the boy who held the canoe that night. Buy a postcard, sir?

Only six piastres a dozen, six piastres, Views of Egypt, the Sphinx,

the Nile, the——"


Impatiently Billy cut him short.


"Never mind the bluff. No one is listening. What's your message?"


"The streets have ears, sir. Buy a postcard?... I have come from the

palace. I brought in the bread. I—I got in under their nose while

the big Mohammed was turned away without sight of his uncle,"

bragged the little Imp. "I am a clever boy, I. No one else so clever

to find out things. The American man did well to come to me."


"What the devil, then, did you find out?"


"Five piastres a dozen, then, only five.... Go on walking, sir, I

will run alongside. Keep shaking your head at me—very good.... I

find out where she are."


"Where who are?"


The little braggart had roused Billy's suspicions. He determined to

be wary.


"The young girl with the very light hair. Mohammed send me to ask of

her. You know, sir," the little fellow insisted, hopping up and down

beside him. "Only four a dozen—very cheap!" he screeched at him in

a tone that must have carried for blocks. "I run in with the bread

and take it to the kitchen where women are working. And I pretend

make love to one very pretty girl, tell her how I come marry her

when I old enough and make enough, and hold up piece money to show

how rich I am. And the rest they think I just make game, but I

whisper to her quick how much you pay her for news of that lady

upstairs with the fair hair, and I give her some money. It are not

much, sir. I promise her to come back with more."


"Go on," demanded Billy, stopping short. "What did she tell you?"


"Walk along, sir, walk along. Just half a dozen then—very cheap,

very beautiful!" cried the little rascal with deep enjoyment of his

rôle. Billy found his hands clenching frenziedly. The Imp proceeded,

"She are much afraid, that girl, to say things, but I tell her how

safe it is an' I tell her you great big rich man who pay her well. I

make her honest promise to come back with money—and she very poor

girl. She whisper quick what she know, looking backward over

shoulder like this." Turning his face about after this dramatic

illustration the Imp caught sight of Billy's countenance, and rolled

the rest of his narration into one speedy sentence.


"She are gone," he cried.


"Gone?"


"Took away.... Take these cards, sir, stop and look at them.... Yes,

she are took away. It happen very quick; early that morning after

the other lady go in the night. Everyone much excited that night,

great noise about, and no one know just what happen. But the Captain

give orders quick, and early the motor car is ready and the strange

girl go away. Old woman go, too. Nobody know where."


"That would be Sunday morning," Billy cried excitedly. "Are you sure

there is no mistake? There were lights in that room on Sunday

night."


"I tell what the girl tell. She are very honest girl," the Imp

insisted. "She say the other lady run away with her lover an'

Captain afraid the new lady has a lover so he send her away quick."


"But he didn't go himself?"


"No, he have something with his reg-reglement," gulped the Imp

hastily, "that day and he stay and he there now—but now he sick."


"What's the matter?"


"I don't know, sir, but I know the doctor comes because she say to

me to come back and say I am boy from doctor with medicine, and if I

don't see her I must say I lost that medicine and go away, and come

again as I can till I bring that money to her. She are very much

afraid, sir."


Billy shuffled the postcards with absent hands and stared down at

them with unseeing eyes. She was gone—and the Captain was not with

her! That much at least was gain. And the fellow was here sick from

his shot hand, apparently. "I hope gangreen sets in," he said

between his teeth.


"You are pleased with me, sir?" the Imp was demanding. "You are glad

of so much clever boy? And you give me that money now to give that

girl? I make her most honest promise—and you see, sir, I am very

honest boy, I tell you all I know and I ask nothing of price yet. I

know that you are honest American man."


At that Billy came out of his brown study and praised the tattered

little Imp with hearty earnestness. He saw no reason to doubt the

boy's story. If he had been trying to invent something in order to

make capital out of him he would hardly have invented that story of

Arlee's departure, for that put an immediate end to further

remunerative investigations in the palace. Of course Billy might be

mistaken, and the boy might be mistaken, but one had to leave

something to probabilities. He was very generous with the boy, and

the droll little brown face was lined with grins. Most naïvely he

besought that the American would not reveal the extent of his

donations to Mohammed, the one-eyed man, as the boys had promised

their employer a just one-half.


It was the first laugh Billy had enjoyed in a long time. His spirits

were vastly lightened by the news that Arlee was out of the palace

where the Captain was staying. Fritzi had optimistically informed

him that the Turk's courtship could be made most lengthy, but that

had been a sadly slender hope and the picture of Arlee playing such

a fearful game was simply horrible to him. So his relief at her

departure was intense, although it complicated more and more the

hope of speedy rescue.


For where was she now? In Cairo? In some of the outlying villages?

He felt swamped by the number of things were to be found out

immediately. He must find where that big gray motor went so early on

Sunday—surely there were people who had remarked it if they could

only be found and induced to talk! And he must find where the

Captain had other homes or palaces where he would be likely to hide

a girl. And he must find out where the Captain was every instant of

the day and night.


That was the most important thing of all. For the Captain unless

delayed by extreme illness, or held back by a caution which Billy

judged was foreign to his nature, would not wait long before he

joined Arlee. He had evidently stayed behind for some review of his

troops and also to be au courant of whatever stir would result

from Fritzi Baroff's reappearance in the world, and be on hand to

disarm whatever further suspicions would result from it. The lights

in the rose room that last night and the used look of the room,

puzzled Billy, but he concluded that the Captain liked the room and

there was a good deal in that palace that had better be left to no

imagination whatever.


So back to the hotel went Billy to enter upon a period of waiting

that frayed his nerves to an utter frazzle. Inaction was horrible to

him, and now it was inevitable. He must wait for word from that

agile web of little spies which the one-eyed man was weaving about

the Captain's palace, and be ready to start whenever the word came.


He slept with his clothes on that Monday night, but he slept heavily

for he was tired and his arm was no longer painful. The tear of

wound he called a scratch was healing swiftly.


Tuesday morning passed in the same maddening suspense. Captain

Kerissen rode out that morning but only to the parade ground, where

he took part in a review with his troops. It was noticed that his

right hand was bandaged, but the injury could not have been severe

for his thumb was free from the bandage and he occasionally used

that hand upon the reins. It was the bright eyes of the Imp that

were sure of that.


In the afternoon the Captain went again to the barracks and then to

the palace of one of the colonels in his regiment. Then he went

home.


Utterly disgusted with this waiting game Billy began to dress for

dinner. All lathered for a shave he stood testing his razor on a

hair when his unlocked door was violently opened and a panting

little figure darted across to him. It was the Imp.


"Sir, he goes, he goes upon the minute," he panted out. "He is in

the station. Quick!"


Like a streak of lathered lightening Billy went for his clothes. A

centipede could have been no more active. He jerked up his

suspenders; he jerked on a shirt; he jerked on a coat; he was wiping

his face as he darted through the halls and down the stairs. No lift

had speed enough for his descent. At the desk he flung some gold

pieces at the clerk, cried something about being called out of the

city, and asked to have his room kept; then he was down the steps

and into the carriage that the Imp had magically summoned.


The drive to the station was a series of escapes. Between jolts the

Imp gasped out the rest of the story. The Captain had ridden out in

the automobile. The Imp had given chase and so had the one-eyed man,

also on guard, and by dint of running for dear life they had kept

the motor in sight until the crowded city streets were reached and a

series of delays enabled them to catch up with it. As soon as they

saw the motor stop before the station the boy had rushed for Billy

while the Arab remained to shadow the Captain and learn his

destination.


They themselves were at the station now, and Billy was still tying

his cravat. Now they jumped down and pressed through the confusion,

dodging dragomans, porters, drivers and hotel runners and making a

vigorous way past hurrying travelers and through bewildered

blockades of tourist parties. Suddenly over the bobbing heads they

saw the face they sought. A single eye glared significance upon

them. An uplifted hand beckoned furiously.


"Assiout," whispered the one-eyed man as Billy reached him.

"Assiout. That one goes to Assiout on the night express."


"My ticket? Got a ticket for me?"


Upturned palms bespoke the absence of ticket and the Arab's deep

regret. "The price was much. I waited——"


Billy was off. There was no chance of his getting past that stolid

guard without a ticket and he charged toward the seller's window,

where a line of natives was forming for another train.


"Siut!" he shouted over their heads, and scattering silver and

smiles and apologies he crowded past the motley line to the window

and fairly snatched the miles of green ticket from the Copt's quick

fingers.


He was the last man through the gate, and as he darted through the

clicking of compartment doors was heard with the parting cries of

the guards and the shouts of dragomans and porters. It was a train

de luxe where the sleeping sections had long been reserved, but to

accommodate the crowded travel ordinary compartment cars had been

added at the last minute, and it was at one of these that Billy

grasped, as the wheels were moving faster and faster. A gold piece

caused a guard to unlock the first compartment door, although it

said, "Dames Seules," and "Ladies Only" in large letters.


It was not a corridor train and the compartment was already filled,

and as Billy wormed his way, not into the nearest corner, for that

was not yielded to him, but into the modicum of space accorded

between two stout and glaringly grudging matrons, he became aware

from the hostile stares that his entrance had not been solitary.


Between his legs the Imp was coiling.


"I made a sneak with you," the boy whispered. "I say I your

dragoman, sir. You will be glad. You need such bright boy in

Assiout."


Billy thought it highly probable that he would. But the ladies

neither needed nor desired him now, and ringed in by feminine

disgust the two scorned intruders sat silent hour after hour while

the train went rushing south through the increasing darkness of the

night.


    CHAPTER XVI


    THE HIDDEN GIRL


Hour after hour the little boat held its steady course; hour after

hour the distant banks flowed past in changing scenes. Forward on

the narrow deck a girl sat in a lounge chair beneath a striped

awning and gazed out over the water. Squatting in the shade behind

her an old woman stared up out of half-closed eyes with pupils as

keen and bright under their puckered lids as the eyes of a watching

hawk.


No disturbing consciousness of this incessant scrutiny muffled the

serenity of the girl's appearance. Her hands lax in her lap, her

blue eyes quietly intent upon the view, she lay back in her chair

with as much confident unconcern as she might have shown in an opera

box. As a matter of incredulous fact she was feeling incredulously

at ease.


The terrible tension of those days in the palace was over—for the

time, at least. She did not understand this new move, she had been

bewildered ever since that early dawn, on Sunday, when the old woman

and the eunuch had rushed her into the limousine, driven her

swiftly through the empty streets to a landing place on the river

beyond the bridge, and hurried her on board this little boat, an old

dahabiyeh reconstructed and given a new engine.


The Captain had not appeared except for a brief interview in the

vestibule where he had told her that the quarantine was prolonged

and that he was going to try to escape out of Cairo where the

authorities would not be aware, and would first try to smuggle her

out of the city, too. She must do exactly as the old woman indicated

and everything would be all right.


And she had said, "How exciting!" and "What fun!" with lips that

smiled pluckily in apparent acceptance of this flimsy excuse.


She had connected this flight with the pandemonium she had heard in

the palace the night before, and she guessed that in some way her

presence there had become embarrassing for the Turk. Perhaps her

friends had traced her! Perhaps Robert Falconer—for after all it

would only be Robert Falconer's flouted devotion, she thought, that

would interest itself in her. He mistrusted Kerissen; he would

suspect.


So hope rose high in her, and hopeful, too, was this new glimpse of

freedom. Somewhere, soon, she thought confidently, the chance to

escape would come. The old woman could not watch forever. The big

eunuch was occupied with the boat. She could hear him now muttering

angrily to the little brown boy at the engines, while over the sound

of his muttering rose the rhythmic, unconcerned chant of two other

boys marching up and down the narrow passageways of deck outside the

little staterooms with a scrubbing brush under each left foot.

"Allah Illeh Lessah," they chanted monotonously, with a scrub of

the brush at each emphasis. "Allah Illeh Lessah."


"Allah help me," thought Arlee Beecher.


All day Sunday she had sat there in that chair watching the

pyramids, at first so sharp-cut against the cloudless blue, wane

imperceptibly and fade from sight, watching the golden Mokattan

Hills and the pearly tinted Tura range slip softly from the horizon

and all the old landmarks of the Egypt that she knew disappear and

be replaced by strange, new sights. Other pyramids showed like

child's toys upon the horizon; dense groves of palm trees appeared

along the banks, then the banks grew higher and higher and upon

them, silhouetted against the bright blue sky, showed a frieze-like

procession of country folk driving camels or donkeys or bullocks.


All night long they had steamed, a search-light on the bow, and

Arlee had lain in the little stateroom trying to sleep, but

continually aware of the breathing of the old woman huddled outside

against her door, of the soft thudding of bare feet about the deck,

of the pulse of the engine, beating, beating steadily, and of quick,

muffled commands, of reversals, grinding of chains as some

treacherous shallow appeared ahead, then of the onward drive and the

steady rhythmic progress again.


Where were they taking her? South to some haunt where she would be

farther than ever from the civilization which had flowed so

unheedingly past that old palace of darkened windows, south toward

the strange native cities and tiny villages and the grain fields

and the deserts. But it was all better than that stifling palace and

the absence of the Captain gave her a sense of temporary security.


Sunday had been hot and dry, but this Monday was cooler and the

north wind, blowing freshly over the wide Nile, broke the

amber-brown of the water into little waves of sparkling blue edged

with silver ripples. The river was beautiful to her, even in her

sorry plight, and to-day there were little clouds in the sky,

furtive, scuddy little clouds with wind-teased edges, and they cast

soft shadows over the river and over the tender green of the fields

and the flat, mirroring water standing level in the trenches. In the

fields brown men and women were working, and on the river banks the

half-naked figures of fellaheen were ceaselessly bending,

ceaselessly straightening, as they dipped up the water from the

shadoufs to feed the thirsty land. Sometimes in the fields Arlee

saw the red rusty bulk of the old engines, which the Mad Khedive had

tried to install among his people, to do away with this

back-breaking work, now lying useless and ignored. God forbid that

we do otherwise than our fathers, said the people.


Across the water came the monotonous chant of their labor song, and

sometimes the creak and squeak of some inland well-sweep drawn round

and round by some patient camel. She felt herself to be in another

world, as she sat in that boat guarded by that old woman and an

eunuch, a world strange and remote, yet desperately real as it

enmeshed her in its secret motives, its incalculable forces....


As she watched, as the surface of her mind reflected these sights

and was caught in the maze of fresh impressions, the back of that

mind was forever at work on her own terrifying problem. She thought

confidently of escape, not able to plan it but waiting intently upon

opportunity, upon the passing of a boat perhaps, or the moment of

tying to some bank.


There was in her a high spirit of undaunted pluck and an excitement

in adventure, which made her heart quicken instead of flag at the

odds before her. Only the thought of the desperate stakes and the

reality of her hidden fears would often draw the color from her

cheeks and stop an instant the beating of that hurrying heart.... If

those hawk-like eyes were watching then they might see the slim

hands pressed feverishly together before warning self-control turned

them lax again.


So hour after hour the boat went on. On the left now the long

mountain of Gebel-el-Tayr stretched golden and tawny like a lion of

stone basking in the sun. They passed Beni-Hassan, where a Nile

steamer lay staked to the shore, the passengers streaming gaily out

and starting off on donkeys for an excursion to the tombs. If only

it had been a little nearer, close enough to risk a desperate

hail—! But the very sight of it was comforting.


Toward dusk the engine failed. That night the boat lay by the bank,

tied to long stakes which the boys had driven in. The big Nubian sat

at one end, cross-legged, a rifle on his knees. At the stern sat a

brown boy. And so Arlee sank into the tired sleep that claimed her,

and did not wake until the warm sunshine in her tiny window and the

ripple of water against the sides told her that another morning was

at hand and that they were on the move again.


Stepping out on deck for breakfast, she found the boat was sailing.

Two lanteen sails were hoisted; a great one in the bow, a small

one in the stern, and the boat was running swiftly before the north

wind that blew fresher than ever. But the course was variable now as

the river curved and as sand-banks threatened, and Arlee watched the

waters eagerly for a near-passing boat. But when they did draw close

to a dahabiyeh upon whose deck she saw some white-clad loungers,

the Nubian gave a low order to the old woman who rose and gripped

Arlee on the wrist and led her to the stateroom, sitting in silence

opposite her like a squat gargoyle, till the Nubian's voice

permitted them to emerge.


And now they came to a city upon the right bank and the domes and

minarets, the crowded building and high flat roofs pierced Arlee

with a terrible sense of loneliness. And when her eyes caught the

gleam of flags over a building and she saw her own stars and stripes

blowing against this Egyptian sky, the tears could not be fought

back. With wet eyes and working mouth she stood there and looked and

looked. She thought she could endure no more and that her heart was

breaking.


Leaden discouragement was upon her as the boat made in toward the

shore. It did not approach the city landings; it came in south near

a shallow bank, and one of the brown boys jumped overboard and

splashed to the shore while the boat went on. But by and by it

turned in its course and came beating back against the wind till

opposite it was the city; then it tacked in to that same place near

the bank, and there the boy was waving at them. Skillfully the

dahabiyeh was brought about close to the high bank; and ropes

thrown from bow and stern were quickly staked and made fast.


A plank was put over the side and with the eunuch ahead and the old

woman behind Arlee was taken ashore and mounted on one of the camels

the boys had brought, with the old woman behind, gripping her about

the waist. The eunuch, on another camel, held the bridle rope, and

led them at a terrific pace along the river road and then across the

fields, thudding down the narrow, beaten paths, till the lush green

was past and the dry desert lands began.


Ahead of them a low, tawny mass of mountain seemed to shimmer and

waver in the hot sun, and as they drew nearer and nearer the mass

was resolved into many masses broken into small foothills at the

base, through which the Nubian threaded a rapid, circuitous way that

led out on a rolling ground. A wide detour, still at the same urgent

speed which jolted the breath from the girl and made her cling to

the carpeted pummel of the saddle with both hands, led them at last

within sight of palm trees and mud walls.


Arlee had no means of guessing whether these houses were the

outskirts of that city she had glimpsed or whether they were a

separate village. She only saw that they were being taken to the

largest house of the place, which stood a little apart from the

others and was half-surrounded by mud walls. Into this walled-in

court her camel was led and halted and jerkingly it accomplished

its collapsing descent, and Arlee found herself on her feet again,

quite breathless, but very alert.


Her fleet glance saw a number of black-robed figures about a stair;

the next instant a mantle was flung over her head and that

compelling hand upon her wrist urged her swiftly forward, and up a

flight of steps. Within were more steps and then a door. Thrusting

back the mantle she found herself in the sudden twilight of a small,

low-ceiled chamber. There was no other door to it but the one she

heard bolted behind her; there was one window completely covered

with brown mashrubiyeh. She flew to it; it looked out over wide

sands, with a glimpse, toward the right, of a mud wall and pigeon

houses. The room was musty and dusty and dirty; but the rugs in it

were beautiful, and a divan was filled with pillows and hung with

embroidered cotton hangings. Other pillows were on the floor about

the walls. A green silk banner embroidered in gold hung upon one of

those walls and a laquered table stood by the divan.


And as Arlee Beecher stood there in that strange, stifling room, the

mutterings of foreign voices, the squeals of the camels, the bray of

a donkey coming through that screened window, a sudden rage came

over her which was too hot to bear. Her heart burned; her hands

clenched; she could have beaten upon those walls with her helpless

fists and screamed at the top of her unavailing lungs. It was a fury

of despair that seized her, a fury that she fought back with every

breath of sanity within her. Then suddenly the air was black. The

room seemed to swim before her eyes and the ground came swaying

dizzily up to meet her, and receive her spent unconsciousness.


Water had been brought; she woke to find herself upon the couch, the

old woman woodenly sopping her head and hands. She smiled weakly

into that strange dark face; it was as unchanged as if it had been

carved from bronze. The business of reviving finished, the old woman

left her a handkerchief damp with a keen scent and went about the

work of unpacking a hamper that she brought in.


Dully, Arlee saw the preparations for a meal advancing. She shook

her head at it; a cup of tea was all that she could touch. A

lethargy had seized her; even the anger of revolt was gone. She

closed her eyes languidly, grateful when the old woman went away,

grateful when the darkness deepened. When it was quite night, she

thought, she would break open the wooden screen and fling herself

through the wood into the sands. She lay there passively waiting;

her heavy eyes closed, and she slept.


    CHAPTER XVII


    AT BAY


Voices sounded below; footsteps hurried; a door slammed. Then feet

upon the stairs, and a hand at the door. Arlee struggled to her feet

in sudden terror; the candle was out and the room was in darkness.

Outside a gale was blowing. The door opened, but the figure which

hurried in was not the one her fright anticipated.


It was the old woman again, bustling with haste. She brought more

candles for the table, and then a tray with a bottle and glasses and

dishes covered with napkins. Then she bestowed her attention to

Arlee, bringing her a mirror and a comb from the hamper she had left

upon the floor, and a cloth thick with powder. Then Arlee was sure.


She stood rigid a moment, listening to that low buzz of voices from

below, then desperately she shook out her tangled hair and combed it

back from her hot face. It was still damp from the water that had

been dashed upon her, and as she knotted it swiftly, soft strands of

it broke away and hung in wet, childish tendrils. She brushed some

powder on her face; she bit her bloodless lips, and stared into the

glass, to see a wan and big-eyed girl staring back affrighted.


Then the door opened, and desperately calling on her courage, Arlee

heard the Captain speaking her name and saw his smiling face

advancing through the shadows.


"A thousand greetings, Mademoiselle. Ah, I am glad to see you." A

strained emotion quivered through the false assurance of his tone.


She stood very straight and tense before him, a childishly small

figure there in the dusk, the blowing candles making strange play of

light and shadow over her. Steadily she answered, "And I am very

glad to see you, Captain Kerissen."


"And I am glad that you are glad." But his ear had caught the

hardness of her voice, for answering irony was in his. Some devil of

delay and disappointment seemed to enter into him, for his face, as

she saw it now in his advancing, struck fright into her. The four

fingers of his right hand were wrapped in a bandage and he extended

his left to her, murmuring an apology. "A slight accident, you see."


"There is so much I do not see that I do not feel like shaking

hands," gave back Arlee. "Captain Kerissen, this is too strange a

situation to be maintained. You must end it."


"It is a very delightful situation," he returned blandly, looking

about with dancing eyes. "To be again your host, even in so poor a

place as this old house of the Sheik—and the place has its

possibilities, Mademoiselle. It is romantic. Your window overlooks

that desert you were so anxious to see. The sunsets——"


"Captain Kerissen, I must say that you use a very strange way to

keep me your guest!"


"I might respond that any way was justifiable so that it kept you a

guest.... But you wrong me. Did I not bring you safely out from that

quarantine, as you besought me?" His smile was mockery itself.


"But you did not bring me to my friends. I do not like your sending

me here, without explanation," she returned, trying to be very wise

and speak quietly and not rouse him to anger. "We passed a city

where the American flags were flying over a house, and I could have

gone there."


"I am sorry you do not care for my hospitality. I did not know that

I was displeasing to you."


"It is those ways that are displeasing to me. I——"


"Then you shall change them," he laughed. "That will give me

pleasure.... But I did not come in the dead of this night, half sick

and fatigued, to find such welcome. Come, you must smile a little

and sit down at the table with me. Here are delicacies I sent from

Cairo."


Smilingly he seated himself at the divan by the table and lifted the

covers from the plates, nodded satisfaction at the food, and began

to help himself, while she stood there, motionless.


Without looking up, "Will you not help me to the Apollinaris,

Mademoiselle?" he suggested. "My right hand, you see, is not as it

should be. There is a bottle opener on the tray."


Feeling a fool, but unwilling to provoke a crisis, Arlee tugged at

the cork and poured him a glass of the sparkling water and then a

glass for herself, which she thirstily drank. "How did you hurt your

hand?" it occurred to her to say.


"By playing with fire—the single pastime of entertainment!" He

spoke gaily, but his lips twitched. "But will you not sit down and

join me? This caviar I recommend."


"I do not care to eat."


"No?" He finished his sandwich and drained his glass, talking

banteringly the while to her. She did not answer. Something told her

that the time of explanation between them was coming fast; he had

ceased to play with his good fortune, ceased to feel he could afford

to wait and look and fancy. He had come urgent, in the dead of

night. His mood was teasing, mocking, but imperative.... Slowly she

moved toward the unlatched door.


Alertly he was before her; the bolts shot home. "Ah, pardon, but I

was negligent! We might be interrupted—and also," he laughed, as if

deprecatingly, "I have foolish fears that you are so dream-like that

you will vanish like a dream without those earthly bars. Locks are

for treasures.... And now where is that welcome for me? I came in

that door on fire to see you, and your eyes froze me. I came to

love—you made me mock. Shall we begin again? Will you be nice now,

little one, be kind and sweet——"


"Captain Kerissen, you make it impossible for me to like you at all!

Why do you treat me like this? You shut me in this house like a

prisoner. If you—if you care for me at all," stammered Arlee, "you

would not treat me so!"


"And how, then, would I treat you?" he inquired slowly.


"You would—you would take me to my own people and give me back my

independence, my dignity. Then there would be honor in your—your

courtship. I——"


"Would you come back to me?"


"I——"


The lie choked her. And the passion of anger which had flared in her

that afternoon sprang up in flame again; the candlelight showed the

hot blood in her cheeks. "I shall not come to you if you keep me

here!" she gave back fearlessly.


"But here I can come to you. And the preliminaries are always

stupid—I have no desire to reënact them. I am well content with

where we have arrived. Be content, also."


She stared back at his smiling face. And all she thought was, "Shall

I defy him now, or try to hold him off a little longer?" She had

ceased to feel afraid; her blood was on fire; it was battle now

between them; perhaps a battle of the wits a little longer, then——


"In America men do not make love by force," she flung at him. "You

are mad, Captain Kerissen! You will be sorry if you go on like this.

If you wish to marry me you must give me the freedom of choice. You

must give me time. I must have a minister of my own faith. Do you

think I will submit to this? You make me hate you!"


"Hate is often love with a mask," he laughed, his eyes fixed on the

spirited, flushed face, the flashing eyes, the defiant mouth. "And

do not quote your America to me. You are done with America."


"You say that? You forget who I am! My brother—I tell you my

brother will——"


"Do I not know the risks?" His eyes narrowed. "But your brother will

ask in vain. He will not see you—until we reappear as husband and

wife. I will take you to the Continent, then I will give you

everything a woman wants, luxury and jewels—the pearls of my

ancestors I will hang on you. These have no woman of mine worn. You

shall be my adored, my dearest—— Oh, you must not turn from me," he

pleaded, his voice sinking softer and softer as he stole closer to

her. "You know that I am mad for you. You have bewitched me, little

Rose, you have made me strong and weak in a breath. I am clay in

your hands. Be sweet, be kind, be wife to me——" His hot hand

gripped her arm. He bent over her, and she sprang back, her hands

flung out before her.


"Oh, wait!" she cried beseechingly. "Wait—please wait."


"Wait? I have waited too long!" His voice was a snarl now. The mask

of indolent mockery was gone; his face was stamped with cruelty and

greed. "Nom d'un nom, I am through with this waiting!"


She sprang back before his approach, then whirled about to face him,

trying to beat him back with words, with reason, with appeal.

Insanely he laughed and clutched at her as she flew past his

outstretched arms; in the corner he pinioned her against the wall

and gripped her to him.


Terror gave her the strength of two—and his hand was bandaged.

Desperately she attacked it, and as his laughter changed to curses,

she wrenched free once more and flew across the room. With both

hands she seized the candles and flung them into the pillowed divan;

holding the last two to the draperies. Like magic the little flames

zigzagged up the cotton hangings.


He threw himself upon the fire, dragging down the hangings, beating

on the cushions, but the corner was ablaze. Overhead the flames

seized cracklingly on the dry wood and darted little red tongues

over the dry surface and a scarlet snake ran out over the carved

ceiling.


In utter wildness Arlee had carried the last candle to the open

hamper and the garments there caught instant fire. She was oblivious

of the sparks falling about her, oblivious of the increasing peril.

When Kerissen ran to the door, tearing open the bolts, furiously

cursing her, she gave him back the ghost of his earlier mocking

laughter and threatened him with a blazing cloth as he turned to

drag her from the room.


But the fire reached her fingers and she flung the cloth at him, to

have him trample it under foot as he sprang toward her again.


"Would you be burned—be marred?" he shouted at her. "You are mad,

you——"


Behind him the door opened. Behind him a tall figure appeared

through the thickening smoke. She saw a face she knew; a voice she

knew cried out her name:


"Arlee!"


"Oh, here!" she cried and flung herself toward him.


"Not unless you want another?" said Billy B. Hill to the Captain,

turning his gun suggestively.


One tense instant the three faced each other in that flaming room,

then with a sound of impotent fury, Kerissen turned and darted out

the door. But as Billy turned to follow, his hand on Arlee's, there

was a sound of sliding bolts.


"Burn, burn, then! Burn together!" called a hoarse voice through the

wood.


Hill flung himself against the door; it was unyielding. On the other

side the taunts continued. He ran to the window, catching up the

little table as he ran, and rained a fury of blows with the table

against the close-carved screen. The wood splintered and broke; he

wrenched a side away, and dropping his gun in his pocket he crashed

through the hole and hung on the outside by his hands.


"Climb out on my shoulders," he commanded, and Arlee climbed—how,

she never knew. For one instant she had an impression of hanging out

over an abyss with fire crackling in her face; the next instant the

soles of her feet were smarting and her eyes still seemed to see

stars.


There was a run, stumbling, with Billy's hand sustaining her, and

then she was on a camel, clutching the saddle as the beast rose

swiftly in response to urgent whacks, and beside her Billy was on

another. Some one on foot goaded the beasts into a startled run, and

behind them yells and screeches were growing louder and louder.


Over her lurching shoulder she had one last glimpse of a burning

building and saw flames pouring from the roof, and the room where

she had been an open furnace, and then she turned her face toward

the dark ahead.


"Hang tight," Billy was calling to her, and she saw him lean over

and lash both camels into furious speed. "Some one is riding after,"

and then he turned and shot his gun warningly into the air.


The yells behind them stopped. But after some moments they heard a

camel snarl, and knew that some one was still back there in the

darkness, hanging on their trail. So they rode hard ahead, into the

enveloping night, over the rolling dunes, with the wind leaping and

tearing and hurling the sand in their faces, as if the very elements

were fighting against them.


It was a strange chase and a hot one, pounding on and on, racked

with the wild, lurching flight, deeper and deeper into the

yellow-gray night that welcomed them with more strident blasts and

more stinging particles of sand.


"It's a storm," Billy shouted at her, raising his voice above the

wind. "It's been blowing up this way for an hour now—they won't

follow long in the face of it. Can you hang on a little longer?"


"Forever," she cried back, gripping the pommel tight and bending her

head before the whirling particles. There was sand in her hair, sand

on her lashes and in her eyes, sand on her face and down her neck,

and sand in her mouth when she wet her lips, but she heard herself

laughing in the night.


"By and by we'll get off," he called back, and by and by when the

hot, stifling, stinging, choking, whirling gale was too blinding to

be borne, he checked the camels in one of the hollows of the desert

dunes from which the wind was skimming ammunition for its peppery

assaults, and the beasts knelt with a haste that spoke of gladness.


"It's the backbone of it now; cover your head and lie down," Billy

commanded, and Arlee covered it with what he thrust into her

hands—his overcoat, she found—and tucked herself down against him

as he crouched beside the camels.


"I should think—it was—the backbone," she gasped, unheard, into

her muffling coat. For the wind howled now like a rampaging demon;

it tore at them in hot anger; it dragged at the coat about her head,

and when her clutch resisted, it flung the sand over and over her

till she lay half buried and choking. And then, very slowly and

sulkily, it retreated, blowing fainter and fainter, but slipping

back for a last spiteful gust whenever she thought it finally gone,

but at last her head came out from its burrow, and she began

cautiously to wipe the sand crust off her face and lashes.


"In your eyes?" said a sympathetic voice.


In the darkness beside her Billy Hill was sitting up, digging at his

countenance.


"Not now—I've cried—that all gone," she panted back.


He chuckled. "I'll try it—swearing's no use."


She sat up suddenly. "Are they coming?"


"Not a bit. No use, if they did. You're safe now."


"Oh, my soul!" She drew a long, long breath. "I can't believe

it." Then she whirled about on him. "How—why—why is it you?"


He looked suddenly embarrassed, but the darkness hid it from her. He

became oddly intent on brushing his clothes. "Oh, I guessed," he

said in a casual tone.


"You guessed? Don't they know? What did they think? Oh, where did

everyone think I was?"


He told her, dwelling upon the misleading details; the hasty message

of farewell from the station, the directions about luggage, the

money to pay the hotel bill. "You see, his wits and luck were just

playing together," he said.


"Then the Evershams are up the Nile?"


"Of course. They never dreamed——"


"They wouldn't." Arlee was silent. She wondered confusedly—she

wanted to ask a question—she wanted to ask two questions.


"But—but—no one else——?" she stammered.


There was a particularly large lump of sand in Billy B. Hill's

throat just then; he cleared it heavily. "Oh, yes, some one else

guessed, too," he said then. "That English friend of yours, Robert

Falconer, he and I had a regular old shooting party in the palace

last Sunday evening. If you'd been there then he would certainly

have had you out."


"So he knows." She said it a little faintly, Billy thought, as if

she was disappointed and troubled. She would know, of course, by

intuition, how the Englishman would think about a scrape of that

sort.


"But he doesn't know now," he said eagerly. "He is sure you are all

right in Alexandria, because the Evershams received another fake

telegram from you from Alexandria. The Captain was stalling them

along, apparently, keeping everything under cover as long as

possible. And when Falconer heard about that, his suspicions were

over. He thought we'd made fools of ourselves in going to the

palace."


She was silent. Looking at her, after a while, Billy saw her staring

out obliviously into the darkness; her hair was hanging all about

her.


His glance seemed to recall her thoughts. She started and then

brushed back her hair; the sand fell from it and she took hold of

one soft strand. "Look out, I'm going to shake this!" she warned,

and he half shut his eyes and underneath the lids he saw her shaking

her head as vigorously as a little terrier after a bath.


"Isn't it awful?" she appealed.


"I could scratch a match on my face," he confirmed.


"But tell me," she began again, "how did you know I was in that

palace? And I must tell you how I happened to go and how I was kept

there."


"You were told there was a quarantine, weren't you?" Billy supplied,

as she hesitated.


Her astonishment found quick speech. "Why, how did you know that?"


"The Baroff told me—that Viennese girl who came into your room."


"Why, you know everything! How did you?"


"Oh, I carried her over a wall, thinking it was you."


"But how could you think it was I? And what were you doing at the

wall? I don't see how——"


"Oh, one of the palace maids gave me a message in Arabic and I

thought it was from you. You see, I suspected—I had seen you drive

off in that motor——"


"But how could the maid bring you a message? Where were you? Where

did she see you?"


"I was painting out in front of the palace." Billy sounded more and

more casual.


"You said you were an engineer," said Arlee. His heart jumped. At

least she had remembered that!


"So I am—the painting was just a joke."


"And you happened there," she began, wondering, and after he had

opened his mouth to correct her, he closed it silently again.

Gratitude was an unwieldy bond. He did not want to burden her with

obligation. And he suspected, with a rankling sort of pang, that he

was not the rescuer she had expected. So he made as light as

possible of his entrance into the affair, telling her nothing at all

of his first uneasiness and his interview with the one-eyed man

which had confirmed his suspicions against the Captain's character,

and the masquerade he had adopted so he could hang about the palace.

Instead he let her think him there by chance; he ascribed the

delivery of Fritzi's message to sheer miracle, and his presence

under the walls that night to wanton adventure, with only a

half-thought that she was involved.


Stoutly he dwelt upon Falconer's part in the attack the next night,

and upon the entire reasonableness of his abandonment of the trail.

He put it down to his own mulishness that he had hung on and had

learned through the little boy of her removal from the palace.


He interrupted himself then with questions, and she told him of her

strange trip down the Nile in the dahabiyeh, under guard of the

old woman and the Nubian. "But how did you come?" she demanded.


"Well, I just swung on to the same train he was in," said Billy.

"And I got out at Assiout because he'd bought a ticket there, but I

couldn't see a thing of him in the darkness and confusion of the

station, and I had a horrid feeling that he'd gone somewhere else,

the Lord knew where, to you. But the Imp—that's the little Arab boy

who adopted me and my cause—went racing up and down, and he got a

glimpse of the Captain tearing off on a horse and behind him a man

loping along with a bundle on a donkey, and the Imp raced behind him

and yelled he'd dropped something. The man went back to look, and

the Imp ran alongside him, asking him for work as a donkey boy. The

fellow shook him off, but that had delayed him, and though we lost

the horseman we kept the donkey-man in sight and followed him on to

the village. I reconnoitered while the Imp stole these two

camels—jolly good ones they are—and while I was trying to make out

where you were, for there were lights in several windows, I suddenly

heard your voice and then I saw a glare of fire. Well, my revolver

was a passport.... Now, how about that fire? What started it?"


"I did; he—he was trying to make love to me," she answered

breathlessly, "and I just got to the candles."


"Are you burned at all? Truthfully now? I never stopped to ask."


"If I am, I don't know it," she laughed tremulously. Then, "Isn't

this crazy!" she burst forth with.


"It's—it's off the beaten track," Billy B. Hill admitted. "It's a

jump back into the Middle Ages." His note of laughter joined hers as

they sat staring owlishly at each other through the dark of the

after-storm.


A little longer they talked, their questions and answers flitting

back and forth over those six strange days; then, as the excitement

waned, Billy heard a sleepy little sigh and saw a small hand

covering a yawn. The girl's slender shoulders were wilting with

incalculable fatigue.


Instantly he commanded sleep, and obediently she curled down into

the little nest he prepared, pillowing her head upon his coat, and

almost instantly he heard her rhythmic breathing, slow and unhurried

as a little child. His heart swelled with a feeling for which he had

no name, as he sat there, his back against a camel, staring out into

the night, an unknown feeling in which joy was very deep and triumph

was merged into a holy thankfulness.


    CHAPTER XVIII


    DESERT MAGIC


He had meant but forty winks, but it had been dark when his eyes

closed and he opened them to the unreal half-lights of early dawn.

The sky was pearl; the sands were fawn-colored; the crest of a low

hill to the east shone as if it were living gold, and the next

instant it seemed as if a fire were kindled upon it. It was the sun

surging up into the heavens, and great waves of color, like a sea of

flame, mounted higher and higher with it.


Impulsively Billy bent over the little figure sleeping so soundly at

his side, speaking her name gently. And Arlee, waking with a start

and a catch of her breath that went to his heart, opened her eyes on

a wild splendor of morning that seemed the outer aspect of the

radiant joy within her.


They looked and looked while the east flamed like a burning Rome,

and then the glow softened and paled and dissolved in mysteries and

miracles of color, in tender rose and exquisite shell pinks, in

amethysts and violets and limpid, delicate, fair greens. All about

them the sands were turning to gold, and the rim of the distant

horizon grew clearer and clearer against the brightening blue of the

sky, like a great circling tawny sea lapping on every side the arch

of the heavens.


As they looked their hearts stirred and quickened with that

incommunicable thrill of the desert, and their eyes turned and

sought each other in silence. The gold of the sun was on Arlee's

hanging hair and the morning-blue of the sky in her eyes; her face

was flushed from sleep and a tiny tendril still clung to the pink

cheek on which she had been sleeping. Somehow that inconsequent

small tendril roused in Billy a thrill of absurd tenderness and

delight.... She was so very small and childish, sitting there in the

Libyan desert with him, looking up at him with such adorable

simplicity.... In her eyes he seemed to see something of the wonder

and the joy in his. It was a moment of magic. It brought a lump into

his throat.... He wanted to bend over her reverently, to lift a

strand of that shining hair to his lips, to touch the sandy little

hands....


Somehow he managed not to. The moment of longing and of glamor

passed.


"It's exactly as if we'd been shipwrecked!" said Arlee, looking

about with an air of childish delight.


"On a very large island," he smiled back, and felt a furtive pain

mingling with his joy. He was just her rescuer to her, of course;

she accepted him simply as a heaven-dropped deliverer; her thoughts

had not been going out to him in those long days as his had gone to

her.... Decisively he jumped to his feet and said breakfast. Where

was it? What was to be done?


Directions were vague. They had come south on the edge of the

desert, and the Nile lay somewhere to the east of them, and to the

east, therefore lay breakfast and trains and telegraph lines and all

the outposts of civilization.


To the east they rode then, straight toward the tinted dawn, and as

they went they laughed out at each other on their strange mounts

like two children on a holiday. Their spirits lifted with the beauty

of the morning, and with that strange primitive exhilaration of the

desert, that wild joy in vast, lonely reaches, in far horizons and

illimitable space. The air intoxicated them; the leaping light and

the free winds fired them, and with laughing shouts and challenges

they urged their camels forward in a wild race that sent the desert

hares scattering to right and left. Like runaways they tore over the

level wastes and through the rolling dunes, and at last, spent and

breathless, they pulled back into a walk their excited beasts that

squealed and tossed their tasseled heads.


Their eyes met in a gaiety of the spirit that no words could

express. When Arlee spoke she merely cried out, "I've read the camel

had four paces, but mine has forty-four," and Billy gave back, "And

forty-three are sudden death!" and their ringing laughter made a

worried little jackal draw back his cautious nose into his rocky

lair.


They were in broken ground now, more and more rocky, leading through

the low hills ahead of them, and great clumps of grayish mit minan

and bright green hyssop dotted the amber of the sands. Here and

there the fork-like helga showed its purple blossom, and sometimes

a scarlet ice-plant gleamed at them from a rocky crack. Across their

path two great butterflies strayed, as gold and jeweled as the day.

High overhead, black against the stainless blue, hung a far hawk.


At last the way entered a narrow defile among the rocky hills, and a

sharp curve led them finally out upon the other side, looking down

into green fields, as straight and trim as a checker board in their

varying tints, and off over the far Nile. The fertile lands were

wide here, and fed with broad canals that offered the surprise of

boats' white wings between the fields of grain. Not far ahead,

before the desert sands reached that magic green rose a group of

palms, and near them some mud houses and a pigeon tower.


"Breakfast," said Billy triumphantly, and gaily they rode down on

the sleeping village.


Back toward the Libyan hills runs the canal El-Souhagich, and as it

curves to the north a reach of sand sweeps down from the higher

ground, interrupting the succession of green fields. Several jagged

rocks have tumbled from the limestone plateaus above and increased

the grateful bit of shade which the half dozen picturesque palms do

not sufficiently bestow.


Here the runaways breakfasted upon the roast pigeon, dates and

tangerines they had bought from the curious villagers, and here

Billy, his back against a rock, was smoking a meditative cigar over

the situation. Beside him, tied to a palm, knelt the camels, and

before him, nibbling a last tangerine, Arlee was sitting.


"We have to rest the beasts a bit." This from Billy, suggestive of

a conscience pricking at this holiday delay. "And then——"


"Then—?" echoed Arlee cheerfully.


"Then, what in the world am I going to do with you?"


"With me?"


"Yes. It's simple enough, I suppose, getting back to the city—-but

if you don't want your friends to know——"


The quick shadow in her eyes distressed him. "I don't," she cried

sharply. "At first—I might have made a lark out of it—but

afterwards.... No, I don't want to go explaining and explaining

forever and ever. Can't I just reappear?"


"You can reappear from Alexandria," he said. "He, himself," his tone

changed as he reluctantly brought Kerissen into the beauty of that

morning, "has arranged it very neatly for you. You can just have

been camping in the desert—and true enough that is!—with those

friends of yours whom the Evershams don't know. Only your

reappearance has to be—managed a bit."


Very carefully she tore the tangerine skin into very little bits,

her head bent over it. Then she flung the fragments far from her

with a gesture of rebellion. "I hate fibs," she said explosively.

And then, "But I hate explanations more!" She hesitated, stealing a

quick glance under her lashes at his frowning face.


"And some people," she stammered, "might—might

not—understand—they would feel that—some people would——"


"Some people are great fools, undoubtedly," Billy promptly agreed.

But back of the some people he saw Falconer in her mind, and

Falconer's instinctive distaste of all strangeness and sensation.


"I have a perfect right to keep it from—them," she went on

argumentatively, and then with an upward glance, "Haven't I?"


"Good Lord, yes! It was your adventure; it doesn't concern another

soul in this wide world."


"You know," said Arlee, locking and unlocking her fingers, "you

know, some people wouldn't take it all for granted the way—you

do.... And it was very horrid."


"It's over," said he crisply, "except I'd like to pound him to a

jelly."


"I couldn't bear to speak of him before," said the girl, "but now

it seems all far away and nightmarish.... And I'd like to tell you

how it was—a little."


"You needn't."


"I know I needn't." Arlee's tone was suddenly proud. Then she melted

again. "But I want you to know. He was—he was trying to make me

care for him.... He wasn't really as dreadful as you might think

him, only just insane—about me—and utterly unscrupulous. But he

did want me to like him and so, when I found out, when Fritzi told

me I was in a trap, I tried to play his game. I flirted one day in

the garden, at lunch, and made him think—— You see, I had to gain

time and try to get word to people. But I hated him so I——" She

broke off, the pupils of her fixed eyes big and black with the

memory.


"You know I can't—I can't think of you—alone there," came huskily

from the young man.


"He never dared to touch me—really—till last night," she said

fiercely. "He tried, but I—I held him off. Only he talked to

me—Oh, how he talked. Like a river of words.... I hate all those

words.... If ever again a man asks me to marry him I don't ever want

him to talk about it. I want him just to say two words, Will

you?" Her laugh caught quiveringly in her throat.


It taxed all the young man's control to keep his tongue off the

echo.


"He just raved," she went on after a pause, "and I had to

listen—but last night he was horrible. I could never have got to

the candles if his hand hadn't been hurt."


"I wish I'd shot his hand off," said Billy bitterly.


"Oh! Was it you who——?"


"When we were in the palace." He told her again about the raid and

she nodded delightedly over it.


"It's so wonderful for you to have done all this," she said with

sudden shyness. "You had just met me——"


The things on Billy's tongue wouldn't do at all. None of them. What

he did say was absurdly stiff and constrained. "You were my

countrywoman—and alone."


"So are the Evershams," said Arlee, with sudden bubbling laughter,

and then as suddenly checked herself. Her fleet glance at him was

half-scared. "You—you are very good to your countrywomen in

distress," she got out stammeringly.


Billy contemplated his cigar. It was safer.


Presently she reverted to the topic of discovery. "But about Mr.

Falconer? Are you sure his suspicions are over now?"


"Perfectly sure. Or they will be the moment he sees you. You'll have

to laugh at him if he mentions them, of course;" Billy spoke with

heartiness.


"He'd hate it," the girl said musingly. "The talk and all—about

me—Oh, after being such a fool I'd never be the same to them!"

she broke out passionately.


The furtive pain was bolder now; Billy felt it worming deeper and

deeper into his sorry consciousness. It mattered so much to her what

Falconer thought—so much....


"But I'll do anything you say," she said meekly, looking up at her

rescuer with those big eyes whose blueness always startled him like

unsuspected lakes. He saw then that she meant to be very grateful to

him. Somehow that deepened the pang. He didn't want that kind of

bond....


"Then you will bury even the memory of this time and never whisper a

word of it," he told her stoutly. "The talk and explanation will be

over five minutes after your return. The thing is, to manage that

return. Now the Evershams left Friday and this is Wednesday—six

days."


"Only six days," she echoed with a ghost of a sigh.


"Now let me see where were we on the sixth day? When I was on the

Nile?" He knitted his brows over it. "Why, the steamer leaves

Assiout at noon of the fifth day—that was yesterday."


"Oh! I must have passed them on the Nile," cried Arlee.


"Maragha is where they stopped last night. To-day they'll be

steaming along steadily and stop to-night at Desneh. To-morrow night

they'll be at Luxor."


"And they stay three days at Luxor?"


"The steamer does, I believe. I left the steamer there and went to

the hotel for a while and spent another while at Thebes with a

friend of mine."


"The excavator!" cried Arlee quickly.


"Then you do remember," said Billy with a direct look, "that dance

and——"


"And our talk," she finished gaily. "And your being Phi Beta Kappa.

Oh, I was properly impressed! And I didn't know then that you were a

regular Sherlock Holmes as well."


"I didn't know it either," said Billy grinning. But he knew that she

didn't know now how much of a Sherlock Holmes he had managed to be

for her.


"That seems ages ago," she declared, "and in an altogether different

world. The only real world seems to be this desert——"


"Bedouin breakfast and camel races," finished Billy. "And it's so

much of a lark for me that I can't keep my mind on the problem of

the future. But I have to get you to Luxor by to-morrow night——"


"And I can't arrive in the rags and tatters of a white silk calling

gown," mentioned Arlee cheerfully, surveying her disreputable and

most delightful disarray. "I must have trunks and a respectable

air—and a chaperon, I suppose."


"And I won't do at that. But if you get to Luxor you'll be all

right. You can go to the hotel and to-morrow night the Evershams'

boat will get in about seven in the evening."


"Did you say my trunks were sent to Cook's?"


He repeated the story of the telegram to the Evershams. Over the

arrival of the boy with money for her hotel bill she wrinkled her

brows in perplexity. "I suppose he thought there would be less

discussion about me if my bills were paid," she said finally. "But

I'd like to get that money back to him."


"I'll see he gets it—with interest," responded Billy.


"And you——?" She looked up at him with a startled, vivid blush

that stained her soft skin from throat to brow. "You must have been

to a great deal of expense——"


"Not a bit. Please don't——"


"But I must. When I get to a bank. I still have my letter of credit

with me," she said thankfully, "but it didn't do me any good in that

wretched palace. It was just paper to them. I showed it to the girl

once and tried to make her understand."


"The first station we find we'd better wire for your trunks to be

sent by express to Cook's at Luxor—or to the Grand Hotel. And then

you can take the train straight to Luxor and buy some clothes

there."


"But the train—I can't travel in this! And there would be people on

it who would talk——"


"Had we better make it to Assiout then?" said Billy doubtfully.

"Once in the city, of course, you'd be safe——"


"How far is Assiout from Luxor? Where are we now?"


"We're Alice in Wonderland about that. Somewhere about twenty-five

or thirty miles south of Assiout, I should say. It must be

nearly a hundred and twenty, as the crow flies, from Assiout to

Thebes—that's right across from Luxor, you know."


Arlee was silent a moment. She lifted a handful of shining sands and

let them run down from her fingers in fine dust. "It's such a pity,"

she mused, "when we've such a good start——"


Billy stared.


"And I never rode a camel," she went on. "I may never have such a

chance again."


"You don't mean——?"


"It would make my story a little truer, too.... And wouldn't it be

quicker?"


"Quicker? The quickest way is to go back to Assiout and catch the

middle-of-the-night express there and get to Luxor to-morrow

morning."


Arlee sighed. "I always wanted to be a gypsy," she murmured

regretfully, "and now I've begun it's such a pity to stop.... And

I'm afraid to go back!" she cried, "They will be out looking for

us—they are probably now on the way. And they'll shoot at you and

carry me off—Oh, do let's go on! Don't go back to that city! We can

catch the train another place. Oh, it's so much more sensible!"


"Sensible?" Billy repeated as if hypnotized.


"Why, of course it is. And safer. For all those people back there

must be in that tribe of the sheik whose house I was in, and they

are dangerous, dangerous. I want to get as far away from them as

possible. I'd rather ride all the way to Thebes than run the risk

of falling in their traps."


Billy was silent.


"And I'm sure the camels could make the trip in a couple of days,"

she continued, sounding assured now, and pleasantly argumentative.

"I used to read about their speed in my First Reader.... That is, if

you don't mind the trouble," she added apologetically, "and being

with me that day more?"


Billy choked. She looked entirely unconscious, and his dumfounded

gaze fell blankly away. "There isn't anything in the world I'd like

better," he said slowly, sounding reluctance in the effort not to

sound anything else, "but from your point of view—if we should

meet——"


"Only fellaheen on the banks," she returned unconcernedly. "Not

half as awkward as people on trains."


"But the—the chaperonless aspect of this picnic——?"


"Oh, that!" She was mildly scornful. Then she giggled. "I think a

chaperon would look very silly tagging along behind on a camel....

Besides we've gone so far already. You took the liberty of rescuing

me, you know, and then the sand storm and this breakfast à

deux—What's a few meals more?"


There was truth in that—and truth in what she said about the danger

of returning to the city. They were already lingering overlong and

Billy jumped up and packed their supply of food in sudden haste. It

was folly, of course, to dream of the entire trip to Thebes on

camelback, but Girgeh was about fifty miles south, and it would be

safer and almost as near to push on there or to the next town,

wherever that was, and there get the train as to return to

Assiout....


Oh, Billy, Billy! What specious argument! And why must every bright

delightful fruit be forbidden by dull care or justified by

flagrantly untenable artifice? Who but a fool would boggle over this

chance, this gloriously deserved crown of the adventure, this gay,

random ride over the deserts with Arlee?... To her it was nothing

but a prolonging of the lark into which the affair had miraculously

been turned. Billy was Big Brother—the American Big Brother with

whom one might go safely adventuring for a day or a year.... And

suddenly Billy felt a warm gladness within him. Not even her

escapade with the unspeakable Turk had been able to shake her dear

faith in her own countrymen.... He was not man to her; he was

American. Billy waved the flag loyally in his grateful thoughts.


Aloud he said, "There's risk in trying to go back, of course. That's

what they're expecting of us. But there will be uncertainty in going

on——"


"I rather like it. It's the certainty that frightens," she gave back

eagerly. "I want the way that puts the greatest distance between me

and that man.... I don't care what else happens so he doesn't find

us."


It is utterly astonishing how unastonishing the most astonishing

situations become at the slightest wont.


Nothing on the face of it could have been more preposterous to Billy

B. Hill's imagination than trotting along the banks of the Nile on

a camel with a gossamer-haired girl trotting beside him, two lone

strays in a dark-skinned land, and yet after a few hours of it, it

was the most natural thing in the world!


It was all color and light and vivid, unforgettable impressions. It

was all sparkle and gaiety and charm. They were two children in a

world of enchantment. Nothing could have been more fantastic than

that day.


Sometimes they rode low on paths between green dhurra fields,

sometimes they rode high along the Nile embankment, watching the

blue waters alive with winged fleet, black buffaloes splashing in

shallows under charge of little bronze babies of boys, watching all

the scenes about them shift and change with magic mutability.


They lunched beside an old well, they dined by the river bank, and

then as the velvet shadows deepened in the folds of the Arabian

mountains across the river and the first stars pricked through the

lilac sky above them, they pressed on hurriedly into the southwest

that glowed like molten gold behind the black bars of the palms....

And by and by when even the after-glow had ceased to incarnadine the

far horizon and the path was too black and strange for them, they

turned off across the fertile valley into the edging desert again

and saw the new moon rise like an arrow of fire over the rim of the

world and pour forth a golden flood that lightened the way yet

farther south for their tired beasts.


Arlee rode like a fairy princess of mystery, the silver shawl which

they had bought at a village to shield her from the sun, drooping in

heavy folds from her head, its metal threads glimmering in the moon

rays.... Her eyes were solemn with the beauty and the wonder, of

the night, and the strange solitude and isolation; her look was

ethereal to Billy and mystically lovely.


But Girgeh seemed to retreat farther and farther into the unknown

south, and at last it was no fairy princess but only a very tired

girl who slid stiffly down from the saddle, and pillowed a heavy

head on Billy's coat. And it was a very tired young man who lay

beside her, listening to the deep breathing of the beasts and the

faint breath that rose rhythmically beside him. Yet for a time he

did not sleep. His heart was full of the awe and mystery of the

moonlit world about him—and the awe and mystery of that little bit

of the living world curled there so intimately in the dark....


With a reverent hand he drew the wraps he had purchased closer over

her. The night was growing cold. Far off the jackals howled.... With

his gun at hand he slept at last, and slept sound, though sand is

the hardest mattress in the world and a camel's back not the softest

pillow....


    CHAPTER XIX


    THE PURSUIT


"But I shall die," said Arlee. "I shall simply die if I have to go

another step upon that creature."


She said it cheerfully, but firmly, a sleepy, sunburned little

nomad, sitting cross-legged in the sands, slowly plaiting her

honey-colored hair. "Even this," she announced, indicating the

slight gesture of braiding, "is agony."


"It's the morning after," said Billy, testing his shoulder with wry

grimaces. "It's yesterday's speed—and then this infernally cold

night. No wonder we're lame. Why, I have one universal crick

wherever I used to have muscles. But let me call your attention to

the fact that we are in the wilds of Egypt and that tangerines are

hardly a lasting breakfast. Something has to be done."


"Not upon camels," said Arlee fixedly.


"They say it doesn't hurt after an hour or so more."


"I shouldn't live to find out."


"A walk," he suggested, "a slow, swaying, gently undulating

walk——?"


"A long, lingering, agonizing death," the young lady translated.

She tossed the curly end of her braid over her shoulder and rose,

with sounds of lamentation. "I ought to have known better than to

sit down again when I was once up," she confided sadly.


"Just what," inquired her companion, "is your idea for the day? How

do you expect to reach Girgeh? It can't be very far away now——"


"Then we'll walk—we'll walk," she emphasized, "and tow those

ships of the desert after us. That will be bad enough, but

better—what's that?"


Like a top, for all his stiffness, Billy spun about to stare where

her finger pointed. Over the crest of a hillock, far to the

north—yes, something was hurrying their way.


"A man on horseback," said Arlee anxiously. "They can't have traced

us, can they, all this way——?"


"Of course not—but we'll take no chances," returned Billy briskly;

"no more talk of pedestrian tours now!" and promptly he helped the

girl, no longer demurring, into the saddle, and thwacked her camel

into arising, just dodging the long, yellow teeth that the resentful

beast tried to fasten upon his shoulder.


They started at no soothing walk, but at a hurrying trot.


Worriedly, her delicate brows knitting, "It's absurd, but," said

Arlee, "they could have traced us, I suppose, from my telegraphing

at that little native station for my trunks to be sent."


"And mine," said Billy. "And from my trying to get my letter of

credit cashed."


"That Captain could have telegraphed to all the places down the

line to know if we'd been seen——"


"Even if we hadn't wired or tried to get money, our presence alone

and our buying food would have aroused talk. I told everybody," the

young man continued, "that I was an artist and you were my sister,

and that passed all right—but if Kerissen has been making

inquiries——"


"I'm desperately glad we didn't go back toward Assiout," she thrust

in. "We'd have walked right into some trap of his!"


"Lord knows what we ought to have done! Lord knows what we ought to

do now!"


"Just keep on going," she encouraged. "We can't be very far from

Girgeh, can we?"


"I don't know," said Billy soberly. "It may be half a day or a whole

day more—you remember how vague that old woman was last night...!"

Bitterly he added, "And I'm afraid you've got a chump of a guide."


"I've the best one in the world!" she flashed indignantly.


But her assurance brought no solace to the young man's troubled

soul. He reflected that they could have taken a train the day

before. To be sure, he had not money enough for tickets to Luxor,

yet he had enough for two to Girgeh. But Arlee had shrunk from

entering a train in her dishevelled costume, fearful of watching

eyes and gossiping tongues, and had advised riding on to Girgeh,

where shops and banks would help them, and he had yielded apparently

to her desires, but in reality to his own secret self that clung to

every joyful contraband moment of this magic time with her.

Sincerely he had thought their danger ended.... But those trailing

horsemen—"Brute!" he raged dumbly at himself. "Dolt! Idiot!"


Anxiously Billy looked at Arlee. It was an ordeal of a ride.


They had ridden on in silence, occasionally glancing back over their

shoulders. At last Arlee said, quietly, "Do you see anything—over

there—to the left?"


Billy had been seeing it for fifteen minutes.


"Another horseman, isn't it?" he carelessly suggested.


"He seems to be riding the same way we are."


"Well, we've no monopoly of travel in this region."


She answered, after a moment, "There's another close behind him. I

just saw him on top of a little hill. I suppose they can see us?"


"Probably." Billy's face was grave. If they continued their winding

path in from the desert to the intervening hills that shut them from

the Nile valley, and the horsemen continued their course along the

base of those hills, they would soon meet.


"Do you mind speeding up a little?" he asked. "I'd rather like to

cross to the Nile ahead of that gentry."


But as they speeded up the pursuers did the same, and from mere dots

they grew to tiny figures, clearly discernible, furiously galloping

over the sands.


Billy thought hard about his cartridges, wishing he had more in his

clothes. When he had left the hotel that Tuesday evening he had

thrust the loaded revolver in his pocket, but he had already

discharged it twice at the beginning of their flight.... And then he

startlingly reflected that the Captain could easily cause their

arrest for stealing those camels, and wild and dreadful thoughts of

native jails and mixed tribunals darted into his harassed and

anxious mind. As a long ridge of sand intervened between them and

their pursuers he made a sudden decision.


"Let's turn off," he said quickly, and from the little winding path,

edging southeast, they struck directly south over the trackless

sand.


"You see, they'll expect us to make a railroad station as soon as

possible," he explained, "and they are probably trying to nab us on

the way to it—if those men have anything to do with us at all." He

said nothing about his vivid fear of arrest for the camels and the

tool such an arrest would be for Kerissen's designs. He merely

added, "I think we'd better try to give them the slip and steer

clear of all the little native joints until we get to Girgeh, which

is big enough to give us some protection. There must be an English

something-or-other there.... I really think we ought to go as fast

as we can now, and when the way is clear, hurry across the hills

into the Nile valley."


But the way did not become clear. Disconcerted by that unexpected

dash off the path, and reduced for a time to mere dots again, the

horsemen, three in a row now, hung persistently upon their left

flank, keeping a parallel course between them and the hills.


The day had dawned with a promise of sultry heat, and as the sun

rose higher and higher in the heavens the heat grew more and more

intolerable to their ill-protected heads and thirsty tongues. The

gaiety of yesterday was gone; the enchantment had vanished from the

waste spaces, and the desert was less a friend now than an enemy.

Chokingly the dust rose about them, and glaringly the gold of the

burning sands beat back the glare of the down-pouring sun. From such

a heat the landscape seemed to shrink and veiled itself with a faint

and swimming haze.


By noon the flask of water in Billy's pocket was empty. By noon

their mouths were parched and their skins burning. And still on

their left there hung the hounding dots, like prowling jackals.


Anxiously Billy looked at Arlee. This was an ordeal of a ride that

tried the stuff the girl was made of. She was no princess of mystery

now, crossing the moonlit sands; she was no gossamer wraith of a

girl miraculously with him for a time; she was a very hot and human

companion, worried and tired, shutting her dry mouth over any word

of complaint, smiling pluckily at him with dusty lips from the

shrouding hood of her veil. She was completely and thoroughly a

brick.


And Billy's heart ached for her, even while his spirit exulted in

her spirit.


"Beastly hot, isn't it?" he gasped, pulling his insufficient cap

down over his bloodshot eyes.


Valiantly she smiled. "What's a little—heat?" came joltingly back.


"And rough going."


"What's a little—roughness?"


There wasn't any word good enough for her. There wasn't any word

good enough to describe such superhuman courage and sweetness. Billy

had credited all beauties with being spoiled. All he had known had

been distinctly spoiled, even the near-beauties, and the not-so-near

ones, yet here was the most radiantly lovely girl he had ever seen

behaving like an angel of grit.


He didn't quite know what else he expected her to do—have

hysterics, perhaps, or weep, or reproach him for having taken a

wrong way and elected a rash course. He had known that this girl

could be a very minx when piqued. But in the graver crises of life

she proved herself a thoroughbred. She would go till she dropped and

never whimper.


He thought of all she must have been through in that horrible

palace, and he marvelled at the swiftness with which her spirit had

reverted to blitheness again. The disaster, that might have been so

stunning, so irremediable, had passed over her head like lightning

that had not struck.... Even the horror of it had seemed yesterday

to fade in her like the horror of an evil dream. That was what it

had been to her—an evil dream. She was so young, so much of her was

still a child, that the full terror had not touched her.


They had come to a road at last, a road which seemed to be leading

in from the desert very gradually to the hills upon their left, and

it seemed to Billy that it must be a caravan road to Girgeh, and he

felt themselves upon the right track. They must keep their lead, and

when that lead seemed sufficient, they must put on all possible

speed to make the crossing through the hills into the Nile valley

ahead of their pursuers. Once more he stirred their lagging camels

into a jogging trot....


It was around the middle of the afternoon now, and it had been noon

since their tongues had tasted water. Arlee felt her mouth parched

and her tongue dry and curling; her skin was feverishly hot; her

whole body burned and ached, and her head was giddy with the heat

and the hunger. But she thought how little a thing it was to be hot

and hungry and tired—when one was free. And she drew the silver

shawl closer over her head and wrapped the silken tunic of her frock

about her scorching shoulders, and clung tight to the pommel of her

big saddle as her beast pounded on and on in his lurching stride.


It had been some time since they had seen the dots, and now the road

ahead of them, like the former path they had abandoned, was turning

more and more to the left, winding in and out the low and broken

foothills, and as they followed its course with increasing security,

Billy began to tell himself that their fears had been unfounded and

the alarming horsemen were merely following their own route south.


And then he heard a whistle.


A prescience of danger shot through him. His fears returned a

hundredfold. Sharply he scanned the way about them, but nothing was

in sight. The whistle was not repeated; he could have imagined that

he dreamed it. An utter stillness possessed the wilderness.


And then around the corner of a jutting rock ahead of them a

horseman trotted, a big black man on a gray horse, and reined in,

waiting, facing them. Arlee gave a choking cry.


"The eunuch!" she gasped out.


Behind them Billy flung a lightning glance, and over the heads of

the dunes two more riders appeared, converging down upon them from

the rear. Three in sight—how many more behind the rocks?


Desperately Billy gripped his bridle rope, and with a wrenching pull

and a whack of his guiding stick he turned his camel sharply to the

left, snatching at Arlee's bridle rope as the beasts bumped against

each other in their surprise.


"Quick—this way," Billy commanded, and with the left hand clutching

the girl's rope, with the right he wielded the stick furiously. Out

over the sand both camels plunged, goaded into wild speed by such

violent measures, and a cheated yell broke from the horsemen and the

outcries of pursuit.


While rage at such unreason lasted the camels went like mad, but

such speed could not be for long. They had been hard ridden for two

days and they were nearly spent. The horsemen behind had drawn

together and hung on their trail like three hounds, riding

cautiously in the rear, but easily keeping the distance. It occurred

to Billy that these pursuers could have changed horses on the way,

and must inevitably tire them out. And then?


On and on he beat his poor beasts, racing toward the hills that,

just ahead of them, rose sharply from the broken ground, seeking

among them some fortress of rocks for a defiant stand.


A tug on the bridle rope nearly jerked it from his hand. Arlee's

camel had stumbled; the poor thing was lurching wearily.


"He can't go—any more," the girl cried out pitifully. "He—he's

sobbing. Don't beat him—I won't have him beaten!"


"We must get there," he called back, waving at the cliff-like rocks.


"Then go—on foot. I could—run faster."


"No, you couldn't," he shouted fiercely back.


She flared. "Don't you hit him again!"


The maddening absurdity of the quarrel in the face of hostile Africa

filled Billy with the futile fury of exasperation. He ground his

teeth, glowering at her, and wound her halter rope about his

smarting hand. All his hope was concentrated upon the necessity of

winning to that rocky shelter before their pursuers overtook them.

To him the camels were nothing in the face of such necessity.


They were going slower and slower; his blows had no avail now on

either beast. They plodded on. He turned suddenly in his saddle and

saw the three riders spreading fan-shape around them, the one in the

center nearest. He whipped out his gun and fired at the horse.


His own motion made the ball fly wild, but the horseman drew up

instantly, and the other edged discreetly away. And in the ensuing

moments the two fugitives gained the base of those cliff-like hills

and perceived the dark oblong of a cave mouth.


Down from their exhausted camels they flung themselves, and hand in

hand raced to the entrance of the cave. Coolness and blackness

received them. Their eyes discovered nothing of the tunnel-like

interior.


Putting Arlee some distance within, Billy went to the mouth and

stood, his gun in his hand, peering watchfully out. He saw the

horsemen draw together for a parley, then one remained on guard

while the others circled on separate ways beyond his range of sight.

His fear was that one of them might steal alongside the cave and

leap unexpectedly into its very mouth upon him, so with taut nerves

he crouched expectant.


Behind him Arlee gave a sudden shriek.


'Billy went to the mouth, peering watchfully out'


"Billy went to the mouth, peering watchfully out"


    CHAPTER XX


    A FRIEND IN NEED


He whirled. "I'll fire!" he warned, staring into the dark, but his

eyes, dazed with the sun, discerned nothing, and in utter ignorance

he faced the black possibilities.


"A man—a hand——" Arlee gasped incoherently.


"Good Lord, what is it?" said a voice so near at hand that both were

startled.


"Burroughs!" ejaculated Billy. "Is it you—Burroughs?"


"Yes, it's I, Burroughs," the owner of the voice retorted irritably.

"And who the deuce are you?"


"Hill—Billy B. Hill," came the jubilant answer, and "Billy be

damned!" said the astonished voice, with sudden joviality, and a

dark shape strode up to them. "What on earth are you doing here? And

what about that firing? Think I was a robber bold?"


"Well, there are three robber sneaks outside that we are hiding

from, so I wasn't sure.... Great Cæsar, old scout, but I'm glad to

see you! That puts us out of the woods at last.... It's the

excavator friend," he added, turning to Arlee. "Burroughs, I present

you to Miss Beecher. She and I have been having a thoroughly

impossible adventure."


"Let's have a little light upon these introductions," returned the

excavator, and a click was heard, and a light jumped out overhead,

flooding the tunnel-like place with brightness. In its beams the

three stood staring queerly at each other.


Arlee saw a slim, wiry young American, in rough khaki clothes

stained with work, a browned, unshaven young man with sleepy looking

eyes and a mouth like a steel trap.


What the excavator saw was more surprising. There was his friend

Billy, whom two weeks before he had seen off on a Nile steamer

returning to Cairo, in tropic splendor of white serge and Panama

hat, now a scarlet spectacle of sunburn and dirt, in most

disgraceful tweeds, and beside him what Burroughs took to be a child

in tatterdemalion white, a silky, fluttering white, which even his

untrained observation knew was hardly elected for desert wear. The

little girl's hair was hanging tangled over her shoulders, and was

much the color of the sand with which her face was coated, and

underneath that coating he saw that she was red as a peony with sun

and wind. They were a startling pair.


Gravely, with unchanging eyes, he acknowledged the introduction, and

then, "What's this about robbers?" he went on. "What kind of a yarn

are you putting over?"


"Nothing I want put over on the general public." Billy was thinking

very hard. "You're going to be our salvation, Burroughs, but even to

you—well, I'll put it briefly. We were having a desert ride and

some Turkish fellows who have annoyed her before chased us. There

are our camels, just outside. And you can see one of the fellows on

horseback keeping watch. The others are somewhere about.... And now,

for heaven's sake, get us a drink of water."


Burroughs walked to the door of the tomb and looked out an instant,

then he turned and went toward the back, returning with a small

native jar full of water.


"I've no glass, but if you can manage this——?" he said to Arlee,

and she clutched the cool pottery with two hot little hands and,

murmuring a quick affirmative, she put it to her lips.


Then she held it out to Billy.


"I suppose—we mustn't—-drink as much as we want."


"I couldn't," said Billy, after a grateful swallowing. "I'd drain

the Nile.... Got a camp here?"


"Yes. You'd have seen my men any other time of day, but we knocked

off a while out of the sun," Burroughs explained. "I've rigged up

this tomb as living quarters while I'm here. Now what do you want me

to do? Would you like a guard?"


"We'd like a guard and a bath and cold cream," said Billy joyfully.

"And then we'd like dinner and donkeys."


Burroughs grunted.


"Umph—I should say you'd one donkey already in your

party—careering around the desert with a little girl like this," he

vouchsafed, and Arlee's eyes widened at his brusque nod at her. She

was staring about her now with a curious interest, for all her

aching tiredness, gazing wonderingly at the dazzling white walls

with their strange and brilliant paintings. She saw they were in a

long, deep chamber, from which other openings led to unimagined

deeps.


"I guess you never were in a place like this before?" Burroughs

inquired, and she shook her head dumbly, feeling suddenly too spent

for words.


"Can she get a rest here?" said Billy anxiously. "We've had the

devil of a ride."


"The place is all hers," returned Burroughs. "I'll send you some

food and cold cream—you mustn't wash that sunburn, you know, or

you'll be a sorry girl to-morrow—and then you can rest as long as

you like. How much of a hurry are you in?" he added to Billy.


"Well, we want to take a train to Luxor to-night. I suppose Girgeh's

the next station?"


"You suppose? You are at sea—where did you start from, anyway?"

But hastily Burroughs sped from that inquisitive question. "Balliana

is your next station," he reported. "You've all the time you want,

and I'll take you over myself. Now make yourself as comfortable as

you can," he added to Arlee, handing her a big jar of cold cream and

lugging forward an armful of rugs. "I'll be back with some food in a

jiffy."


"You're very kind," Arlee spoke stanchly, but as soon as the two men

stepped from the tomb, she seemed to wilt down into the rugs and lay

there, too tired to stir.


Outside Burroughs blew sharply on a whistle, and from the mouth of

another cave a file of black boys in ragged robes made a straggling

appearance. Burroughs gave orders which resulted in a kindling of

fire and the opening of boxes, and then he walked back to where

Billy was surveying the weary camels. At a distance, like an

equestrian statue, the watching horseman was standing. Burroughs

stared hard at the distant Nubian, then stared harder at Billy.


"This is wonderful luck," Billy said to him, very soberly. "I didn't

think of you as nearer than Thebes."


"We just heard of some fresh finds here, so I'm combing over the

tombs.... But you—it's none of my business, Billy, but what in hell

are you doing racing over Egypt with a ten-year old kid?"


"Ten-year-old—Great Cæsar, man, that's a real girl! She's grown

up! She's old enough to vote—or nearly."


Burroughs stared harder than ever.


Then, "I shouldn't call that an extenuating circumstance," he

mentioned wryly.


"Extenuating nothing! Look here, let me——"


"You needn't tell me anything, you know," Burroughs suggested in

great indifference.


"Oh, shut up!" Billy spoke with deep disgust. "You've got to help us

out of this and then forget the whole business." He paused a moment;

then, "Miss Beecher made the mistake of taking a rash ride with me.

She was traveling alone, to meet some friends, to Luxor—and the

indiscretion is entirely mine, you understand. I got her into it.

And then, as I said, a Turkish fellow, that had been making himself

objectionable by following her, got his men out after us and chased

us down here. Her trunks have gone on to Luxor where those friends

are, and we have to find some presentable wraps for her and get her

to the first train. Verstehen?"


"Grasped—and forgotten," said his friend laconically. Just for an

instant his sleepy gaze touched Billy's rugged face, then fell

casually away. "I suppose any comments that occur to me are

superfluous?" he pleasantly observed.


"Completely.... And, Lord Harry, but I'm glad to see you!"


"Same here." Burroughs gave Billy's arm a friendly grip and Billy

spun fiercely about on him. "Don't you do that again!" he warned.

"Take the other one. That's got a—a scratch."


"A scratch? One of those fellows wing you out there? Let me have a

look——"


"No, it's all right—it's nothing——"


"Let me see, you old chump——"


"It's all right, I tell you. It's been taken care of—it's just a

relic of Cairo."


"Cairo!" Slowly Burroughs let fall the hand he had laid upon Billy's

arm. "You do seem to be having a lively trip," he commented,

grinning. "Here, hurry up, you rascals, hurry up with that big jug."


Taking the large jar from them, he returned to the tomb, stopping

abruptly at sight of Arlee's weary abandon. She half sat up, a

frail, exhausted little figure, whose grace was strangely appealing

through all her sandy dishevelment.


"Some water—for washing," he stammered.


"You're very thoughtful."


"I'll have to beg your pardon," he blurted, for Burroughs was no

squire of dames. "I thought you were a little girl and spoke to you

as if——"


"It's just the hairpins that make the difference, isn't it?" said

Arlee, with a whimsical smile. "I don't suppose you have any of

those in camp that I could borrow?"


He shook his head regretfully. Then his brain seized upon the

problem. "Bent wires?" he suggested. "I might try——"


"Do," she besought. "I'll be grateful forever."


He withdrew to make the attempt, and in his place came Billy with a

tray of luncheon.


"Just—put it down," Arlee said faintly. "I'll eat—by and by."


Worriedly Billy looked down on the girl. Her eyes closed. Excitement

had ebbed, leaving her like some spent castaway on the shores. He

dropped on his knees beside her, dipping a clean handkerchief in the

jar of cold cream.


"Just let me get this off," he said quietly. "You'll feel better."


Like a child she submitted, lying with closed eyes while with

anxious care he took the sand from her delicate, burning skin. He

did the same for her listless hands; he brushed back her hair and

put water on her temples; he dabbed more cold cream tenderly on the

pathetic little blisters on her lips.


"I'm—all right." The blue eyes looked suddenly up at him with a

clear smile. "I'm—just resting."


"And now you'll eat a bit?"


Obediently she took the sandwich he made for her, and lifted her

head to drink the cup of tea.


"I'm a—nuisance," she murmured.


"You're a brick!" he gave back, with muffled intensity. "You're a

perfect brick!"


Then he backed hastily out of her presence, for fear his stumbling

tongue would betray him—or his clumsy, longing hands—or his

foolish eyes. He felt choking with the tenderness he must not

express. He ached with his Big Brother pity for her, and with his

longing for her, which wasn't in the least Big Brotherly, and with

all the queer, bewildering jumble of emotion that she had power to

wake in him.


Very silently he returned to Burroughs, and when he had made a

trifle of a toilet and eaten far from a trifle of lunch, the two

young men stretched themselves out in the shade, just beyond the

entrance of the tomb, conversing in low tones, while around them the

labor song of Burroughs' workmen rose and fell in unvarying

monotony, as from a nearby hole they carried out baskets of sand

upon their heads and poured the contents upon the heap where the

patient sifters were at work.


Burroughs talked of his work, the only subject of which he was

capable of long and sustained conversation. He dilated upon a rare

find of some blue-green tiles of the time of King Tjeser, a third

dynasty monarch, and a mummy case of one of the court of King Pepi,

of the sixth dynasty, "about 3300 b.c.," he translated for

Billy, and then suddenly he saw that Billy's eyes were absent and

Billy's pipe was out.


In sudden silence he knocked out the ashes from his own pipe and

slowly refilled it. "Congratulations," he ejaculated, and at Billy's

slow stare he jerked his head back toward the tomb. "I say,

congratulations, old man."


"Oh!" Billy became ludicrously occupied with the dead pipe.


"Nothing doing," he returned decidedly.


"No? ... I thought——"


"You sounded as if you had been thinking. Don't do it again."


"And also I had been remembering," said Burroughs, with caustic

emphasis, "knowing that in the past wherever youth and beauty was

concerned——"


So successfully had that past been sponged from Billy's concentrated

heart, so utterly had other youth and beauty ceased to exist for

him, that he greeted the reminder with belligerent unwelcome.


"I tell you it was all an accident," he retorted irritably. "There's

nothing more to it.... Hello, our horseman is coming this way

again!"


Grateful for the interruption to this ticklish excursion into his

sacred emotions, he jumped to his feet and went out to meet the man

who was riding slowly toward them, the two others in his train.

Burroughs went with him, and a brief parley followed.


"He says," Burroughs translated, "that these are his camels and he

is going to take them away. He says you stole them from him at

Assiout."


"That's right," Billy confirmed easily. "He can have 'em," and

Burroughs, vouchsafing no comment on this curious development, gave

the message to the Nubian. Then he turned again to Billy. "He wants:

the money for their hire."


"For their——! Of all the dad-blasted, iron-clad cheek! You just

tell him for me that he'll get his 'hire' all right if he hangs

around me. Tell him I'll have him arrested for molesting and robbing

travelers; and tell him to tell his master that if he shows his head

near an English girl again I'll have him hanged as high as

Haman—and shot to pieces while he swings! The infernal

scoundrel——"


Whatever work Burroughs made of this translation it sent the sullen,

inscrutable-looking fellow off in silence, his followers leading the

recovered camels.


"And may that be the last of them," said Billy B. Hill, in fervent

thanksgiving. "Except Kerissen. I've got to meet him again—just

once."


Perhaps it was the hairpins. Perhaps it was the bathed face and the

sleep-brightened eyes and the rearranged gown. But certainly

Burroughs stared in amazement at the slim little figure that issued

from the entrance, and a queer, a very queer confusion seized upon

him. Not even outrageous sunburn and pathetic blisters could hide

Arlee's young loveliness. They only added an utterly upsetting

tenderness to the beholder, and a most dangerous compassion.


And just as each man is smitten with madness after the manner of his

kind, so Burroughs, the taciturn, was struck into amazing

volubility. As they sat about a cracker box of a table at an early

supper, he became a perfect fount of information, pouring out to

this girl an account of his diggings that would have astounded any

of his intimates, and would surely have amazed Billy B. Hill if that

young man had been in a condition to notice his friend's

performances. But he was wrapped in a personal gloom that had

descended on him like a cloud of unreason. The escapade was nearly

over. The little girl comrade was gone, the little girl whose face

he had so tenderly scrubbed of its grimy sand. A very self-possessed

young lady was sitting beside him, drinking her coffee, an utterly

lovely and gracious young lady—but unfathomably remote—elusive....


Perhaps, again, it was the hairpins.


Off to town on donkey back the three Americans rode slowly, a native

escort filing after, and there in town the bazaars yielded a long

pongee dust coat and a straw hat and a white veil, "to escape

detection," Arlee gaily said, and a satchel which she filled with

mysterious purchases, and then, clad once more in the semblance of

her traveling world, safe and sound and undiscovered, she stood upon

the station platform, awaiting the train to Luxor.


Beside her, two very quiet young men responded but feebly to the

flow of spirits that had amazingly succeeded her exhaustion.

Burroughs was suddenly suffering from a depression most unfamiliar

to his practical mind, which caused him to moon about his work for

days and made his depleted jar of cold cream a wincing memory, and

Billy was increasingly glum.


It was all over now. The girl, who for two winged days had been so

magically his gypsy comrade, was returning to her own world, the

world in which he played so infinitesimal a part. For very pride's

sake now he could never force himself upon her ... as he might

before ...


He stared down at her eagerly, hopefully, for a sign of regret at

the ending of this strange companionship, much as a big Newfoundland

might watch for a caress from a cherished but tyrannic hand, but not

a scrap of regret was evidenced. She was as blithe as a cricket. Her

only pang was for discovery.


"You're sure," she murmured as Burroughs left them to interview the

station clerk, "you're sure they'll never know?"


"I'm positive," he stolidly responded. "Just stick to your story."


"The Evershams won't question—they are never interested in other

people," she mused, with thankfulness. "But Mr. Falconer——"


"Won't have a doubt," said Billy firmly. His gloom closed in thickly

about him.


It was a local, a train of corridor compartments. In one, marked

"Ladies Alone," Arlee was ensconced, with an Englishwoman and her

maid, and two pleasant German women, and in another Billy B. Hill

sat opposite some young Copts and lighted pipe after pipe. When the

train started out on the High Bridge across the Nile to the eastern

bank, he came out in the corridor to look out the wide glass windows

there, and found Arlee beside him.


"How do you do?" she said brightly. "How nice to meet accidentally

like this—you see, I'm rehearsing my story," she added under her

breath.


"Let's see if you have it straight," he told her.


"I arrive on a local which left Cairo this morning.... Did I come

alone?"


"You'd better invent some nice traveling friend——"


She shook her head in flat refusal. "I won't. I'm not equal to

inventing anything. It's bad enough now to—to tell the necessary

lies I have to." The brightness left her face looking suddenly wan

and sorry. "I suppose it's part of my—punishment—for my dreadful

folly," she said in a low tone.


"It's just part of the coin the world has to be paid in for its

conventions," Billy quickly retorted. "Don't let it worry you like

that—in a day no one will think to question you."


"I know—but—it's having the memory always there. Always knowing

that there is something I can't be honest about—something secret

and dreadful——"


She was staring unseeingly out the window, her soft lips twitching.


"The Egyptians were a most sensible people," said Billy. "They drew

up a list of commandments against the forty-two cardinal sins, and

one of them was this, 'Thou shalt not consume thy heart.' That is a

religious law against regret—vain, unprofitable, morbid,

devastating regret. And you must take that law for your own."


"Th—thank you." The low voice was suspiciously wavery. "I—you see,

I haven't had time to think about it till just now—we've been going

so fast——"


"And the best thing that could have happened. And now that you have

the time to think, you mustn't think weakly. It was just a

nightmare. And it's over."


"Just a nightmare.... And it's over," she repeated. Her eyes lifted

to Billy's in a look of ineffable softness and wonder. "It's

over—because you came."


"I want you to forget that." The young man spoke with cold curtness

in his effort to combat the wild temptation of that moment. "I only

did what anyone else in my place would have done—to have

accomplished it is all the gratitude I want. Please don't speak of

it to me again. You must forget about it."


"Forget—as if I could help being grateful as long as I live!"


"But I don't want you to be grateful. It—it's obnoxious to me!"


She was as blankly hurt as a slapped child. Then she looked away, a

little pulse in her throat beating fast. "Then I won't—try to thank

you," she answered in a very small voice, and stared harder and

harder out the window.


Billy felt that he had accomplished a tremendous stride. "A feeling

of obligation kills a friendship," he told her didactically, "and I

want you to be really my friend."


"I am." Her voice was distinct, though queerly lack-luster. And she

did not look at him again.


He went on: "The Evershams will be in on the boat about seven. From

the station I'll take you straight to the boat, where your stateroom

is surely being kept for you. Then to-morrow your trunks will arrive

from Cook's, and by the time you are through resting, you will be

ready to sally out and meet the world.... I hope my own trunk will

make its appearance, too," he added. "I telegraphed the hotel to

pack my things and send them on."


She made no comment on the obvious haste with which he had left

Cairo. She said slowly, "I want to do a little mathematics now. What

is the shocking sum I owe you?"


He shut his lips in an obstinate line. After a moment she added, "I

can't take that, you know."


It struck him as a trifle ludicrous that dollars were so important

among all the rest, but unwillingly enough he understood.


"Won't you just let it stand as it is?" he said under his breath.

"Let me have the whole thing—please."


"I can't."


"You mean you won't?"


"I can't," she repeated inflexibly, and then, with a childish flash,

"Since you dislike me to feel grateful—I should think you would be

glad to let me reduce the debt."


"All right." He spoke gruffly. "Then you owe me what you spent just

now and what your railroad ticket cost. Not a cent more. For what

went before I am absolutely responsible, and I decline to let you

pay my debts."


This time he was inflexible. She repeated, with a spark of

resentment, "It's not fair to let you pay so much——"


"It was my adventure," said Billy firmly.


She said, "Very well," in a voice that puzzled him. He felt she

was annoyed. And he realized more than ever that he could never

take advantage of her indebtedness to make her pay with her

companionship. It was becoming a queer tangle.... He felt they had

suddenly slipped out of tune.... She seemed to be escaping

him—withdrawing ...


He wondered, very unhappily, with no fine glow of altruism at all,

if he had rescued her for another man. Those things happened, they

happened with dismal frequency. Billy distinctly recalled the

experience of a college friend who had carried a girl out of a

burning hotel, to have her wildly embrace an unstirring youth below.

Yes, such things happened. But he had never contemplated having

anything like that happen to him.


He contemplated it now, however, contemplated it long and bitterly,

when Arlee had gone back to her compartment and he sat silent in his

beside the chattering Copts while the train rattled on and on. There

would be three days at Luxor before the boat proceeded upon its

southern journey. And then——


Three days.... Three miserable, paltry, insufficient days, blighted

by the chaperoning Evershams.... Frantically he hoped against his

dark foreboding that one menace at least might be averted—that by

now Luxor would have ceased to shelter a certain sandy-haired young

Englishman.


    CHAPTER XXI


    CROSS PURPOSES


Luxor was warm and drowsy with afternoon sun. Motionless the fronds

of the tall palms along the water front; motionless the columns of

the temple reflected in the blue Nile. Even the almost continuous

commotion of the landing stage was stilled.


The two big Nile steamers, of rival lines, lay quietly at rest,

emptied of their tourists, and on the embankment the dragomans, the

donkey boys, the innumerable venders, were lounging in the shade at

dominoes or dice.


In the big white hotels facing the river many drawn blinds spoke of

napping travelers, and in the shade of the garden of the Grand other

travelers were whiling away the listless inertia of the hour before

tea.


"I suppose it's quite too early?" murmured a girl at one of the

tables, in the shade of a big acacia. Her companion, fussing with a

pastel sketch, answered absently, without looking up, "Oh, quite,"

and then with a note of brisker attention, "I thought we were

waiting for Robert?"


"Do you think he'll be back? It's such a trip to the Tombs of the

Kings, you know!"


"To be sure he'll be back!" Miss Falconer spoke with asperity. "And

why he wanted to go over it again—it's odd you didn't care to go,

too, Claire," she added, most inconsequently. "It was such an

excellent opportunity—and you had already spoken of wishing to go

again."


"But not so exhaustively. They are doing the entire programme. I

only wanted some particular things."


"You could have done them."


"And it was hot."


"It must have been just as hot in the bazaars with Mr. Hill."


"Was it?"


This was purposeful vagueness and Miss Falconer's crayon snapped.

She made a sound of annoyance, then began gathering her sketching

things tidily together. Presently, "He's rather an agreeable person,

that young American, after all," she cannily observed.


"Why, after all?" Lady Claire was implacably aloof.


"Well, first impressions, you know——"


"My first impressions of Mr. Hill were very delightful." The

English girl laughed softly, her eyes full of reminiscent amusement.

"He was a deus ex machina to me—I quite jumped at him, I assure

you!"


"You don't have to assure me!" was the elder lady's unspoken

comment. She had been in a state of chronic irritation, ever since

that Friday noon when Billy B. Hill's tall figure had appeared in

the hotel dining room. And hurrying Claire away from the

conversation he was promptly evoking, she had encountered Arlee

Beecher and the Evershams streaming with the other passengers from

their boat to see the temple of Luxor, a wonderfully gay and excited

Arlee, so radiant in the happiness of her own safe world again that

she was bright gladness incarnate.... Instantly Robert had reverted

to his alarming infatuation ... and Lady Claire had most shamelessly

welcomed the American. It was all unspeakably annoying....


Aloud Miss Falconer observed, "I wonder what brought Mr. Hill back

to the Nile."


"I wonder," said Lady Claire pleasantly. "But it makes it very nice

for us, doesn't it?" she continued amiably. "He knows quite

everything about temples."


"And particularly nice for Miss Beecher—though I can't say she is

treating him very well. However, that may be their way. 'Romance

apart from results,' was, I believe, his phrase."


Lady Claire was silent. But not overlong. "You really think——?"

she suggested tranquilly.


"He came on the same train."


"Coincidence. He mentioned he did not see her in the train till

Balliana."


"Umph!" Miss Falconer drew out of her bag the especial knitting

which she reserved for the Sabbath, and her fingers flew with

expressive spirit. "It's scandalous," she said at length. "Girls

gadding about the face of the earth—picking up chaperons when they

remember them."


"It's their way, you know."


"Oh, yes, it's their way. And their men seem to like it. Mr. Hill

didn't seem to consider it even unusual.... But as I said, he's

hardly a judge," Miss Falconer went on unsparingly. "The man's

bewitched. He never takes his eyes off her."


"I'm sure I don't blame him." Lady Claire's tone was most

successfully admiring. "She's too wonderful, isn't she, with those

great blue eyes and that astonishing hair! I'm sure Robert is

bewitched, too!"


"Nonsense!" But Miss Falconer's tone was too vigorous, betraying the

effort to rout a palpable enemy. "What nonsense!" she repeated.

"He's civil—naturally—when you haven't a moment for him. The boy

has pride. Too much." The knitting needles clicked warningly.


"Civil!" The girl's low laughter was mocking. "Dear Miss Falconer,

you are such an euphuist!"


Miss Falconer looked up, a trifle startled. Her young charge was

more than a match for her in irony, but the elder lady did not lack

for solid perseverance, and she charged on undeterred.


"Of course the girl's pretty—too pretty. And Robert's a man—he has

eyes in his head and likes to please them. And she knows who he is

and draws him on."


"I don't think Miss Beecher cares a twopence who Robert is," said

Lady Claire honestly. "When I told her he was going to stand for

Roxham she answered that she had a very poor opinion of M.P.s—from

reading Mrs. Ward. I can't quite see what she meant—but as for

her drawing him on, a moment ago, dear, you were accusing her of

luring Mr. Hill back from Cairo."


"I said he followed. I daresay she lured, too. The second

string——"


"Then it's quite nice of me, isn't it, to carry off her second

string to the bazaars and prevent her playing him against Robert!"


Lady Claire laughed mischievously, in a flight of daring so foreign

to her usual reticence that Miss Falconer grimly perceived that she

was changed indeed. She thought helplessly that it was a great pity

that young people couldn't be treated as the children they

were—smacked and made to do what was best for them.


"And after all this dreadful gossiping how can we face our guests at

tea?" the girl continued in mock chiding.


"If they are much later we shall not be facing them at all," the

older woman declared. "I shall certainly have my tea at the proper

time."


The sight of an Arab servant with a tray of dishes had stirred her

to this declaration, and promptly she gave her order. In the middle

of it, "I'm always late!" said a merry voice, and little Miss

Beecher and Falconer were standing on the grass beside them.


"This time we had no following engagement," said Miss Falconer,

unpleasantly reminiscent of another tea time in Cairo, ten days

before, but even with her resentment of this American girl's

intrusion into her long-cherished plans, she could not prevent the

softening of her regard as she gazed upon her.


"You don't look as if you had been riding very hard at the Tombs of

the Kings," she observed, in reluctant admiration.


"Oh, but we have! We did quite a lot of Tombs—not anything like

thoroughly, of course!—and then we rode back early and made

ourselves tidy for your tea party," Arlee blithely explained, and

Miss Falconer perceived that her brother Robert had returned to the

hotel without seeking them out, had arrayed himself in fresh white

flannels and returned to the boat to escort Miss Beecher across the

road into the hotel garden.


Absently she sighed. Her eyes fell away from the peach-blossom

prettiness of Arlee's lovely face to the subtle simplicity of her

white frock of loosely woven silk, and she wondered if that heavy

embroidery meant money—or merely spending money. And then she

looked across at Lady Claire, and sighed again for her dream of an

aristocratic alliance.


"Mrs. Eversham—?" she thought to inquire.


"They're having the vicar—or is it the rector?—to tea. They asked

him this morning before your message came," Arlee explained. She did

not explain that the vicar, or the rector, had imagined, in

accepting, that she, too, was to be of that tea party on the boat

and was even now inquiring zealously of her of the Evershams.


"Here's Mr. Hill," said Lady Claire.


Miss Falconer stirred; there was room for the fifth chair between

her and Arlee. Lady Claire also stirred; there was room between her

and Robert Falconer. And there Billy B. Hill seated himself after a

general exchange of greetings.


"How were the bazaars?" said Arlee gaily across the table.


"You mean the department store of Mr. Isaac Cohen," Billy laughed

back. "They are all under him, you know."


"Not really!" Falconer exclaimed, in disillusionment. "It rather

takes it out, doesn't it, to know it is so commercialized."


"What did you expect—it is the twentieth century," Miss Falconer

retorted, putting aside her knitting as the tea things arrived.


"Sometimes it is," said Arlee.


"I think it's more so than ever, here," declared Lady Claire.

"Egypt's so frightfully civilized——"


"Not when you're camping in the desert."


Again that funny little smile flitted over Arlee's face; not once

did she glance at Billy, but for all her air of unconsciousness he

felt that she was subtly sharing her thoughts with him and a quick

spark of gladness flashed in him.


Those had been three horrible days for Billy B. Hill.


Friday morning he had been practically a prisoner until his trunks

had arrived. He had emerged upon a spectacle of England

triumphant—Robert Falconer escorting Arlee to the temple of Luxor.

Later that afternoon he had called upon Arlee upon the boat to find

Falconer still there, and the Evershams very much so.


Robert Falconer had accompanied him back to the hotel. There was

something that he wanted to ask, and he asked it bluntly, but with

embarrassment. Had Billy said anything at all to Arlee of that

nonsense at the palace?


Here was a contingency for which Billy was not provided. He made no

provisions for this with Arlee.


"Have you?" he parried.


"Not a word," said the young Englishman. "We've not mentioned the

fellow's filthy name. But I wondered——"


"I did tell her we got worried one night, and tried to get into his

palace like a pair of brigands," Billy answered slowly.


"She must have thought us great fools," the sandy-haired young man

replied disgustedly. Clearly he felt that Billy had flourished this

story before Arlee to appear romantic, and he winced at its

absurdity.


"Oh, no—she just thought of it as a lark on our part," Billy went

on. "I didn't let her in for the horrible details—I don't think

she's likely to mention it to you. Or you to her," he added.


"Rather not." The young Englishman was emphatic. "I'm sorry you said

anything about it." Then he looked at Billy, a crinkle of amusement

in his eyes. "Rather a sell, you know—what?"


"I should say so!" returned Billy, with a hearty appearance of

chagrin, and a laugh cemented the understanding.


That was all between them concerning the escapade.


Billy had raced back to the boat, and secured an earnest fifteen

minutes with Arlee, who promised unlimited care, and then forced

upon him the wretched sovereigns that she owed. She was feeling

desperately spent and tired after her day of excitement, and

declared herself unequal to the dance upon the boat that evening.

Anxiously Billy had urged her to rest, and he spent a drifting and

distracted evening roaming alone in the temple of Luxor listening

to the distant music from the boat—thinking of Arlee.... Later he

had learned that she remained up for at least two dances with

Falconer.


So much for Friday. Saturday had been worse. Arlee had said on

Friday night that she would join the passengers in the all-day

excursion to the Tombs of the Kings, and Billy had somehow found

himself in an arrangement with Lady Claire and Falconer to go with

them. Then Arlee had not gone. Mrs. Eversham reported that she had a

headache, and Falconer had very promptly dropped out of the party,

leaving Billy with Lady Claire upon his hands, and so he went, and

he and Lady Claire and the Evershams and about sixty other

passengers had a brisk and busy day of it. When he returned just

before dinner he saw Arlee, apparently headacheless, upon the deck

of the steamer, chatting to Falconer.


That night she had attended the dance at the hotel under Miss

Falconer's wing. Billy had danced with her twice, and between times

his pride had kept him aloof—she might just have made one sign! But

though her bright friendliness was ever responsive; though she was

instantly, submissively, ready to accept his invitations or fulfill

his requests, he felt that there was something strangely lacking.


The gay spark of her coquetry was gone; she did not tease or play

with him; animated as she was in company, when they were alone

together a constraint fell upon her.


Miserably he felt that he reminded her of unhappy scenes and that

she would be secretly relieved when he was gone.


So now he was absurdly glad to hear her declare, in answer to Lady

Claire's questionings, "Oh, but the desert is wonderful! I loved it

in spite of——"


"In spite of—?" Lady Claire echoed.


"The sand," said Arlee promptly. But under her lashes, her eyes

came, at last, half-scared, to Billy's face.


"But the sand is the desert," Lady Claire was murmuring.


"It's only part of it," Billy took it upon himself to answer. "Space

is the biggest part—and then color. And sometimes—heat."


"You spent quite a time on the desert edge with some excavators,

didn't you?" said the English girl, and Billy fell into talk with

her about his friend's work, and Falconer and his sister engrossed

Arlee.


And to-night was the very last night of her stay at Luxor. To-morrow

the boat would take her on out of his life—unless he pursued her

along the Nile, a foolish, unwanted intruder.... The three days here

had all slipped from his clumsy grasp—they seemed to have put a

widening distance between them.... He heard Falconer calculating

that the boat would touch again at Luxor for the next Friday night.

There seemed to be talk of a masked ball....


Billy leaned suddenly across the table.


"You have forgotten it's the best of the moon to-night?" he asked.

"You must let me take you to see it on Karnak."


Falconer gave him a very blank look.


"We've already planned for that," said he.


"We'll all go," cried Arlee, with instant pleasantness. "We mustn't

miss it for anything."


"You haven't seen the moon on the temple yet?" Billy inquired of

Lady Claire in the pause that ensued.


"Only once—four nights ago. But it wasn't full then."


Billy remembered that moon acutely. It had lighted two fugitives

across a waste of sand. He saw a little figure swaying rhythmically

high upon a camel, a quaint, old-world figure in misty white, with a

shimmering silver veil—like Rebecca coming across the desert, he

thought oddly. Then he looked up and saw a most modern figure in

white across the table, nibbling a cress sandwich, and laughing at

some jest of the Englishman's....


With a start he realized that Lady Claire was waiting for an answer.


"I beg your pardon. You asked——?"


"If you had seen the temple in moonlight, Mr. Hill."


"Not Karnak—only Luxor—night before last."


"Only Luxor!" The girl beside him laughed. "How spoiled you are, Mr.

Hill! Only Luxor!"


It came to Billy, with the force of revelation, that it was going to

be only a great many things for him after this.... Those wild days

in the desert had seen to that, with devastating completeness....

Girls were only other girls—and delight in them a lost word. This

charming one beside him, with the friendly eyes where a faint shadow

of wistfulness underlay the surface brightness, was only Lady

Claire....


He wondered if he was going on like this forever. He wondered if he

was everlastingly to carry this memory about with him, like a

bullet.... Suddenly he felt enraged at himself, at his dumb pain and

useless longings, and with a stanch semblance of animation he flung

himself into the flow of talk which this pretty English girl was so

ready to offer him.


    CHAPTER XXII


    UPON THE PYLON


Two miles of Sphinxes in the moonlight—a double row of them on each

side of the way from the temple of Luxor—and then a towering pylon

overhead. Karnak was reached.


Out of the victoria jumped two young men in evening clothes, one

sandy-haired with a slight moustache, the other black-haired and

clean shaven, and handed out three ladies. The first lady was

middle-aged and haughty featured, in a black evening gown overhung

with a black and gold Assiout shawl; the second was a tall girl in a

rose cloak, the third was a small girl, and her cloak was a delicate

blue.


There was a pause at the pylon for the presentation of the little

red entrance books, and then the gate closed behind them, and the

five moved cautiously forward into the shadowy dark of the confusion

of the ruins. Beside the blue-cloaked girl bent the sandy-haired

young man; the black-haired young man was between the rose-cloaked

girl and the lady with the Roman nose.


"You must be our dragoman, Mr. Hill; I understand you are up on all

this," said the lady, adhering closely to his side. "Where are we

now?"


"Temple of Khonsu," said Billy with bitter brevity. Ahead of them

Arlee's blonde head was uptilted toward Falconer's remarks.


"Khonsu? I never heard of him! Or is it her?" Lady Claire laughingly

demanded.


"Khonsu is the son of the god, Amon, or Amon-Ra, and the goddess,

Mut, and so is the third person of the trinity of Thebes," Billy

pedagogically recited, his eyes on the little white shoes ahead

picking their delicate way over the fallen stones. "This temple at

Karnak is the temple of the god Amon, and so it was natural for old

Rameses the third to put the temple to Khonsu under the father's

wing like this—but it spoils the effect of the entrance from this

pylon. You don't get Karnak's bigness at a burst—but wait till you

reach the court ahead. Then you'll see Karnak."


And then they did see it—as much as one view can give of that vast

desolation. Ahead of them, shadowy and mysterious in the velvet dark

and silver pallor of the stars, loomed the columns of the great

court, huge monoliths that dwarfed to pigmies the tiny groups of

people dotting the ground about them, trying to say something

appropriate.


The place had been made for dead and gone gods, giants of gods, and

their spirits stalked now through its waste spaces, dominating and

ironic. There was an air about the place that seemed to scorn the

facile awe it woke in the breasts of the beholders and that fleered

at the human banalities upon their lips.


"There are no words for a spot like this," said a voice near them.


"Silence is fittest," corroborated a second voice.


"Thomas Hardy once said, speaking of the heavens," said the first

voice again, "'There is a size at which dignity begins; farther on

there is a size at which grandeur begins; farther on there is a size

at which solemnity begins; farther on a size at which awfulness

begins; farther on a size at which ghastliness begins.' Surely that

was written unknowingly for this temple of Karnak?"


A fluttering murmur from the group confirmed this thought.


"Nice little speech," said Falconer in an undertone.


The second voice was raised a trifle resentfully. "Yet was not the

very pith of it spoken by Ruskin when he stood upon this identical

spot? His words were these, 'At last size tells!'"


Another murmur agreed that it was indeed the pith.


"That's Clara Eversham," said Arlee under her breath. "They came

over early with some people from the boat."


"She must be frightfully up on the guide books," muttered Falconer.


"She's a miner in them," Arlee laughed, as they made their way

over the rubbishy ground where great beams of stone and fallen

statues lay half-buried in the sands.


"They must be very glad to have you back again with them," Falconer

told her, trying hard to keep their progress ahead of the others.


"Oh, I don't know!" Honest dubiety spoke in Arlee's tone. "They

have mentioned twice how convenient it was to use my stateroom!"


"They felt very badly when you ran away from them in Cairo."


"I was shockingly sudden about that," owned the girl lightly, "but

the chance came—Are we going to climb the great pylon now?"


"It will be a jolly high place to see the moon rise."


It was a jolly high place to see the moon rise, and to see all

Karnak, and all Luxor, with its high Moslem minaret towering over

its crumbling columns, and to see the dark and distant country with

its tiny hamlets crouching under humbler mosques and lonely palms,

and on the other side the wide and winding Nile with the shadowy

cliffs of Thebes beyond. It gave Arlee the dizzying sensation of

being suspended between heaven and earth, so high was she above

those far-reaching plains, so high above the giant columns beneath

her, the vast beamed roofs, the pointing obelisks. It made her

breath quicken and her pulses beat.


"Watch the moon," said Falconer in a low tone.


Blood-red it rose behind the dark pile, throwing into sinister

relief a gallows-like angle of stone beams, then higher and higher

it soared till its resplendent light poured unchecked into the wide

courts and broken temples, the unroofed altars and the empty

shrines.


"A dead world lighting a dead world," said Arlee under her breath.


"I could read by it," stated Miss Falconer impressively.


Lady Claire glanced up at Billy with a touch of mischief. "Would you

like to paint it?" she suggested.


"Heaven forbid!" said Billy soberly.


Falconer said nothing at all, except to Arlee. He was very shrewdly

drawing her to the other end of the pylon, seeing that the time of

descent was nearly upon them. And when the time arrived, and the

English ladies and their stoic escort started down the steep steps,

Falconer made no motion of following them. He stood still, his hands

in his pockets, and chuckled softly at the sound of his sister's

voice, floating lesseningly up to them.


"How Emma is dragoning that William Whatdycallit Hill," he said

appreciatively.


"Why do you call him that?" questioned Arlee.


"Oh, that chap is so deuced odd about that name of his. I asked him

what the B. stood for, and he looked me in the eye like a fighting

cock and said for his middle name.... Queer chap—" Suddenly

Falconer looked sidewise at Arlee and stopped.


"He is—unusual," she agreed, moving toward the steps.


The curious expression upon Falconer's face deepened. "Let 'em go

on," he said jerkily. "I don't want to leave this yet, do you?"


Arlee glanced about hesitantly, without answering, and slowly she

let fall the white froth of skirt she had been gathering for the

descent.


In silence she looked out over the temple. The moon had paled from

fire to molten silver now, and like scattered sparks of it burned

the thousand circling stars. She felt very strange and unreal—a

tiny figure topping this great gate in the face of the ancient

silence....


"We never have a chance for a word together," Falconer was mumbling,

with a nervous hand at his mustache.


Her thoughts came fleetly back from the ancient worlds.... Her own

was upon her. She turned and laughed at him. "We've talked for three

whole days!"


"Have we? But always in some group.... I understand that Hill told

you what a couple of donkeys we made of ourselves on your account?"

Anxiously he scanned her face, silver-clear in the moonlight, for

signs of ridicule.


But Arlee's smile was very sweet. It made the sandy-haired young

man's heart quicken mysteriously. "He told me," she said. "I think

it was fine of you."


"Fine? It was lunacy.... He'd got worked up over some horrible story

he'd heard," went on the young man in the mingling humor and

embarrassment, "and nothing for it but that you'd gone the same way.

And if you'll believe it, he had us prowling around that old palace

like a pair of jolly idiots primed to get their heads blown off—and

served us jolly well right! He was in luck to get off with nothing

but a scratch."


"A scratch—? You mean—you don't mean——?"


"He didn't tell you that?" Falconer was surprised; he had imagined

that Billy's narration had led romantically to Billy's wound. He

made the American a silent apology. "He was shot in the arm."


"Badly?"


"Of course not badly—he's all right now, isn't he? He said it was a

scratch."


Arlee was silent. He had been hurt all the time that he had been

riding with her over the desert ... he had been hurt all through

those horrible hot hours. And he had said nothing....


"When I think of what that chap got me in for—scaling a man's

walls, smashing in his locks, letting myself down the front of his

house like a monkey on a rope! I might have been a dashed school kid

again." Resentment and reluctant humor struggled in the young man's

speech. "Why, the fellow has the imagination of a detective ... and

of course he had some reason." Falconer's thoughts touched on the

fair-haired girl of Fritzi's report. "I'll admit he had me

worried—until I heard from the Evershams that you were all O.K. You

see what bally nonsense you put into young men's heads," he added

with a look of meaning.


"He's a very—chivalrous—young man," said Arlee.


"He's a very unbalanced young idiot," contradicted Falconer. "I

rather like the chap, himself, you know; he has nerve to spare—but

no ballast. He might have set all Cairo talking of you." His voice

hardened; "I told him that. I told him you wouldn't thank him for

it."


"I do thank him. I thank him with all my heart."


"Well, you've no reason to," Falconer returned in blunt belief.

"Linking your name with that Turk fellow; hinting you were in the

palace—he might have started a lot of rotten rumor!"


"What's—rumor?" said the girl in a breathless voice. "He was

thinking of—my safety!"


"Well, your safety didn't depend on him, did it?" Sharp jealousy of

her defense of the American intruder drove Falconer to unseemly

curtness. He gave a short laugh. "You and I," he said, "seem to be

always tilting over some chap or other."


A faint smile touched the girl's lips, a sorry little smile, edged

with rueful reminiscence ... and strange comparisons. In silence she

looked down into the shadowy temple courts where absurdly

small-looking people were strolling to and fro, while Falconer stood

looking down at her, with something akin to angry wonder in his

adoring eyes.


"Why didn't you write to a chap?" he abruptly demanded.


"Why should I?"


"Then you meant to let it go at that?" He drew a sharp breath. "Just

the way you flared off from that table—not a word more?"


"Why didn't you write?" the girl parried.


"I did," indignantly. "Twice—to Alexandria."


"Oh.... I didn't get them."


"I wrote, all right. I was so stirred up over that alarm of Hill's

that I urged you to answer me at once. And when you didn't, and when

I heard you had written the Evershams, well, I thought I knew what

I had to think.... When I met you here Friday I half expected you to

cut me, upon my word!"


"But I didn't!" She laughed softly. "I remembered you—perfectly."


"Oh, you did, did you?... You've acted as if that was about all you

did remember."


"I've been very, very nice to you!"


"But with a difference," he insisted resentfully. "Didn't you know I

must have written? You didn't think I wanted to let it stop there,

did you? You didn't think I meant that nonsense at tea——"


"Please don't go back to that," said the girl hurriedly. "We've been

good friends these three days without bringing it up—don't let us

do it now."


"Well, I don't enjoy thinking about it." His voice was sharp with

feeling. "You gave me the most miserable time of my life."


"I was very horrid."


"You told me you didn't give a piastre for what I thought!"


"I said I didn't give half a piastre!" murmured Arlee

irrepressibly, with a wicked dimple.


Reluctantly he grinned. "Well?" he put to her questioningly.


"Well?"


Their eyes met, sparkling, combative.


"You do, don't you?"


"What?"


"You do give a piastre for what I——"


"I'm afraid I do. I'm afraid I give a good many piastres for what

everyone thinks." The girl's smile had suddenly faded; her eyes

lowered and sought the far horizons.


In the silence he came a little closer to her. "Then Arlee—Arlee,

dear——"


She started, and turned hurriedly. "We must go down——"


"Why must we?"


"They'll be waiting."


"Let 'em. They'll be glad of the chance if they can get away from

Emma.... I want to talk to you."


"I think Mr. Hill is quite as nice as Lady Claire," flashed Arlee in

a childish voice.


"Claire seems to agree with you." Falconer spoke lightly, but

underneath sounded the note of the disgruntled male ... resentful of

the defection of even the girls he left behind him. He added, with

his fatal gift of truculent expression, "But that's perfectly

absurd."


"Why absurd?" Arlee's voice held careful calm. The flash in her eyes

was hidden.


Falconer made a gesture of extreme exasperation. To waste these

precious moonlight moments in trifling debate was the very height of

maddening futility.


"Oh, the chap's a feather-headed adventurer. What's the use of

talking about him?... But that's aside the mark. I want——"


"You mustn't call him an adventurer!" The flash was far from hidden

now. Her wide eyes blazed challenge at the disconcerted young man.

"It's not fair. It's not true."


"Oh, I don't mean it in any—any financial sense," the harassed

Falconer gave back. "But you can't expect me to take him seriously

after his exploits in Cairo? He's flighty. He goes off like a

rocket. He has illusions—but——"


"If you are going to slander him because of what he did for me—"

Arlee's voice was shaking.


"Oh, can't you see that's the key to his character!"


"Yes, I do see it." She sounded triumphant now. For a moment her

eves met his full of bright defiance; she hung fire, half scared,

then blazed into her revelation.


"For I was in that palace."


"What? What?" Falconer questioned in sheer vacancy of shock.


"I said—I was in that palace, Kerissen's palace."


"What!" came from him again, but now in twenty different

intonations, with absolute incredulity struggling for dominance.


Desperately she rushed on, her voice shaken but passionate.


"I tell you it is so. He got me there by a trick, a call upon his

sister. And he kept me by another trick, pretending a quarantine. I

was trapped there. The messages and all the Alexandria story were

Kerissen's frauds. He wanted to marry me. I'd have been there

to-night if it hadn't been for Billy Hill—that adventurer, as you

call him!"


It was impossible. It was unthinkable. Falconer stood staring down

at this girl whose white, upturned face, so amazingly ethereal and

childish, met his astounded gaze with unfaltering fixity, and from

his stiff lips dropped disjointed words and phrases, ejaculations of

denial, of disbelief.


She swept them utterly aside in her complete affirmation. "It's all

true—every bit."


"You—in that man's palace!" He was very pale, but into her white

face there surged a sudden flood of color, crimsoning it from brow

to throat.


"He didn't—hurt me," she stammered. "He was—quite mad—but he

didn't—hurt me."


She heard Falconer draw his breath with a queer, whistling sound. He

pushed back his hat and drew his hand over his forehead.


"It's—impossible," he persisted thickly, but there was bitter

relief in his voice. "The blackguard—the filthy blackguard!"


"Don't, don't, please don't! I can't bear to think of him. I've done

with even the thought of him.... He was trying to make me marry him.

I told you he was quite mad."


Sharply Falconer pulled himself together, in the tense effort to

meet this horrible astonishment like a man.


"And Hill got you out?"


"Yes.... He got me out."


"But the Evershams—they don't know——?"


"No, no, I've told no one. I'm not going to tell anyone. No one

knows of it but you and me—and Billy Hill."


"That's right." He drew another long breath, this time in sharp

relief. The color was coming back to his face, splotching it

unevenly. "You mustn't tell anyone. You don't know how a beastly

thing like that would spread. You mustn't let anyone have a hint.

Not even my sister."


Arlee's eyes were in shadow. Her voice came slowly. "They would

think so badly of me?"


"No—not of you—but it's the kind of thing, the impossible

things—A girl simply can't afford——"


"She can't afford to have even speculation against her," Arlee

finished quietly, but a little pulse in her throat was beating away

like mad. She knew he spoke the simple truth, but the taste of it

was bitter as gall to her mouth. However she had humbled herself in

secret self-communion, she had known no such shame as this.... She

felt cheapened ... tarnished....


"It's beastly—but she can't," he jerkily agreed, but with evident

relief at her sensible understanding. Perhaps he had remembered

Billy's fearful prophecy of the conversation with which the

adventure would supply her. "But of course nobody has a notion——"


"Not a notion. And I shan't give them any—not till I'm a

white-haired old lady in Mechlin caps, and then I shall make up

for lost time by boring all my world with the story of my romantic

youth and the wild deeds done for me!" She laughed airily, pride

high in her face, hiding her secret hurts.


"And Hill got you out," Falconer repeated, with a sudden twinge of

jealous envy in his young voice. "He—he's a lucky one."


"I'm the lucky one," Arlee flashed. "Think of the glorious luck

for me that sent him to paint there, outside the palace, where a

maid mistook him, and so gave a message. Why, it was a chance in a

million, in ten million—and it happened!"


"Happened?" Falconer looked at her a minute before continuing. Then

he asked quietly, "He told you that he just—happened—there?"


"Yes, he said by accident. He was painting——"


Now Falconer was an honest young man—and a gentleman. Deliberately

he brushed away his rival's generous subterfuge. "He doesn't paint,"

he told her. "He did that for an excuse—for a reason to stay

outside the palace. No chance directed it."


"Why, how—how did he know? Before——"


"He guessed. He was uneasy from the beginning—he made conjectures

and set himself to verify them."


After a moment, "I never knew—that!" said Arlee in slow wonder.


"Well, you know now," returned Falconer with a sense of grim justice

to the man he had belittled.


In the silence the girl moved toward the steps. He made a gesture to

stay her.


"You're not going—yet?"


"Yet?" she echoed, faintly mocking. "It's hours."


"But—but we can never see this again," he argued, weakly, parrying

with himself.


"We won't—forget it."


The words held a too-keen prophecy for him. He looked at her in

heart-beating uncertainty, and it seemed to him that all his future

was waiting on that moment. Should he speak? Should he utter that

which had been so near utterance when her astounding revelation had

stopped him?... After all, he knew nothing of her—but that she was

lovely and wilful and enchanting—with a capacity for risk—and a

dire disregard of consequences.... She was volatile, unstable,

bewildering—so he thought stiffeningly as he looked at her, but he

looked too long.


She was the very spirit of loveliness in the silver moon, her hair

a crown of light, her eyes deep with shadowy wistfulness, her lips

half sad, half tender.... He felt the blood burn hot in his face,

and took a quick step to bar the way.


"You must wait to hear what I was saying," he said, with a ring of

new command.


She gave him a sudden, startled look, and moved as if to pass him.


"You were saying—nothing," she answered proudly.


"I was saying—everything," he gave back incoherently. "Oh, Arlee,

do you think that story stops me! Don't you know—how much I want

you?" and with sudden vehemence he bent to clasp her in his arms.


    CHAPTER XXIII


    THE BETTER MAN


Down in the court of Rameses, Lady Claire and Hill were straying. A

most opportune old bachelor, passing with a party of acquaintances,

had diverted even Emma Falconer from her dragoning, and the young

English girl and her American escort were left for the time to their

own devices.


Not much was said. Claire, who had been fitfully gay all afternoon,

grew still as a church mouse now as they paced back and forth in the

shadows, stealing a slant glance from time to time at Billy's set

and silent face. She wondered a little at his absorption. But

chiefly she was thinking that she had never seen him look so

handsome ... with his brows knitted and his clear-cut lips pressed

sharply together ... but the boy of him somehow kept by that wilful

lock of black hair over his forehead.


To Billy it seemed that the bitterest drop of the cup was at his

lips. Those two—upon the pylon—were they never coming down? He was

waiting for them in every nerve, and yet he shrank from the look he

might read upon their faces. He thought, very grimly, that this

could mean but one thing, and that thing was the end forever and

ever, for him.... His heart was sick in him and he longed most

desperately to break away from these other women and the sham of

talk and dash off to dark solitude where the primitive man could

have his way, could tramp and fight and curse and sob and break his

heart in decent privacy. He faced with loathing the refinements of

torture which civilization imposes.


But the game had to be played. He was no quitter, he told himself

fiercely; he could stand up and take his punishment like a man. She

was not for him. He had loved her from the first, he had loved her

so that he had been clairvoyant to her peril, he had risked his neck

for her a dozen times and snatched her from a life that was a

death-in-life—and yet she was not for him. She was for a man who

had not believed in her danger, had not bestirred himself.... Black,

seething bitterness was boiling in Billy B. Hill. Darkly, through a

fog, he heard the outer man replying to some speech from the girl

beside him.


He understood, he told himself in a burst of despairing anguish, how

Kerissen could have plotted for her. Almost he longed to be a

scrupleless Oriental and carry her off across his saddle bow.... And

then he brought himself up short.


Was that all she meant to him, he asked himself with the sweat of

pain on his forehead beneath that black lock which was finding such

favor in Lady Claire's eyes—was that all she meant to him?—a prize

to be won? One man had tried to steal her; he had wished to earn

her—but she was a gift beyond all price and the giving lay in her

own heart alone.... And if Falconer was the man for her, then at

least he, Billy B. Hill, was man enough to stand up and be glad for

her and be humbly grateful to the end of his days that he had been

able to save her ... and give her her happiness. For it was really

he who had given it to her. And in that thought Billy Hill's young

heart expanded, and his soul stretched itself to such unwonted

heights that it seemed to push among the stars.


"It is an unforgettable night," said the girl in the rose cloak.


He thought that was just the word for it, and a wryly humorous glint

was in the look he gave her. And he thought that she, too, was

playing the game mighty stanchly, and had been playing it bravely

these three days, since her conquering little rival had made her

reappearance. His heart warmed toward her in understanding and

compassion. They were comrades in affliction. He was not the only

one in the world who was not getting the heart's desire.


Aloud he answered, "And the last night for me."


Lady Claire looked up quickly. Her voice showed her struck with

sudden surprise. "You are going—so soon?"


"To-morrow."


"To Assouan?" Odd sharpness edged the question.


He waited a perceptible moment, though his resolution had been

taken. "Back to Cairo."


"Oh ... How long shall you be there?"


"Just till I get sailings. It's time for me to be off. I'm really a

working person, you know, not a playing one."


"You make bridges—and dams—and things, don't you?" she questioned

vaguely.


"Bridges—and dams—and things."


"Why don't you wait here for your sailings?" she asked impersonally

after another pause. "It's so much more attractive here than

Cairo."


"I'd like to." He thought of next Friday—and Arlee's return—and

the masked ball. For a moment temptation urged. Then he threw back

his head with a gesture of decision. "But I can't. It's impossible."


Now Lady Claire did not know that he was thinking of next

Friday—and Arlee's return—and the masked ball. She only knew that

he spoke with a curious fierceness, and that his eyes were very

bright. And something in the girl, something strange and

acknowledged that had been so fitfully gay and light these three

days, quickened in mysterious excitement.


"Nothing is impossible," she gave back, "to a man!"


Billy thought she was resenting the conventions of the restricted

sex. She could not make any open advance toward Falconer while he,

as man, could make all the open advances to Arlee he was willing

to—but in this case his hands were tied. A man cannot inflict

himself upon a girl who may not feel herself free to reject him. He

laughed, with sorry ruefulness.


"There's a whole lot," he observed, "that is impossible to a man who

tries to be one," and then, oblivious of any construction she might

choose to put upon this cryptic utterance, he strolled moodily on,

in brooding silence.


After a pause, "Of course," said Lady Claire in so gentle a little

voice that it seemed to glide undisturbingly among his silent

meditations, "of course, a man has his—pride."


"I hope so," said the young man briefly. He understood her to be

probing for his reason for abandoning the chase; he understood that

for her own sake she would like to see him successful with Arlee,

and he was queerly sorry to be failing to help her there. But he had

done all that he could....


The girl spoke again, her face straight ahead, her shadowy eyes

staring out into the moonlight. "Is it—money?" she said in the same

little breath of a voice.


"Money!" Billy threw back the words in surprise, half contemptuous,

"Oh, Lord, no, it's not money! I haven't much of it now, but I'm

going to make a bunch of the stuff—if I want to." He spoke with

naïve and amazing confidence which somehow struck astounded belief

into the listener. "There's enough of it there, waiting to be

made—no, it's not money—though perhaps one might well think it

ought to be. I suppose my work might strike a girl as hard for her,"

he went on, considering aloud these problems of existence, "for it's

here to-day and there to-morrow—now doing a building in a roaring

city and now damming up some reservoir deep in the mountains—but it

always seemed to me that the girl who would like me would like that,

too. It's seeing so much of life—and such real life! Oh, no," he

said, and though a trace of doubt had struck into his voice, "that

in itself wouldn't be what I'd call impossible—not for the right

girl."


"But your work—would it always be in America?" said Lady Claire.


"Oh, always. It has to be, of course."


"Oh.... And—and—you—have to have—that work?"


"Why, of course, I have to have it!" Billy was bewildered, but

entirely positive. "That's my work—the thing I'm made to do. I

couldn't earn my salt selling apartment houses."


"Oh, no, no," the girl hurriedly agreed.


A long, long silence followed, a silence in which he was entirely

oblivious to her imaginings. The moonlight lay heavy as dreams about

them; her thoughts went darting to and fro like fluttering

swallows.... She felt herself a stranger to herself.... She looked

up at him with a sudden deer-like lift of her head, and then looked

swiftly away.


"Don't go," she said in a quick, low voice. "Don't go—yet. Even

things that look impossible—can be made to come right."


He understood that she was pleading with him, partly for the sake of

her own chance with Falconer, but the sympathy flicked him on the

raw. He was sorry for her, sorry for the queer, strained look in her

face, sorry for the voice so full of feeling, but he couldn't do

anything to help her.


In silence he shook his head and was astounded at the look of sudden

proud anger she darted at him.


"You're a mighty real friend to take such an interest in my luck,"

he said quickly, with warm liking in his voice, "and I only wish you

could play fairy godmother and give me my wish—but you can't, Lady

Claire, and apparently she won't, and that is the end of the

matter. I have to take off my hat to the Better Man."


Lady Claire did not gasp or stammer or question. She did none of the

dismayedly enlightening things into which a lesser poise might have

tottered. After an inconsiderable moment of silence she merely

uttered her familiar, "Oh!" and uttered it in a voice in which so

many things were blended that their elements could hardly be

perceived.


She added hurriedly, "I'm sorry if I've seemed to—to intrude into

your affairs."


"My affairs are on my sleeve," answered Billy and wondered at the

quick look she gave him.


"Oh, no—not at all," she answered a little breathlessly. "I'm sure

they haven't seemed so to me—but then I'm stupid." She stopped for

a moment of hot wonder at that stupidity. She had not believed Miss

Falconer—had thought her prejudiced ... maneuvering.... Like

lightning she reviewed the baffling interchange of sentences, then

glanced up at Billy's silent absorption. She felt queerly grateful

for his innocent density. "And perhaps she's stupid, too," she

told him. "You'd better make sure. You'd better make absolutely

sure."


He looked down on her with sorry humor in his face. "Do I need to

make surer?" He nodded in the direction of the giant gateway.

"They've had time to settle the divisions of the Balkans up there."


"Oh, yes, they've had time!" She seemed speaking at sudden laughing

random. "But we've had the same time and you see we haven't

settled anything with it—not even that you're to stay. Yes, you'd

better make sure, Mr. Hill."


Billy was hardly heeding. A laugh had caught his ears, a light high

laugh like the tinkle of a little silver bell through the darkness.

In the shadows behind them he made out a man and a woman arm in arm.


"Just a moment," he begged of Lady Claire. "May I leave you here a

moment? I must see those—I think I know——" Without listening to

her automatic permission he was gone.


The next moment he had laid his hand on the arm of the man with the

woman. Both spun quickly about. A babble of explanation broke out.


"Ach, mein freund, mein freund——"


"Oh, it is Billy——"


"How gut to find you here——"


"Our American Billy."


The last voice, piquantly foreign, was the voice of Fritzi Baroff.

And the first voice gutterally foreign was the voice of Frederick

von Deigen. Arm in arm, flushed, happy, sentimental, the two began

talking in a breath, thanking Billy for the letter he had sent von

Deigen which had brought them together, and apologizing for their

hasty flight—"a honeymoon upon the Nile," the German joyfully

explained.


Discreetly Billy forbore to make any discoveries as to the exact

status of their "honeymoon." The German's face was very honestly

happy, and the little dancer was brimming with restless life and

vivacity.


"It was the picture in my watch—hein? The picture I carry night

and day," Frederick repeated in needless explanation, and was about

to draw out the picture when Billy restrained him.


He had a favor to ask. The American girl of Kerissen's palace had

escaped unharmed and returned to her friends who were ignorant of

all. She was this moment in the ruins. It would be a great shock to

her to meet Fritzi, to have Fritzi recognize her. On the morning she

would be gone. Would Fritzi——"


"Fritzi must disappear—for the night?" said the little Viennese

smiling wisely, but with a trace of cynicism. "The little American

must not be reminded—h'm? We will go.... For you have done so much

for me, you big, strange, platonic Mr. Billy!" Dazzlingly she smiled

on him, her dark eyes quizzically provocative.


"You're not at the Grand?"


"No, not that." She named another. "You come see me, when that girl

goes—h'm?"


Billy caught the German's eyes upon him, in their depths a faint

trouble, a vague appeal. He comprehended that the infatuated young

man had engaged in the tortuous business of keeping sparks from

tinder.


"I'm gone to-morrow," he replied.


"Maybe in Vienna?" went on the dancer. "We go soon—another day or

so maybe—and then back over the water to that life I left! Oh, my

God, how happy I am to go back to it all—to dance, to sing—Oh, I

could kiss you, Mr. Billy, if it would not make you so shock!" she

added with a malicious little laugh. "You know the news—about

him—h'm?"


"Him?"


"Kerissen—that devil fellow. He is in Cairo with a fever—in the

hospital there. A man who come from that hospital just tells

us—just by accident he tell us. A bad fever, too!" She laughed in

satisfaction. "I hope he burn good and hard up," she added, with

energetic spite, "and teach him not to act like a wild man. That man

say he got a bad hand," she added, with a shrewd glance at Billy.


The young man merely grunted. "I hope he has," he replied. "It

matches the rest of him. Good night."


"Good night—for the now—h'm, Mr. Billy?" and with a quick little

clasp of his big hand and a gay little backward look the girl was

gone into the shadows upon the arm of her jealous cavalier.


Three people were waiting at the statue foot where he had left the

English girl.


"They've come at last, Mr. Hill," Lady Claire's voice struck very

gaily upon him, "and Miss Falconer has just come to tell us we must

see the colored lights in the great court—and then go home. So

hurry!"


She turned as she spoke and put her arm suddenly through Falconer's

who was standing next her. "Come on," she lightly commanded, and

promptly led the way.


That was something like a fairy godmother! Into Billy's eyes flashed

a warm light of gladness. Some moments out of that wretched evening

should yet be his own, bitter-sweet as they were in their sharp

finality.


He turned to the blue-cloaked figure at his side. "Do you like

colored fire?" he demanded. "Won't you come and see something

else—something I've wanted to see and to have you see with me? It's

near the way out. We can meet them at the pylon."


Of course she acquiesced. That was part of the cursed restraint

between them, he was reminded, to have her accept so obediently any

point-blank request of his. But for the nonce he was glad. He wanted

those few minutes desperately.


"What is it?" she murmured.


"I'll show you," and then, as he turned from the way they had come

and followed a winding path that dipped lower and lower between the

dune-like piles of sand, "It's the Sacred Lake," he explained.

"Perhaps you've seen it in the daytime—but I've been wanting to see

it at night."


"I think I just caught the glint of it from the pylon," she

observed.


"You had time to," said Billy, trying to twinkle down at her in

friendly fashion.


She did not twinkle back. She looked as suddenly guilty as a kitten

in the cream, and Billy's heart smote him heavily. He did not speak

again till they had rounded a corner and their path had brought them

out upon the shore of the Sacred Lake.


Like a little horseshoe it circled about three sides of the ruined

temple of the goddess Mut, inky-black and motionless with the stars

looking up uncannily like drowned lights from its still waters, and

inky-black and motionless, like guardian spirits about it, sat a

hundred cat-headed women of grim granite. It was a spot of stark

loneliness and utter silence, of ancient terror and desolate

abandonment; the solitude and the blackness and the aching age smote

upon the imagination like a heavy hand upon harp strings.


"Who are—they?" Arlee spoke in a hushed voice, as if the cat-headed

women were straining their ears.


"They're mysteries," said Billy, speaking in the same low tone.

"Generally they're said to be statues of the Goddess Pasht or

Sehket—but it's a riddle why the Amen-hotep person who built this

temple to the goddess Mut should have put Sehket here. Sehket is in

the trinity of Memphis—and Mut in that of Thebes. And so some

people say that this is not Pasht at all, but Mut herself, who was

sometimes represented as lion-headed. Between a giant cat and a

lion, you know, there's not much of difference."


"I like Pasht better than Mut," said Arlee decidedly.


"There you agree with Baedecker."


"What did Pasht do?"


"She was goddess of girls," said Billy, "and young wives. She got

the girls husbands and the wives—er—their requests. Girls used to

come down here at night and make a prayer to her and cast an

offering into the waters."


"And then they had their prayer?"


"Infallibly."


"I'd like a guardian like that," said Arlee, with a sudden

mischievous wistfulness that played the dickens with Billy's forces

of reserve. "Do you think she'd grant my prayer?"


"Have you one to make?" said Billy, staring very hard for safety at

the monstrous images.


"They look as if they were coming alive," he added.


The moon had come up over an obstructing roof and now flashed down

upon them; a ripple of light began to swim across the star-eyes in

the inky waters; a finger of quicksilver seemed to be playing over

the scarred faces of the granite goddesses.


"They never died," said Arlee positively. "They're just waiting

their time. Can't you see they know all about us?... They

particularly know that you are the most deceiving young man they

ever saw! Why didn't you tell me you were shot in the arm?" she

finished rapidly.


"What?... Where did you hear that?"


"Mr. Falconer enlightened me."


"I wish Falconer would keep his stories to himself," said Billy

ungratefully. "It's just a——"


"Scratch," said Arlee promptly. "That's always a hero's word for

it."


Billy turned scarlet. He felt hot back to his ears.


"And why did you tell me that you happened to be painting outside

the palace?" went on the unsparing voice. "You let me think it was

all accident—and it was all you, just you!"


"Good Lord," groaned Billy, effecting merriment over his

discomfiture, "Is there anything else he told you?... Look here, you

shouldn't have been talking about it," he said with sudden anxiety.


Arlee smiled. "It's all over," she said. "I told him everything."


Billy's heart missed a beat, and then hurried painfully to make up

for it. He felt a curious constriction in his throat. He tried to

think of something congratulatory to say and was lamentably silent.


"Why did you deceive me so?" she continued mercilessly. "Because my

gratitude was so obnoxious to you? Were you so afraid I would

insist upon flinging more upon you?"


"That's a horrid word, obnoxious," said Billy painfully.


"I thought so," thrust in a pointed voice.


"I only meant," he slowly made out, "that a sense of—of obligation

is a stupid burden—and I didn't want you to feel you had to be any

more friendly to me than your heart dictated. That is all. It was

enough for me to remember that I had once been privileged to help

you."


"You—funny—Billy B. Hill person," said the voice in a very serious

tone. Billy continued staring at the unwinking old goddess ahead of

him. "You take it all so for granted," laughed Arlee softly, "As if

it were part of any day's work! I go about like a girl in a

dream—or a girl with a dream ... a dream of fear, of old palaces

and painted women and darkened windows. It comes over me at night

sometimes. And then I wake and could go down on my knees to you....

I suppose there isn't any more danger from him?" she broke off to

half-whisper quickly.


"He's sick in the Cairo hospital," Billy made haste to inform her.

"I found out by accident. I understand he has a bad fever. So I

think he'll be up to no more tricks—and I'm out the satisfaction

of a little heart-to-heart talk."


"Oh, I told you you couldn't," she cried quickly. "You would make

him too angry. He isn't just—sane."


"Then all I have to do in Egypt is to hunt up my little Imp," said

Billy. "I must see the little chap again—before I go."


He waited—uselessly as he had foretold. She said nothing, and if

the glance he felt upon him was of inquiry he did not look about to

meet it. He was still staring a saturnine Pasht out of countenance.

There was a pause.


Then, "However were you able to think of it all?" said Arlee in slow

wonder. "However were you able to think such an impossible thought

as my imprisonment?"


"Because I was thinking about you," said Billy. Suddenly his tongue

ran away with him. "Incessantly," he added.


She looked up at him. Unguardedly he looked down at her. No one but

a blind girl or a goose could have mistaken that look upon Billy B.

Hill's young face, the frustrate longing of it, the deep desire. The

heart beneath the sky-blue cloak cast off a most monstrous

accumulation of doubts and fears and began suddenly to beat like

mad.


Totally unexpectedly, startlingly amazing, she flung out at him,

"Then what made you stop?"


"Stop?" he echoed. "Stop? I've never stopped! There hasn't been a

moment——"


"There have been three days. Three—horrible—days!"


"Arlee!"


"Do you think I like being snubbed and ignored

and—and—obliterated?" she brought indignantly out. "Do you think I

call that—being friends?"


"I—I wanted to leave you free—not to force your friendship——" he

stammered wildly.


"You couldn't force mine," said Arlee Beecher.


"But—but there was Falconer," he protested. "You had to be free

to—to have a choice——"


"A choice? Do you call that a choice?"


"I thought you were making it. That first night——"


"I stayed up to dance with you," she cried hotly. "You never came

back!"


"But the next day——"


"I wanted to go. But I couldn't keep up any more. I had to

rest.... And you went with Lady Claire!"


"Why, I had to! We'd planned. But when we came back, he was on deck

with you——"


"Yes, and I was waiting up—to see you. And you only took two

dances that night——"


"You didn't seem to want me to——"


"I never guessed you wanted them! I had my pride, too. I wasn't

going to be in the way—because you'd rescued me. I thought you

didn't want me in the way!"


"Arlee—my girl—my precious girl——"


"No, I'm not. I'm not."


"Yes, you are," he said fiercely. "I don't care if you are engaged

to Falconer or not, I'm going to tell you so."


"I'm not engaged to Falconer," she protested.


He blurted in bewilderment. "Then what in the world were you doing

up there on that pylon?"


Her elfish laughter disconcerted him. "Do you think one has to get

engaged if she stays on a pylon?... We were getting not engaged."


"I thought—I thought you liked him," he said bewilderedly.


"I did. I do, I mean—but not that way. He—he—Oh, I really like

him," she cried tremulously, "but not—we've had it all out and

everything's all over. I'm sorry—sorry—but he'll be really glad

bye and bye. For my story shocked him terribly.... And then there's

Lady Claire. He didn't like to have her down with you even when he

was up with me." She laughed softly. "Oh, I shouldn't have let him

be so friendly here but I did like him and you—you were so—so

hateful."


The moon and stars whirled giddily around him as he put his arms

about her. Like a man in a dream he drew her to him.


"I love you—love you," he said huskily over the bright maze of

hair.


"You don't!" came with muffled intensity from the hidden lips. "You

said to that man—when I was in that cave—'Nothing doing!'"


"It wasn't his affair—I hadn't a hope.... Oh, my dear, my dear,

I've been breaking my heart——"


"And I've had such a perfectly h-hateful three days," sobbed the

voice.


His arms closed tighter about her, incredible of their happiness.


"Oh, Arlee, I can't tell you—I haven't words——"


"I've had deeds!" she whispered.


Through his rocking mind darted a memory of her earlier speech to

him. "You said you didn't want words. Arlee—will you?"


She flung back her head and looked up at him, her face a flower, her

eyes like stars tangled in the bright mist of her hair.


"Billy, what's your middle name?"


"Bunker.... I can't help it, dear. They wished it on me and asked me

not to let it go. But Bunker Hill——!"


"It's a wonderful name, Billy! A perfectly irresistible name!" Her

eyes laughed up at him through a dazzle of tears, and prankishly

over her curving lips hovered a mischievous dimple. "It's a

name—that—I—simply—can't—do—without—Billy Bunker Hill!"


The dimple deepened then fled before its just deserts. For if ever a

dimple deserved to be caught and kissed that was the one.
