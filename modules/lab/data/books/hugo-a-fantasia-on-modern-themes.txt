CHAPTER I
THE DOME
He wakened from a charming dream, in which

the hat had played a conspicuous part.
'I shouldn't mind having that hat,' he

murmured.
A darkness which no eye could penetrate

surrounded him as he lay in bed. Absolute

obscurity was essential to the repose of that

singular brain, and he had perfected arrangements

for supplying the deficiencies of

Nature's night.
He touched a switch, and in front of him at

a distance of thirty feet the ivory dial of a

clock became momentarily visible under the

soft yellow of a shaded electric globe. It was

fifteen minutes past six. At the same

moment a bell sounded the quarter in delicate

tones, which fell on the ear as lightly as dew.

In the upper gloom could be discerned the

contours of a vast dome, decorated in turquoise-blue

and gold.
He pressed a button near the switch. A

portière rustled, and a young man approached

his bed—a short, thin, pale, fair young man,

active and deferential.
'My tea, Shawn. Draw the curtains and

open the windows.'
'Yes, sir,' said Simon Shawn.
In an instant the room was brilliantly

revealed as a great circular apartment,

magnificently furnished, with twelve windows

running round the circumference beneath the

dome. The virginal zephyrs of a July

morning wandered in. The sun, although

fierce, slanted his rays through the six eastern

windows, printing a new pattern on the

Tripoli carpets. Between the windows were

bookcases, full of precious and extraordinary

volumes, and over the bookcases hung pictures

of the Barbizon school. These books and

these pictures were the elegant monument of

hobbies which their owner had outlived.

His present hobby happened to be music. A

Steinway grand-piano was prominent in the

chamber, and before the ebony instrument

stood a mechanical pianoforte-player.
'I must have that hat.'
He paused reflectively, leaning on one

elbow, as he made the tea which Simon

Shawn had brought and left on the night-table.

And again, at the third cup, he

repeated to himself that he must possess the

hat.
He had a passion for tea. His servants had

received the strictest orders to supply him at

early morn with materials sufficient only for

two cups. Nevertheless, they were always a

little generous, and, by cheating himself

slightly in the first and the second cup, the

votary could often, to his intense joy, conjure

a third out of the pot.
After glancing through the newspaper

which accompanied the tea, he jumped vivaciously

out of bed, veiled the splendour of his

pyjamas beneath a quilted toga, and disappeared

into a dressing-room, whistling.
'Shawn!' he cried out from his bath, when

he heard the rattle of the tea-tray.
'Yes, sir?'
'Play me the Chopin Fantasie, will you. I

feel like it.'
'Certainly, sir,' said Simon, and paused.

'Which particular one do you desire me to

render, sir?'
'There is only one, Shawn, for piano solo.'
'I beg pardon, sir.'
The gentle plashing of water mingled with

the strains of one of the greatest of all musical

compositions, as interpreted by Simon Shawn

with the aid of an ingenious contrivance the

patentees of which had spent twenty thousand

pounds in advertising it.
'Very good, Shawn,' said Shawn's master,

coming forward in his shirt-sleeves as the last

echoes of a mighty chord expired under the

dome. He meditatively stroked his graying

beard while the pianist returned to the tea-tray.
'And, Shawn—'
'Yes, sir?'
'I want a hat.'
'A hat, sir?'
'A lady's hat.'
'Yes, sir.'
'Run down into Department 42, there's

a good fellow, and see if you can find me a

lady's hat of dark-blue straw, wide brim,

trimmed chiefly with a garland of pinkish

rosebuds.'
'A lady's hat of dark-blue straw, wide

brim, trimmed chiefly with pinkish rosebuds,

sir?'
'Precisely. Here, you're forgetting the

token.'
He detached a gold medallion from his

watch-chain, and handed it to Shawn, who

departed with it and with the tea-tray.
Two minutes later, having climbed the

staircase between the inner and outer domes,

he stood, fully clad in a light-gray suit, on

the highest platform of the immense building,

whose occidental façade is the glory of Sloane

Street and one of the marvels of the metropolis.

Far above him a gigantic flag spread

its dazzling folds to the sun and the breeze.

On the white ground of the flag, in purple

letters seven feet high, was traced the single

word, 'HUGO.'
From his eyrie he could see half the West

End of London. Sloane Street stretched

north and south like a ruled line, and along

that line two hurrying processions of black

dots approached each other, and met and

vanished below him; they constituted the

first division of his army of three thousand

five hundred employés.
He leaned over the balustrade, and sniffed

the pure air with exultant, eager nostrils.

He was forty-six. He did not feel forty-six,

however. In common with every man of

forty-six, and especially every bachelor of

forty-six, he regarded forty-six as a mere

meaningless number, as a futile and even misleading

symbol of chronology. He felt that

Time had made a mistake—that he was not

really in the fifth decade, and that his true,

practical working age was about thirty.
Moreover, he was in love, for the first time

in his life. Like all men and all women, he

had throughout the whole of his adult existence

been ever secretly preoccupied with

thoughts, hopes, aspirations, desires, concerning

the other sex, but the fundamental

inexperience of his heart was such that he

imagined he was going to be happy because

he had fallen in love.
'I'm glad I sent for that hat,' he said,

smiling absently at the Great Wheel over a

mile and a half of roofs.
The key to his character and his career lay

in the fact that he invariably found sufficient

courage to respond to his instincts, and that

his instincts were romantic. They had led

him in various ways, sometimes to grandiose

and legitimate triumphs, sometimes to hidden

shames which it is merciful to ignore. In the

main, they had served him well. It was in

obedience to an instinct that he had capped

the nine stories of the Hugo building with a

dome and had made his bed under the dome.

It was in obedience to another instinct that

he had sent for the hat.
'Very pretty, isn't it?' he observed to

Shawn, when Simon handed him the insubstantial

and gay object and restored the gold

token. They were at a window in the circular

room; the couch had magically melted

away.
'I admire it, sir,' said Shawn, and withdrew.
'Dolt!' he cried out upon Shawn in his

heart. 'You didn't see her at work on it.

As if you could appreciate her exquisite taste

and the amazing skill of her blanched fingers!

I alone can appreciate these things!'
He hung the hat on a Louis Quatorze

screen, and blissfully gazed at it, her creation.
'But I must be careful,' he muttered—'I

must be careful.'
A clerk entered with his personal letters.

It was scarcely seven o'clock, but these

fifteen or twenty envelopes had already been

sorted from the three thousand missives that

constituted his first post; he had his own

arrangement with the Post-Office.
'So it's coming at last,' he said to himself,

as he opened an envelope marked 'Private

and Confidential' in red ink. The autograph

note within was from Senior Polycarp, principal

partner in Polycarps, the famous firm

of company-promoting solicitors, and it

heralded a personal visit from the august

lawyer at 11.30 that day.
In the midst of dictating instructions to the

clerk, Mr. Hugo stopped and rang for Shawn.
'Take that back,' he commanded, indicating

the hat. 'I've done with it.'
'Yes, sir.'
The hat went.
'I may just as well be discreet,' his thought

ran.
But her image, the image of the artist in

hats, illumined more brightly than ever his

soul.

CHAPTER II
THE ESTABLISHMENT
Seven years before, when, having unostentatiously

acquired the necessary land, and

an acre or two over, Hugo determined to

rebuild his premises and to burst into full

blossom, he visited America and Paris, and

amongst other establishments inspected

Wanamaker's, the Bon Marché, and the

Magasins du Louvre. The result disappointed

him. He had expected to pick up ideas, but

he picked up nothing save the Bon Marché

system of vouchers, by which a customer

buying in several departments is spared the

trouble of paying separately in each department.

He came to the conclusion that the art

of flinging money away in order that it may

return tenfold was yet quite in its infancy.

He said to himself, 'I will build a shop.'
Travelling home by an indirect route, he

stopped at a busy English seaport, and saw a

great town-hall majestically rising in the

midst of a park. The beautiful building did

not appeal to him in vain. At the gates of

the park he encountered a youth, who was

staring at the town-hall with a fixed and

fascinated stare.
'A fine structure,' Hugo commented to the

youth.
'I think so,' was the reply.
'Can you tell me who is the architect?'

asked Hugo.
'I am,' said the youth. 'And let me beg

of you not to make any remark on my juvenile

appearance. I am sick of that.'
They lunched together, and Hugo learnt

that the genius, after several years spent in

designing the varnished interiors of public-houses,

had suddenly come out first in an open

competition for the town-hall; thenceforward

he had thought in town-halls.
'I want a shop putting up,' said Hugo.
The youth showed no interest.
'And when I say a shop,' Hugo pursued,

'I mean a shop.'
'Oh, a shop you mean!' ejaculated the

youth, faintly stirred. They both spoke in

italics.
'A real shop. Sloane Street. A hundred

and eighty thousand superficial feet. Cost a

quarter of a million. The finest shop in the

world!'
The youth started to his feet.
'I've never had any luck,' said he, gazing

at Hugo. 'But I believe you really do understand

what a shop ought to be.'
'I believe I do,' Hugo concurred. 'And I

want one.'
'You shall have it!' said the youth.
And Hugo had it, though not for anything

like the sum he had named.
The four frontages of his land exceeded in

all a quarter of a mile. The frontage to Sloane

Street alone was five hundred feet. It was

this glorious stretch of expensive earth which

inflamed the architect's imagination.
'But we must set back the façade twenty

feet at least,' he said; and added, 'That will

give you a good pavement.'
'Young man,' cried Hugo, 'do you know

how much this land has stood me in a

foot?'
'I neither know nor care,' answered the

youth. 'All I say is, what's the use of putting

up a decent building unless people can see it?'
Hugo yielded. He felt as though, having

given the genius something to play with, he

must not spoil the game. The game included

twelve thousand pounds paid to budding

sculptors for monumental groups of a symbolic

tendency; it included forests of onyx pillars

and pillars of Carrara marble; it included

ceilings painted by artists who ought to have

been R.A.'s, but were not; and it included a

central court of vast dimensions and many

fountains, whose sole purpose was to charm

the eye and lure the feet of customers who

wanted a rest from spending money. Whenever

Hugo found the game over-exciting, he

soothed himself by dwelling upon the wonderful

plan which the artist had produced, of his

extraordinary grasp of practical needs, and

his masterly solution of the various complicated

problems which continually presented

themselves.
After the last bit of scaffolding was removed

and the machine in full working order, Hugo

beheld it, and said emphatically, 'This will do.'
All London stood amazed, but not at the

austere beauty of the whole, for only a few

connoisseurs could appreciate that. What

amazed London was the fabulous richness, the

absurd spaciousness, the extravagant perfection

of every part of the immense organism.
You could stroll across twenty feet of

private tessellated pavement, enter jewelled

portals with the assistance of jewelled commissionaires,

traverse furlong after furlong of

vistas where nought but man was vile,

sojourn by the way in the concert-hall, the

reading-room, or the picture-gallery, smoke

a cigarette in the court of fountains, write a

letter in the lounge, and finally ask to be

directed to the stationery department, where

seated on a specially designed chair and surrounded

by the most precious manifestations

of applied art, you could select a threepenny

box of J pens, and have it sent home in a pair-horse

van.
The unobservant visitor wondered how

Hugo made it pay. The observant visitor

did not fail to note that there were more than

a hundred cash-desks in the place, and that

all the cashiers had the air of being overworked.

Once the entire army of cashiers,

driven to defensive action, had combined in

order to demand from Hugo, not only higher

pay, but an increase in their numbers. Hugo

had immediately consented, expressing regret

that their desperate plight had escaped his

attention.
The registered telegraphic address of the

establishment was 'Complete, London.'
This address indicated the ideal which Hugo

had turned into a reality. His imperial

palace was far more than a universal bazaar.

He boasted that you could do everything

there, except get into debt. (His dictionary

was an expurgated edition, and did not

contain the word 'credit.') Throughout life's

fitful fever Hugo undertook to meet all your

demands. Your mother could buy your

layette from him, and your cradle, soothing-syrup,

perambulator, and toys; she could

hire your nurse at Hugo's. Your school-master

could purchase canes there. Hugo

sold the material for every known game; also

sweets, cigarettes, penknives, walking-sticks,

moustache-forcers, neckties, and trouser-stretchers.

He shaved you, and kept the

latest in scents and kit-bags. He was unsurpassed

for fishing-rods, motor-cars, Swinburne's

poems, button-holes, elaborate bouquets,

fans, and photographs. His restaurant

was full of discreet corners with tables for two

under rose-shaded lights. He booked seats

for theatres, trains, steamers, grand-stands,

and the Empire. He dealt in all stocks and

shares. He was a banker. He acted as

agent for all insurance companies. He would

insert advertisements in the agony column, or

any other column, of any newspaper. If you

wanted a flat, a house, a shooting-box, a

castle, a yacht, or a salmon river, Hugo could

sell, or Hugo could let, the very thing. He

provided strong-rooms for your savings, and

summer quarters for your wife's furs; conjurers

to amuse your guests after dinner, and

all the requisites for your daughter's wedding,

from the cake and the silk petticoats to the

Viennese band. His wine-cellars and his

specific for the gout were alike famous; so

also was his hair-dye.... And, lastly,

when the riddle of existence had become too

much for your curiosity, Hugo would sell you

a pistol by means of which you could solve it.

And he would bury you in a manner first-class,

second-class, or third-class, according

to your deserts.
And all these feats Hugo managed to

organize within the compass of four floors, a

basement, and a sub-basement. Above, were

five floors of furnished and unfurnished flats.

'Will people of wealth consent to live over a

shop?' he had asked himself in considering

the possibilities of his palace, and he had

replied, 'Yes, if the shop is large enough and

the rents are high enough.' He was right.

His flats were the most sumptuous and the

most preposterously expensive in London;

and they were never tenantless. One man

paid two thousand a year for a furnished

suite. But what a furnished suite! The

flats had a separate and spectacular entrance

on the eastern façade of the building, with a

foyer that was always brilliantly lighted, and

elevators that rose and sank without intermission

day or night. And on the ninth floor

was a special restaurant, with prices to match

the rents, and a roof garden, where one of

Hugo's orchestras played every fine summer

evening, except Sundays. (The County

Council, mistrusting this aerial combination

of music and moonbeams, had granted its

license only on the condition that customers

should have one night in which to recover

from the doubtful influences of the other six.)

The restaurant and the roof-garden were a

resort excessively fashionable during the

season. The garden gave an excellent view

of the dome, where Hugo lived. But few

persons knew that he lived there; in some

matters he was very secretive.
That very sultry morning Hugo brooded

over the face of his establishment like a spirit

doomed to perpetual motion. For more than

two hours he threaded ceaselessly the long

galleries where the usual daily crowds of

customers, sales-people, shopwalkers, inspectors,

sub-managers, managers, and private

detectives of both sexes, moved with a strange

and unaccustomed languor in a drowsy atmosphere

which no system of ventilation could

keep below 75° Fahrenheit. None but the

chiefs of departments had the right to address

him as he passed; such was the rule. He

deviated into the counting-house, where two

hundred typewriters made their music, and

into the annexe containing the stables and

coach-houses, where scores of vans and automobiles,

and those elegant coupés gratuitously

provided by Hugo for the use of important

clients, were continually arriving and leaving.

Then he returned to the purchasing multitudes,

and plunged therein as into a sea. At

intervals a customer, recognising him, would

nudge a friend, and point eagerly.
'That's Hugo. See him, in the gray suit?'
'What? That chap?'
And they would both probably remark at

lunch: 'I saw Hugo himself to-day at Hugo's.'
He took an oath in his secret heart that he

would not go near Department 42, the only

department which had the slightest interest

for him. He knew that he could not be too

discreet. And yet eventually, without knowing

how or why, he perceived of a sudden that

his legs carried him thither. He stopped, at

a loss what to do, and then, by the direct

interposition of kindly Fate, a manager spoke

to him.... He gazed out of the corner of

his eye. Yes, she was there. He could see

her through a half-drawn portière in one of

the trying-on rooms. She was sitting limp

on a chair, overcome by the tropic warmth of

Sloane Street, with her noble head thrown

back, her fine eyes half shut, and her

beautiful hands lying slackly on her black

apron.
What an impeachment of civilization that

a creature so fair and so divine should be

forced to such a martyrdom! He desired

ardently to run to her and to set her free for

the day, for the whole summer, and on full

wages. He wondered if he could trust the

manager with instructions to alleviate her lot....

The next instant she sprang up, giving

the indispensable smile of welcome to some

customer who had evidently entered the

trying-on room from the other side. The

phenomenon distressed him. She disappeared

from view behind the portière, and

reappeared, but only for a moment, talking to

a foppish old man with a white moustache.

It was Senior Polycarp, the lawyer.
Hugo flushed, and, abandoning the manager

in the middle of a sentence, fled to his central

office. He had no confidence in his self-command....

Could this be jealousy?

Was it possible that he, Hugo, should be so

far gone? Nay!
But what was Polycarp, that old and

desiccated widower, doing in the millinery

department?
He said he must form some definite plan,

and begin by giving her a private room.

CHAPTER III
HUGO EXPLAINS HIMSELF
'And what,' asked Hugo, smiling faintly at

Mr. Senior Polycarp—'what is your client's

idea of price?'
For half an hour they had been talking in

the luxurious calm of Hugo's central office,

which was like an island refuge in the middle

of that tossing ocean of business. It overlooked

the court of fountains from the second

story, and the highest jet of water threw a

few jewelled drops to the level of its windows.
Mr. Polycarp stroked his beautiful white

moustache.
'We would give,' he said in his mincing,

passionless voice, 'the cost price of premises,

stock, and fixtures, and for goodwill seven

times your net annual profits. In addition,

we should be anxious to secure your services

as managing director for ten years at five

thousand a year, plus a percentage of profits.'
'Hum!'
'And, of course, if you wished part of the

purchase-money in shares—'
'Have you formed any sort of estimate of

my annual profits?' Hugo demanded.
'Yes—a sort of estimate.'
'You have looked carefully round, eh?'
'My clients have. I myself, too, a little.

This morning, for example. Very healthy,

Mr. Hugo.'
'What departments did you visit this

morning? Each has its busy days.'
'Grocery, electrical, and—let me see—yes,

furniture.'
'Not a good day for that—too hot! Anything

else?'
'No,' said Mr. Polycarp.
'Ah!... Well, and what is your clients'

estimate?'
'Naturally, I cannot pretend—'
'Listen, Mr. Polycarp,' said Hugo, interrupting: 'I

will be open with you.'
The lawyer nodded, appreciatively benign.

As usual, he kept his thoughts to himself, but

he had the air of adding Hugo to the vast

collection of human curiosities which he

had made during a prolonged professional

career.
'My net trading profits last year were

£106,000. You are surprised?'
'Somewhat.'
'You expected a higher figure?'
'We did.'
'I knew it. And the figure might be higher

if I chose. Only I do things in rather a royal

way, you see. I pay my staff five hundred a

week more than I need. And I allow myself

to be cheated.' He laughed suddenly.

'Costume department, for instance. I send

charming costumes out on approval, and

fetch them back in two days. And the pretty

girls who have taken off the tickets, and worn

the garments, and carefully restored the

tickets, and lied to my carmen—the pretty

girls imagine they have deceived me. They

have merely amused me. My detective

reports are excellent reading. And, moreover,

I like to think that I have helped a

pretty girl to make the best of herself.'
'Immoral and unbusinesslike, Mr. Hugo.'
'Admitted. I have no doubt that if I put

the screw on all round I could quite justifiably

increase my profits by fifty per cent.'
'That shows what a splendid prospect a

limited company would have.'
'Yes, doesn't it?' said Hugo joyously.
'But why are your clients so anxious to turn

me into a limited company?'
'They see in your undertaking,' replied

Polycarp, folding his thin hands, 'a legitimate

opening for that joint-stock enterprise which

has had such a beneficial effect on England's

prosperity.'
'They would make a profit?'
'A reasonable profit. A small syndicate

would be formed to buy from you, and that

syndicate would sell to a public company.

The usual thing.'
'And where do I come in?'
'Where do you come in, my dear Mr.

Hugo? Everywhere! You would receive

over a million in cash. You would have your

salary and your percentage, and you would be

relieved of all your present risks.'
'All my present risks?'
'You have risks, Mr. Hugo, because your

business has increased so rapidly that your

income is out of all proportion to your capital,

which consists almost solely of buildings

which you could not sell at anything like their

cost price in open market, and of goodwill.

Now, I ask you, what is goodwill? What is

it? Under our scheme you would at once

become a millionaire in actual fact.'
'Decidedly an inviting prospect,' said Hugo.
He walked about the room.
'Then I may take it that you are at any

rate prepared to negotiate?' the lawyer

ventured, staring at the fountain.
'Mr. Polycarp,' answered Hugo, 'I must

first give you a little information and ask you

a few questions.'
'Certainly.'
Hugo halted in front of Polycarp, close to

him, and, lighting a cigar, gazed down at the

frigid lawyer.
'Till the age of twenty-eight,' he began, 'I

had no object in life. I was educated at

Oxford. I narrowly escaped the legal profession.

I had a near shave of the Church.

I wasted years in aimless travel, waiting for

destiny to turn up. I was conscious of no gift

except a power for organizing. That gift I

felt I had, and gradually I perceived that I

would like to be the head of some large and

complicated undertaking. I examined the

latest developments of modern existence, and

came to the conclusion that the direction of a

thoroughly up-to-date stores would amuse me

as well as anything. So I bought this concern—a

flourishing little drapery and furnishing

business it was then. I had exactly fifty

thousand pounds—not a cent more. I paid

twenty-five thousand for the business. It

was too much, but when an idea takes me it

takes me. I required a fine-sounding name,

and I chose Hugo. It was an inspiration.'
'Then Hugo is not your—'
'It is not. My real name is Owen. But

think of "Owen" on a flag, and then think of

"Hugo" on a flag.'
'Exactly.'
'I began. And because I had everything

to learn I lost money at first. I took lessons

in my own shop, and the course cost me a

hundred a week for some months. But in

two years I had proved that my theory of

myself was correct. In ten I had made

nearly a quarter of a million. Everyone

knows the history of my growth.'
Polycarp nodded.
'In the eleventh year I determined to

emerge from the chrysalis. I dreamed a

dream of my second incarnation as universal

tradesman. And the fabric of my dream,

Mr. Polycarp, you behold around you.' He

waved the cigar. 'It is the most colossal

thing of its kind ever known.'
Polycarp nodded again.
'Some people regard it as extravagant. It

is. It is meant to be. Hugo's store is only

my fun, my device for amusing myself. We

have glorious times here, I and my ten

managers—my Council of Ten. They know

me; I know them. They are well paid; they

are artists. A trade spirit must, of course,

actuate a trade concern; but above that,

controlling that, is another spirit—the spirit

which has made this undoubtedly the greatest

shop in the world. I cannot describe it, but

it exists. All my managers, and even many

of the rank and file, feel it.'
'Very interesting,' said the lawyer.
'Mr. Polycarp,' Hugo announced solemnly,

'the direction of this establishment is my life.

In the midst of this lovely and interesting

organism I enjoy every hour of the day.

What else can I want?'
Polycarp raised his eyebrows.
'Do you suppose it would add to my fun to

have a million in the bank—I, with an income

of two thousand a week? Do you suppose

I should find it diverting to be at the beck and

call of a board of directors—I, the supreme

fount of authority? Do you suppose it would

be my delight to consider eternally the

interests of a pack of shareholders—I, who

consider nothing but my fancy? And, finally,

do you suppose it would amuse me, Hugo, to

have "limited" put after my name? Me,

limited!'
'Then,' said the lawyer slowly, 'I am to

understand you are not willing—'
'My friend,' Hugo replied, dropping into

his chair, 'I would sooner see the whole

blessed place fall like the Bastille than see it

"limited."'
Polycarp rose in his turn.
'My clients,' he remarked in a peculiar

tone, 'had set their minds on this affair.'
'For once in a way your clients will be disappointed,'

said Hugo.
'What do you mean—"for once in a

way"?'
'Who are your clients, Mr. Polycarp?'
'Since the offer is rejected, it would be

useless to divulge their names.'
'I will tell you, then,' said Hugo. 'Your

client—for there is only one—is Louis Ravengar.

I saw it stated in a paper the other day

that Louis Ravengar had successfully floated

thirty-nine companies with a total capitalization

of thirty millions. But my scalp will

not be added to his collection.'
'I shall not disclose the identity of my

clients,' Mr. Polycarp minced. 'But, speaking

of Mr. Ravengar, I have noticed that what

he wants he gets. The manner in which the

United Coal Company, Limited, was brought

to flotation by him in the teeth of the opposition

of the proprietors was really most interesting.'
'You mean to warn me that there are ways

of compelling a private concern to become

public and joint-stock?'
'Not at all, Mr. Hugo. I am incapable of

such a hint. I am sure that nothing and

nobody could force you against your will. I

was only mentioning the case of the Coal

Company. I could mention others.'
'Don't trouble, my dear sir. Convey my

decision to Louis Ravengar, and give him my

compliments. We are old acquaintances.'
'You are?' The solicitor seemed astonished

in his imperturbable way.
'We are.'
'I will convey your decision to my

clients.'
Accepting a cigar, Mr. Polycarp departed.
Without giving himself time to think, Hugo

went straight to Department 42, and direct

to the artist in hats. She stood pale and

deferential to receive him. The heat was

worse than ever.
'Your name is Payne, I think?' he began.

(He well knew her name was Payne.)
'Yes, sir.'
Other employés in the trying-on room

looked furtively round.
'About half-past eleven an old gentleman,

with white moustache, came into this room,

Miss Payne. You remember?'
'Yes, sir.'
'What did he want?'
'He was inquiring about a hat, sir,' she

hurriedly answered.
'For a lady?'
'Yes, sir.'
'Thank you.'
And he hastened back to his central office,

and breathed a sigh. 'I have actually spoken

to her,' he murmured. 'How charming her

voice is!'
But Miss Payne's physical condition desolated

him. If she was so obviously exhausted

at 12.30, what would she be like at the day's

end?'
'I've got it!' he cried.
He seized a pen and wrote: 'Notice.—The

public are respectfully informed that this

establishment will close to-day at two o'clock.'
He rang a bell, and a messenger appeared.
'Take this to the printing-office instantly,

and tell Mr. Waugh it must be posted throughout

the place in half an hour.'
Shortly after two o'clock Sloane Street was

amazed to witness the exodus of the three

thousand odd. The closure was attributed

to a whim of Hugo's for celebrating some

obscure anniversary in his life. Many hundreds

of persons were inconvenienced, and

the internal economy of scores of polite homes

seriously deranged. The evening papers

found a paragraph. And Hugo lost perhaps

a hundred and fifty pounds net. But Hugo

was happy, and he was expectant.
At ten o'clock that night a youngish man,

extremely like Simon Shawn, was brought by

Simon into Hugo's presence under the dome.

This was Simon's brother, Albert Shawn, a

member of Hugo's private detective force.
'Sit down,' said Hugo. 'Well?'
'I reckon you've heard, sir,' Albert Shawn

began impassively, 'the yarn that's going all

round the stores.'
'I have not.'
'Everyone's whispering,' said Albert Shawn,

gazing carefully at his boots, 'that Mr. Hugo

has taken a kind of a fancy to Miss Payne.'
Hugo restrained himself.
'Heavens!' he exclaimed, with a clever

affectation of lightness, 'what next? I've

only spoken to the chit once.'
'Don't I know it, sir!'
'Enough of that! What have you to

report?'
'Miss Payne left at 2.15, whipped round to

the flats entrance, took the lift to the top-floor,

went into Mr. Francis Tudor's flat.'
'What's that you say? Whose flat?'

cried Hugo.
'Mr. Francis Tudor's, sir.'
Mr. Tudor was famous as the tenant of the

suite rented at two thousand a year; he had

a reputation for being artistic, sybaritic, and

something in the inner ring of the City.
'Ah!' said Hugo. 'Perhaps she is a friend

of one of Mr. Tudor's—'
'Servants,' he was about to say, but the

idea of Miss Payne being on terms of equality

with a menial was not pleasant to him, and

he stopped.
'No, sir,' said Albert Shawn, unmoved.

'She is not, because Mr. Tudor shunted out

all his servants soon afterwards. Miss Payne

was shown into his study. She had her tea

there, and her dinner. The Hugo half-guinea

dinner was ordered late by telephone

for two persons, and rushed up at eight

o'clock.'
'I wonder Mr. Tudor didn't order an

orchestra with the dinner,' said Hugo grimly.

It was a sublime effort on his part to be his

natural self.
'I waited for Miss Payne to leave,' continued

Albert Shawn. 'That's why I'm so

late.'
'And what time did she leave?'
'She hasn't left,' said Albert Shawn.

CHAPTER IV
CAMILLA
Hugo dismissed Albert, with orders to continue

his vigil, and then he rang for Simon.
'Do you think I might have some tea?'

he asked.
'I am disposed to think you might, sir,'

said Simon the cellarer. 'It is eight days

since you indulged after dinner.'
'Bring me one cup, then, poured out.'
He was profoundly disturbed by Albert's

news. He was, in fact, miserable. He had

a physical pain in the region of the heart. He

wished he could step off Love as one steps off

an omnibus, but he found that Love resembled

an express train more than an omnibus.
'Can she be secretly married to him?' he

demanded half aloud, sipping at the tea.
The idea soothed him exactly as much as

it alarmed him.
'The question is,' he murmured angrily,

'am I or am I not an ass?... At my

age!'
He felt vaguely that he was not, that he was

rather a splendid and Byronic figure in the

grip of tremendous emotions.
Having regretfully finished the tea, he unlocked

a bookcase, and picked out at random

a volume of Boswell's 'Johnson.' It was the

modern Oxford edition—the only edition

worthy of a true amateur—bound by Rivière.

Like all wise and lettered men, Hugo consulted

Boswell in the grave crises of life, and

to-night he happened upon the venerable

Johnson's remark: 'Sir, I would be content

to spend the remainder of my existence driving

about in a post-chaise with a pretty woman.'
He leaned back in his chair and laughed.

'In the whole history of mankind,' he asserted

to the dome, 'there have only been two

really sensible men. Solomon was one, and

Johnson the other.'
He restored the book to its place, and sat

down to the piano-player, and in a moment

the overture to 'Tannhäuser,' that sublime

failure to prove that passion is folly, filled the

vast apartment. The rushing violin passages,

and every call of Aphrodite, intoxicated his

soul and raised his spirits till he knew with the

certainty of a fully-aroused instinct that

Camilla Payne must be his. He became

optimistic on all points.
'A lady insists on seeing you, sir,' said

Simon Shawn, intruding upon the Pilgrims'

Chant.
'She may insist,' Hugo answered lightly.

'But it all depends who she is. I'm—'
He stopped, for the insisting lady had

entered.
It was Camilla.
He jumped up. Never before in his

career had he been so astounded, staggered,

charmed, enchanted, dazzled, and completely

silenced.
'Miss Payne?' he gasped after a prolonged

pause.
Simon Shawn effaced himself.
'Yes, Mr. Hugo.'
'Won't you sit down?'
The singular prevalence of beautiful women

in England is only appreciated properly by

Englishmen who have lived abroad, and these

alone know also that in no other country

is beauty wasted by women as it is wasted

in England. Camilla was beautiful, and

supremely beautiful; she was tall, well and

generously formed, graceful, fair, with fine

eyes and fine dark chestnut hair; her absolutely

regular features had the proud Tennysonian

cast. But the coldness of Tennysonian

damsels was not hers. Whether she had

Latin blood in her veins, or whether Nature

had peculiarly gifted her out of sheer caprice,

she possessed in a high degree that indescribable

demeanour, at once a defiance and

a surrender, a question and an answer, a

confession and a denial, which is the universal

weapon of women of Latin race in the battle

of the sexes, but of which Englishwomen seem

to be almost deprived. 'I am Eve!' say the

mocking, melting eyes of the Southern woman,

and so said Camilla's eyes. No man could

rest calm under that glance; no man could

forbear the attempt to decipher the hidden

secrecies of its message, and no man could

succeed in the task.
Hugo felt that he had never seen this

woman before.
And he might have been excused for feeling

so; for instead of the black alpaca, Camilla

now wore a simple but effectively charming

toilette such as 'Hugo's' created and sold to

women for the rapture of men in summer twilights,

and over the white dress was thrown

a very rich pearl-tinted opera-cloak, which

only partly concealed the curves of the

shoulders, and poised aslant on the glistening

coiffure was the identical blue hat with its wide

brims that had visited the dome seventeen

hours before. The total effect was calculated,

perfect, overwhelming.
'I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Hugo,' said

Camilla, throwing back her cloak on the left

side with a fine gesture, 'but I am in need of

your assistance.'
'Yes?' Hugo whispered, seating himself.
She had a low voice, rare in a blonde, and

it thrilled him. And she was so near him in

the great chamber!
'I want you to tell me what plot I am in

the midst of. What is the web that has

begun to surround me?'
'Plot?' stammered Hugo. 'Web?'
Her eyes flashed scrutinizingly on his face.
'You have a kind heart,' she said; 'everybody

can see that. Be frank. Do you know,'

she asked in a different tone, 'or don't you,

that you spoke very gruffly to me this

morning?'
'Miss Payne,' he began, 'I assure you—'
'I thought perhaps you didn't know,' she

smiled calmly. 'But you did speak very

gruffly. Now, I have taken my courage in

both hands in order to come to you to-night.

I may have lost my situation through it—I

can't tell. Whether I have lost my situation

or not, I appeal to you for candour.'
'Miss Payne,' said Hugo, 'it distresses me

to hear you speak of a "situation."'
'And why?'
'You know why,' he answered. 'A woman

as distinguished as you are must be perfectly

well aware how distinguished she is, and perfectly

capable, let me add, of hiding her distinction

from the common crowd. For what

purpose of your own you came into my shop,

I can't guess. But necessity never forced

you there. No doubt you meant to avoid

getting yourself talked about; nevertheless,

you have got yourself talked about.'
'Indeed!' She looked at him sideways.
'Yes,' Hugo went on; 'several thousands

of commonplace persons are saying that I

have fallen in love with you. Do you think

it's true, this rumour?'
'How can I tell you?' said she.
'Well, it is true!' he cried. 'It's doubly

and trebly true! It's the greatest truth in

the world at the present moment. It is one

of those truths that a believer can't keep to

himself.' He paused, expectant. 'A woman

less fine than you would have protested

against this sudden avowal, which is only too

like me—too like Hugo. You don't protest.

I knew you wouldn't. I knew you knew.

You asked for candour. You have it. I

love you.'
'Then, why,' she demanded firmly, with a

desolating smile—'why do you have me followed

by your private detective?'
Hugo was caught in a trap. He had hesitated

long before instructing Albert Shawn to

shadow Camilla, but in the end his desire for

exact knowledge concerning her, and his

possession of a corps of detectives ready to

hand, had proved too much for his scruples.

He had, however, till that day discovered

little of importance for his pains—merely that

her parents, who were dead, had kept a small

milliner's shop in Edgware Road, that her

age was twenty-five, that she had come to his

millinery department with a good testimonial

from an establishment in Walham

Green, that she lived in lodgings at Fulham

and saw scarcely anyone, and that she had

once been a typewriter.
'The fact is—'
He stopped, perceiving that the 'fact'

would not do at all, and that to explain to the

woman you love why you have spied on her

is a somewhat nice operation.
'Is that the way you usually serve us?'

pursued Camilla, with a strange emphasis on

the word 'us' which maddened him.
'The fact is, Miss Payne,' he said boldly,

sitting down as soon as he had invented the

solution of the difficulty, 'you will not deny

that this afternoon and this evening you have

been in a position of some slight delicacy.

What your relations are with Mr. Francis

Tudor I have never sought to inquire, but I

have always doubted the bonâ fides of Mr.

Francis Tudor. And to-day I have simply—if

I may say so—watched over you. If my

man has been clumsy, I beg your forgiveness.

I beg you to believe in my deep respect for

you.'
The plain sincerity of his accent and of his

gaze touched and convinced her. She looked

at her feet, white-shod on the crimson carpet.
'Ah!' she murmured, as if to herself,

mournfully, 'why don't you ask me how it

is that I, to whom you pay thirty-six shillings

a week, am wearing these clothes? Surely

you must think that an employé who—'
'At this hour you are not an employé,' he

interrupted here. 'You visit me of your own

free will to demand an explanation of matters

which are quite foreign to our business relations.

I give it you. Beyond that I permit

myself no thoughts except such as any man

is entitled to concerning any woman. You

used the word "plot" when you came in.

What did you refer to? If Mr. Tudor

has—' He could not proceed.
'As I left Mr. Tudor's flat a few minutes

since,' said Camilla quietly, producing a

revolver from the folds of her cloak, 'I picked

up this. It may or may not be loaded.

Perhaps you can tell me.'
He seized the weapon, and impetuously

aimed at a heavy Chinese gong across the

room, and pulled the trigger several times.

The revolver spoke noisily, and the gong

sounded and swung.
'You see!' he exclaimed. 'Pardon the

din. I did it without thinking.'
'Did you call, sir?' asked Simon Shawn,

appearing in the doorway.
Hugo extirpated him with a look.
'How cool you are!' he resumed to Camilla,

and laid down the revolver. 'No, you aren't!

By Jove, you aren't! What is it? What

have you been through? What is this

plot? A plot—in my building—and against

you! Tell me everything—everything! I

insist.'
'Shall you believe all that I say?' she

ventured.
'Yes,' he said, 'all.'
He saw with intense joy that he was going

to be friendly with her. It seemed too good

to be true.

CHAPTER V
A STORY AND A DISAPPEARANCE
'Perhaps I ought to begin by informing you,'

said Camilla Payne, 'that I have known

Mr. Francis Tudor for about two years.

Always he has been very nice to me. Once

he asked me to marry him—quite suddenly—it

was a year ago. I refused because I didn't

care for him. I then saw nothing of him for

some time. But after I entered your service

here, he came across me again by accident.

I did not know until lately that he had one of

your flats. He was very careful, very polite,

timid, cautious—but very obstinate, too. He

invited me to call on him at his rooms, and

to bring any friends I liked. Of course, it

was a stupidity on his part, but, then, what

else could he do? A man who wants to

cultivate relations with a homeless shopgirl

is rather awkwardly fixed.'
'I wish to Heaven you would not talk like

that, Miss Payne!' said Hugo, interrupting her

impatiently.
'I am merely telling you these things so

that you may understand my position,'

Camilla coldly replied. 'Do you imagine

that I am amusing myself?'
'Go on, go on, I beg,' he urged, with a

gesture of apology.
'Naturally, I declined the invitation. Then

next I received a letter from him, in which

he said that unless I called on him, or agreed

to meet him in some place where we could talk

privately and at length, he should kill himself

within a week. And he added that death

was perhaps less to him than I imagined.

I believed that letter. There was something

about it that touched me.'
'And so you decided to yield?'
'I did yield. I felt that if I was to trust

him at all, I might as well trust him fully,

and I called at his flat this afternoon alone.

He was evidently astonished to see me at that

hour, so I explained to him that you had closed

early for some reason or other.'
'Exactly,' said Hugo.
He insisted on giving me tea. I was

treated, in fact, like a princess; but during

tea he said nothing to me that might not have

been said before a roomful of people. After

tea he left me for a few moments, in order, as

he said, to give some orders to his servants.

Up till then he had been extremely agitated,

and when he returned he was even more

agitated. He walked to and fro in that

lovely drawing-room of his—just as you were

doing here not long since. I was a little

afraid.'
'Afraid of what?' demanded Hugo.
'I don't know—of him, lest he might do

something fatal, irretrievable; something—I

don't know. And then, being alone with

him in that palace of a place! Well, he

burst out suddenly into a series of statements

about himself, and about his future, and his

intentions, and his feelings towards me. And

these statements were so extraordinary and so

startling that I could not think he had invented

them. I believed them, as I had

believed in the sincerity of his threat to kill

himself if I would not listen to him.'
'And what were they—these statements?'

Hugo inquired.
Camilla waved aside the interruptions, and

continued: '"Now," he said, "will you

marry me? Will you marry me now?"'
She paused and glanced at Hugo, who

observed that her eyes were filling with

tears.
'And then?' murmured Hugo soothingly.
'Then I agreed to marry him.'
And with these words she cried openly.
'If anyone had told me beforehand,' she

resumed, 'that I should be so influenced by a

man's—a man's acting, I would have laughed.

But I was—I was. He succeeded completely.'
'You have not said what these extraordinary

statements were,' Hugo insisted.
'Don't ask me,' she entreated, drying her

eyes. 'It is enough that I was hoodwinked.

If you have had no hand in this plot, don't

ask me. I am too ashamed, too scornful of my

credulity, to repeat them. You would laugh.'
'Should I?' said Hugo, smiling gravely.

'What occurred next?'
'The next step was that Mr. Tudor asked me

to accompany his housekeeper to the housekeeper's

room, and on the other side of the

passage from the drawing-room I was to dine

with him. The housekeeper is a Mrs. Dant,

a kind, fat, lame old woman, and she produced

this cloak and this hat, and so on, and said

that they were for me! I was surprised, but I

praised them and tried them on for a moment.

You must remember that I was his affianced

wife. I talked with Mrs. Dant, and prepared

myself for dinner, and then I went back to

the drawing-room, and found Mr. Tudor

ready for dinner. I asked him why he had

got the clothes, and he said he had got them

this very morning merely on the chance of

my accepting his proposal out of pity for him.

And I believed that, too.'
There was a silence.
'But that is not the end?' Hugo encouraged

her.
'Oh,' she exclaimed, 'it is useless, all this

story! And the episode is finished! When

I came in here I was angry; I suspect you

of some complicity. But I suspect you no

longer, and I see now that the wisest

course for a woman such as I after such an

adventure is to be mute about it, and to

forget it.'
'No,' he said; 'you are wrong. Trust me.

I entreat.'
Camilla bit her lip.
'We went into the dining-room, and dinner

was served,' she recommenced, 'and there I

had my first shock, my first doubt, for one of

the two waiters was your spy.'
'Shawn! My detective!'
Hugo was surprised to find that Albert,

almost a novice in his vocation, had contrived

to be so insinuating.
'And he made a very bad waiter indeed,'

Camilla added.
'I regret it,' said Hugo. 'He meant well.'

'When the waiters had gone I asked Mr.

Tudor if they were his own servants. He

hesitated, and then admitted frankly that

they were not. He told me that his servants

were out on leave for the evening. "You

don't mean to say that I am now alone with

you in the flat!" I protested. "No," he

said quickly. "Mrs. Dant is always in her

room across the passage. Don't be alarmed,

dearest." His tone reassured me. After

coffee, he took my photograph by flashlight.

He printed one copy at once, and then, after

we had both been in the dark-room together,

he returned there to get some more printing-paper.

While he was absent I went into

the housekeeper's room for a handkerchief

which I had left there. Mrs. Dant was not

in the room. But in a mirror I saw the reflection

of a man hiding behind the door. I was

awfully frightened. However, I pretended

to see nothing, and tried to hum a song. I

same into the passage. The passage window

was open, and I looked out. Another man

was watching on the balcony. Of course, I

saw instantly it was a plot. I—I—'
'Did you recognise the men, then?' Hugo

asked.
'The one in the room I was not quite sure

of. The other, on the balcony, was your

detective, I think. I saw him disappear in

this direction.'
'But whatever the plot was, Shawn had no

hand in it.'
'No, no, of course not! I see now. But

the other, in the room! Ah, if you knew all

my history, you would understand better!

I felt that some vengeance was out against me.

I saw everything clearly. I tried to keep my

head, and to decide calmly what I ought to do.

It was from a little table in the passage that

I picked up the revolver. Then I heard

hurried footsteps coming through the drawing-room

towards the passage. It was Mr.

Tudor. He seemed very startled. I tried

to appear unconcerned. "What is the

matter?" he asked; he had gone quite pale.

"Nothing," I said. "I only went to fetch

a handkerchief." He laughed uneasily. "I

was afraid you had thought better of it and

run away from me," he said. And he kissed

me; I was obliged to submit. All this time

I was thinking hard what to do. I suggested

we should go on to the roof garden for awhile.

He objected, but finally he gave way, and he

brought me the cloak and hat, and we went

to the garden and sat down. I felt safer

there. At last I ventured to tell him that I

must go home. Of course, he objected to that

too, but he gave way a second time. "I

will just speak to Mrs. Dant," I said. "You

stay here for three minutes. By that time I

shall be ready." And I went off towards the

flat, but as soon as I was out of his sight I

turned and ran here. And that's all.'
'You are a wonderful creature,' Hugo murmured,

looking at her meditatively.
'Why?' The question was put with a sort

of artless and melancholy surprise.
'How can I tell?' said Hugo. 'How can

I tell why Heaven made you so?'
She laughed, and the laugh enchanted him.

He had studied her during her recital; he

had observed her continual effort to use

ordinary words and ordinary tones like a

garment to hide vivid sensations and emotions

which, however, shone through the garment

as her face might have shone through a veil.
He recalled her little gestures, inflections,

glances—the thousand avenues by which her

rich and overflowing individuality escaped

from the prison of her will, and impressed

itself on the rest of the created universe. Her

story was decidedly singular, and as mysterious

as it was singular; that something

sinister would be brought to light, he felt sure.

But what occupied and charmed his mind was

the exquisite fact that between him and her

relations were now established. The story,

her past danger, even her possible future

danger—these things only interested him in so

far as they formed the basis of an intimacy.

He exulted in being near her, in the savour of

her commanding presence. When he thought

of her in his monstrous shop, wilting in the

heat, bowing deferentially to fools, martyrizing

her soul for less than two pounds a week,

he thought of kings' daughters sold into

slavery. But she was a princess now, and

for evermore, and she had come to him of her

own free will; she had trusted him; she had

invited his help! It was glorious beyond the

dreams of his passion.
'Come,' he said feverishly, 'show me how

you managed to get to my dome.'
And he threw open the easternmost window,

and she stepped with him out on to the

balcony.
They looked down across Hugo's little

private garden, into the blackness of the court

of fountains, whose balconies were vaguely

disclosed here and there by the reflection from

lit interiors. On the other side of the deep

pit of the court was the vast expanse of flat

roof containing the famous roof garden. Amid

dwarf trees and festoons of coloured lights,

the figures of men and women who counted

themselves the cream of London could dimly

be seen walking about or sitting at tables;

and the wild strain of the Tsigane musicians,

as they swayed to and fro in their red coats

on the bandstand, floated towards the dome

through the heavy summer air. In the near

distance the fantastic shapes of chimney-cowls

raised themselves against the starry but

moonless sky, and miles away the grandiose

contours of a dome far greater than Hugo's—the

dome of St. Paul's—finished the prospect

in solemn majesty. It was a scene well

calculated to intensify a man's emotions,

especially when a man stands to view it, as

Hugo stood, on a lofty balcony, with a beautiful

and loved woman by his side.
She was indicating pathways, as well as

she could, when they both saw a man hurrying

in the direction of the dome along by the roof-balustrade

of the court of fountains—the

route by which Camilla herself had come.

He arrived under the dome, and would have

disappeared into a doorway had not Hugo

called:
'Shawn, I'm here!'
'I was just coming to see you, sir,' replied

Albert Shawn in a loud whisper, as he climbed

breathless up to the little raised garden

beneath the dome.
Camilla withdrew behind a curtain of the

window.
'Well?' Hugo queried.
'She's gone, sir. But dashed if I know

where, unless she's got herself lost somewhere

on the roof.'
'She is here,' said Hugo, lowering his voice.

'And it appears that you waited very clumsily

at that dinner, my boy. A bad disguise is

worse than none. I must lend you Gaboriau's

"Crime of Orcival" to read; that will teach

you. Anything else to tell me?'
'I went back to the balcony entrance of the

flat,' the youthful detective replied humbly,

looking up to Hugo in the window of the

dome. 'I could see through the lacework of

the blind; the drawing-room was empty.

The French window was open an inch or so,

and I could hear a clock ticking as clear as a

bell. Then Mr. Tudor toddled up, and I hid

in the servants' doorway. Mr. Tudor went

in by the other door, and out I popped again

to my post. I see my gentleman stamping

about and calling "Camilla! Camilla!" fit to

burst. No answer. Then he picks up a photograph

off a table and kisses it smack—twice.'
Camilla stirred behind the curtain.
'Then he goes into another room,' proceeded

Albert Shawn, 'and lo and behold!

another man comes from round the corner of

a screen—a man much older than Mr. Tudor!

And Mr. Tudor runs in again, and these

two meet—these two do. And they stare

at each other, and Mr. Tudor says, "Hullo,

Louis—"'
'I knew it!' The cry came from Camilla

within the dome.
'What?' demanded Hugo, turning to her

and ignoring Shawn.
'It was Louis Ravengar whom I saw hiding

behind the door. I felt all the time that it

was he!'
And she put her hands to her face.
'Ravengar!' He was astounded to hear

that name. What had she, what had Tudor,

to do with Ravengar?
'That was why I thought you were in the

plot, Mr. Hugo,' she added.
'Me? Why?'
'Can you ask?'
Her eyes met his, and it was his that

fell.
'I have no relations whatever with Ravengar,

I assure you,' he said gravely. 'But, by

the dagger! I'll see this affair to the end.'

'By the dagger' was a form of oath, meaningless

yet terrible in sound, which Hugo employed

only on the greatest occasions. He

turned sharply to the window. 'Anything

else, Shawn?'
'There was a gust of wind that shut the

blessed window, sir. I couldn't hear any

more, so I came to report.'
'Go to the front entrance of the flat instantly,'

Hugo ordered him. 'I will watch the

balcony.'
'Yes, sir.'
Camilla was crouching in the embrasure of

the window. Her body seemed to shake.
'There is nothing to fear,' Hugo soothed

her. 'Stay here till I return.' And he

snatched up the revolver.
'No,' she said, straightening herself; 'I

must go with you.'
'Better not.'
'I must go with you,' she repeated.
They passed together along the railed edge

of the court of fountains under the stars,

skirted the gay and melodious garden behind

the trees in their huge wooden boxes, and so

came to a second quadrangle, upon whose

highest story the windows of Tudor's flat

gave. Descending a stairway of forged iron

to the balcony, they crept forward in silence

to the window of Tudor's drawing-room, and,

still side by side, gazed, as Shawn had done,

through the fine lacework of the blind into

the splendid apartment.
The window was almost at a corner of the

room, near a door; but Hugo had a perfect

view of the two men within, and one was as

certainly Louis Ravengar as the other was

Francis Tudor. They were gesticulating

violently and angrily, and a heavy, ornate

Empire chair had already been overturned.

The dispute seemed to be interminable; each

moment heralded a fight, but it is the watched

pot that never boils. Suddenly Hugo became

aware that Camilla was no longer at his elbow,

and the next instant, to his extreme amazement,

he saw her glide into the room. She

had removed her hat and cloak, and stood

revealed in all her beauty. The two men

did not perceive her. She softly opened the

window, and the confused murmur of voices

reached Hugo's ear.
'Give me the revolver,' Camilla whispered.
And her whisper was such that he passed

the weapon, as it were hypnotically, to her

under the blind. And then the blind slipped

down, and he could see no more. He heard

a shot, and the next thing was that the revolver

was pushed back to him, nearly at the

level of the floor.
'Wait there!' The sound of her voice,

tense and authoritative, came through the

slit of the window and thrilled him. 'All is

well now, but I will send you a message.'
And the window was swiftly closed and a

curtain drawn behind the blind. He could

hear nothing.
He had small intention of obeying her.

'She must have gone in by the servants'

entrance,' he argued. 'I should have seen

her if she had tried the other.' And he ran

to the small door, but it was shut fast. In

vain he knocked and shook the handle for

several minutes. Then he hastened to the

main door on the broad balcony, but that also

was impregnable.
Should he break a pane?
A noise far along the balcony attracted him.

He flew towards it, found nothing but a cat

purring, and returned. The luscious music of

the Tsigane band, one of the nine orchestras

which he owned, reached him faintly over the

edge of the quadrangle.
Then he decidedly did hear human footsteps

on the balcony. They were the footsteps of

Shawn.
'She's gone, sir. Took the lift, and whizzed

off in Mr. Tudor's electric brougham that was

waiting.'
'And the men?' he gasped.
'Seen neither of them, sir. She put this

note in my hand as she passed me, sir.'

CHAPTER VI
A LAPSE FROM AN IDEAL
'If you please, sir,' said Simon Shawn, when

he brought Hugo's tea the next morning, 'I

am informed that a man has secreted himself

on the summit of the dome.'
Hugo, lying moveless on his back, and

ignoring even the tea, made no reply to this

speech. He was still repeating to himself the

following words, which, by constant iteration,

had assumed in his mind the force and emphasis

of italics: 'So grateful for your sympathetic

help. When next I see you, if there is

opportunity, I will try to thank you. Meantime,

all is well with me. Please trouble no

more. And forget.' Such were the exact

terms of the note from Camilla Payne delivered

to him by Albert Shawn. Of course, he knew

it by heart. It was scribbled very hastily in

pencil on half a sheet of paper, and it bore no

signature, not even a solitary initial. If it

had not been handed to Albert by Camilla in

person, Hugo might have doubted its genuineness,

and might have spent the night in transgressing

the law of trespass and other laws,

in order to be assured of a woman's safety.

But under the circumstances he could not

doubt its genuineness. What he doubted was

its exact import. And what he objected to

in it was its lack of information. He wished

ardently to know whether Ravengar and

Tudor, or either of them, had been wounded,

and if so, by whose revolver; for he could not

be certain that it was Camilla who had fired.

An examination of the revolver which he and

she had passed from hand to hand had shown

two chambers undischarged. He wished

ardently to know how she had contrived to

settle her account with Tudor, and yet get

away in Tudor's brougham, unless it was by

a wile worthy of the diplomacy of a Queen

Elizabeth. And he wished ardently to understand

a hundred and one other things concerning

Camilla, Tudor, and Ravengar, and

the permutations and combinations of these

three, which offered apparently insoluble

problems to his brain. Nevertheless, there

was one assurance which seemed to him to

emerge clearly from the note, and to atone for

its vagueness—a vagueness, however, perfectly

excusable, he reflected, having regard

to the conditions in which it was written—namely,

that Camilla intended to arrive, as

usual, in Department 42 that morning. What

significance could be attached to the phrase,

'When next I see you, if there is opportunity,'

unless it signified that she anticipated seeing

him next in the shop and in the course of

business? Moreover, he felt that it would

be just like Camilla to start by behaving to

him as though nothing had occurred. (But

he would soon alter that, he said masterfully.)

He was, on the whole, happy as he lay in bed.

She knew that he loved her. They had been

intimate. In three hours at most he would

see her again. And his expectations ran high.

Indeed, she had already begun to exist in his

mind as his life's companion.
Simon coughed politely but firmly.
'What's that you say?' Hugo demanded;

and Simon repeated his item of news.
'Ha!' said Hugo; 'doubtless some enthusiast

for sunrises.'
'He has been twice perceived in the little

gallery by the men cleaning the roof garden,'

Simon added.
'And who is it?'
'His identity has not been established,' said

Simon.
'Can't you moderate your language a

little, Shawn?' Hugo asked, staring always

absently up into the dome.
'I beg pardon, sir. I have spent part of

the night with Albert, and his loose speech

always drives me to the other extreme,'

Simon observed, repentant.
'Has Albert seen the burglar?'
'No, sir, if it is a burglar.'
'Well,' said Hugo, 'he's quite safe where he

is. He can't get down except by that door,

can he?' pointing to a masked door, which

was painted to represent a complete set in

sixty volumes of the 'Acts of the Saints.'
'No, sir.'
'And he could only have got up by that

door?' Hugo pursued.
'Yes, sir.'
'Which means that you were away from

your post last night, my son.'
'I was, sir,' Shawn admitted frankly.

'When you and Albert and the lady ran off so

quickly, I followed, as far as I judged expedient—beg

pardon, sir. The man must

have slipped in during my absence. I remember

I noticed the masked door was ajar

on my return. I shut and locked it.'
'That explains everything,' said Hugo.

'You see how your sins find you out.'
'Yes, sir.'
'I say, Shawn,' Hugo cried, as he went to

his bath, 'talking of that chap up above, play

me the Captives' chorus from "Fidelio."'
'It is not in the répertoire, sir,' said Simon,

after searching.
'Not in the répertoire! Impossible!'
'No, sir.'
'Ah well, then, let us have the Wedding

March from "Lohengrin."'
'With pleasure, sir.'
But Simon was unfortunate that morning.

The toilet completed, Hugo came towards

him swinging the gold token, the bearer of

which had the right to take whatever he chose

from all the hundred and thirty-one departments

of the stores in exchange for a simple

receipt.
'I will interview the burglar,' said Hugo.

'But just run down first and get me a pair of

handcuffs.'
In ten minutes Simon returned crestfallen.
'We do not keep handcuffs, sir,' he stammered.
'Not—keep—! What nonsense! First

you tell me that "Fidelio" is not in the répertoire,

and then you have the effrontery to add

that we do not keep handcuffs. Shawn, are

you not aware that the fundamental principle

of this establishment is that we keep everything?

If we received an order for a herd of

white elephants—'
'No doubt our arrangement with Jamrach's

would enable us to supply them, sir,' Simon

put in rapidly. 'But handcuffs seem to be a

monopoly of the State.'
'Evidently, Shawn, you are not familiar

with the famous remark of Louis the Fourteenth.'
'I am not, sir.'
'He said, "L'état, c'est moi." Show me the

catalogue.'
Simon, bearing on his shoulders at that

moment the sins of ten managers, scurried to

bring an immense tome, bound in crimson

leather, and inscribed in gold, 'Hugo, General

Catalogue.' It contained nearly two thousand

large quarto pages, and above six thousand

illustrations. Hugo turned solemnly to the

exhaustive index, which alone occupied

seventy pages of small type, and, running

his finger down a column, he read out,

Handbells, handbell-ringers, handbills, hand-embroidered

sheets, handkerchiefs, handles,

handsaws, hansoms, Hardemann's beetle

powder, hares, haricot beans....'
'Lamentable!' he ejaculated—'lamentable!

You will tell Mr.—Mr. Banbury this

morning to procure some handcuffs, assorted

sizes, at once, and to add them to the—the—Explorers'

Outfit Department.'
'Precisely, sir.'
'In the meantime I shall have to ascend

the dome, and face the burglar without this

necessary of life. Give me the revolver

instead.'

CHAPTER VII
POSSIBLE ESCAPE OF SECRETS
The top of the dome was fashioned into a kind

of belvedere, with a small circular gallery.

Hugo emerged at the head of the stairs, and

saw no living thing; but at the sound of his

footstep a man sprang nervously into view

round the curve of the gallery, and fronted

him.
Hugo, with his hands still on either rail of

the staircase, took the top step, gazing the

while at his burglar, first in wonder, and then

with a capricious abandonment to what he

considered the humour of the situation. He

thought of Albert Shawn's account of the

meeting between Francis Tudor and his visitor

in Tudor's flat on the previous night, and

some fantastic impulse, due to the strain of

Welsh blood in him, caused him to address the

man as Tudor had addressed him:
'Hullo, Louis!'
There was a pause, and then came the reply

in a tone which might have been ferocious or

facetious:
'Well, my young friend?'
It was indeed Louis Ravengar. Dishevelled,

fatigued, and unstrung, he formed a

sinister contrast to Hugo, fresh from repose,

cold water and music, and also to the spirit

of the beautiful summer morning itself, which

at that unspoilt hour seemed always to

sojourn for a space in the belvedere. The sun

glinted joyously on the golden ornament of the

dome, and on Hugo's smooth hair, but it

revealed without pity the stains on Ravengar's

flaccid collar and the disorder of his

evening clothes and opera-hat.
He was a fairly tall man, with thin gray

hair round the sides of his head, but none on

the crown nor on his face, the chief characteristics

of which were the square jaw, the

extremely long upper lip, the flat nose, and

the very small blue-gray eyes. He looked

sixty, and was scarcely fifty. He looked one

moment like a Nonconformist local preacher

who had mistaken his vocation; but he was

nothing of the kind. He looked the next

moment like a good hater and a great scorner

of scruples; and he was.
These two men had not exchanged a word,

had not even seen each other, save at the

rarest intervals, for nearly a quarter of a

century. They were the principals in a

quarrel of the most vivid, satanic, and incurable

sort known to anthropological science—the

family quarrel—and the existence of this

feud was a proof of the indisputable truth

that it sometimes takes less than two to make

a quarrel. For, though Owen Hugo was not

absolutely an angel, Ravengar had made it

single-handed.
The circumstances of its origin were quite

simple. When Louis Ravengar was nine

years old, his father, a widower, married a

widow with one child, aged six. That child

was Hugo. The two lads, violently different

in temperament—the one gloomy and secretive,

the other buoyant and frank—with no

tie of blood or of affection, were forced by

destiny to grow up together in the same house,

and by their parents even to sleep in the same

room. They were never apart, and they loathed

each other. Louis regarded young Owen as

an interloper, and acted towards him as boys

and tigers will towards interlopers weaker

than themselves. The mischief was that

Owen, in course of years, became a great

favourite with his step-father. This roused

Louis to a fury which was the more dangerous

in that Owen had begun to overtake him in

strength, and the fury could, therefore, find

no outlet. Then Owen's mother died, and

Ravengar, senior, married again—a girl this

time, who soon discovered that the household

in which she had planted herself was far too

bellicose to be comfortable. She abandoned

her husband, and sought consolation and

sympathy with another widower, who also

was blessed with offspring. Such is the

foolishness of women. You cannot cure a

woman of being one. But it must be said in

favour of the third Mrs. Ravengar and her

consoler that they conducted their affair with

praiseworthy attention to outward decency.

She went to America by one steamer, and

purchased a divorce in Iowa for two hundred

dollars. He followed in the next steamer,

and they were duly united in Minneapolis.

Meanwhile, the Ravengar household, left to

the ungoverned passions of three males, became

more and more impossible, and at length

old Ravengar expired. In his will he stated

that it was only from a stern sense of justice

that he divided his considerable fortune in

equal shares between Louis and Owen. Had

he consulted his inclination, he would have

left one shilling to Louis, and the remainder

to Owen, who alone had been a true son to

him.
It was a too talkative will. Testators, like

politicians, should never explain.
Louis, who got as a favour half the fortune

of which the whole was, in his opinion, his by

right, was naturally exasperated in the highest

degree by the terms of the indiscreet testament,

and on the day of the funeral he parted

from the son of his step-mother, swearing, in

a somewhat melodramatic manner, that he

would be revenged. Hugo was then twenty-one,

and for twenty-five years he had waited

in vain for symptoms of the revenge.
And now they met again, in the truest

sense strangers. And each had a reason for

humouring the other, for each wanted to

know what the other had to do with Camilla

Payne.
'So you're determined, Louis,' said Hugo

lightly, 'to bring me to my knees about the

transfer of my business to a limited company,

eh?'
'What on earth do you mean, man?'

asked Ravengar, whose voice was always

gruff.
'I refer to Polycarp's visit yesterday.'
'I know nothing of it,' said Ravengar

slowly, looking across the wilderness of roofs.
'Then why are you here, Louis? Is your

revenge at last matured?'
Ravengar controlled himself, and glanced

round as if for unseen aid in a forlorn enterprise.
'Owen,' he said, moved, 'I'm here because

I need your help. I won't say anything

about the past. I know you were always

good-natured. And you've worn better than

I have. I need your help in a matter of

supreme importance to me. I became aware

last night that you and your men were interested

in the proceedings at Tudor's flat. I

ran here, meaning to see you. There was no

one in the big circular room downstairs, and

no one at the entrance. Then I saw your

servant coming, and I retreated through the

door. I wished my presence to be known

only to you. The door was locked on me. I

knocked in vain. Then I stumbled up the

stairs, and found myself out here. I wanted

to calm myself, and here I remained. I knew

your habit of coming up here at early morning.

That is the whole explanation of my

presence.'
Hugo nodded.
'I guessed as much,' he said. 'I will help

you if I can. But first tell me what happened

in the flat last night after Miss Payne entered

while you and Tudor were quarrelling. She

fired on you?'
'No,' said Ravengar; 'I believe she would

have done. It was Tudor who drew a revolver

and fired. Had I had my own—But

I had laid it on a table, like a fool, and

it disappeared.'
'Is not this it?' asked Hugo, producing

Camilla's weapon.
Ravengar nodded, amazed.
'I thought so,' Hugo said, and returned it

to his pocket. 'Were you wounded?'
'It was nothing. A scratch on the wrist.

See! But I left. She—she ordered me to.

And I saw I had no chance. I came out by

the principal door on the balcony while you

were struggling with the servants' door.'
'Wait a moment,' Hugo put in. 'Tudor

knew you were hiding in the flat?'
'Not much!' exclaimed Ravengar. 'I

dropped on him like something out of the

sky. It cost me some trouble to get in. I

had a silly old housekeeper to dispose of.'
Hugo's heart fell.
'Great heavens!' he sighed.
'Why? What's the matter?'
'Nothing. But tell me what you wanted

to get into the flat for at all. What is there

between you and Tudor?'
'Man! he's taken Camilla from me!' The

accents of rage and despair were in Ravengar's

voice as he uttered these words. 'He's taken

her from me! She was my typewriter, you

know. I fell in love with her. We were

engaged!'
Hugo was startled for a moment; then he

smiled bitterly and incredulously. It seemed

too monstrous and absurd that Camilla should

have betrothed herself to this forbidding, ugly,

ageing, and terrible man.
'You were engaged? Never! Perhaps you

aren't aware that she was engaged to Tudor?'
'I tell you we were engaged.'
'She accepted you?'
'Why not? I meant well by the girl.'
'And then she disappeared?'
Hugo spoke with a certain cynicism.
'How do you know?' Ravengar demanded

angrily.
'I only guess.'
'Well, she did. I can't imagine why. I

meant well by her. And the next thing is, I

find her working in your shop, and in the

arms of that scoundrel, Tudor.' He hesitated,

and then, as he proceeded, his tones softened

to an appeal. 'Owen, why were you watching

last night? I must know. It's an affair

of life or death to me.'
Hugo did not believe most of Ravengar's

story, and he perceived the difficulty of his

own position and the necessity for caution.
'I was watching because Miss Payne

thought herself in some mysterious danger,'

he said.
'She came to me, as you have done, to

ask my help. And I won't hide from you

that it was she herself who informed me

definitely that Tudor had invited her to

marry him, and that she had consented.'
'She shall not marry him!' cried Ravengar,

exasperated.
'You are right,' said Hugo. 'She shall

not. I have yet to be convinced even that

he meant to marry her.'
'The rascal! He and I had business relations

for several years before I discovered

who he was. Of course, you know?'
'Indeed I don't,' said Hugo, 'if he isn't

Francis Tudor.'
'He has as much right to the name of

Tudor as you have to the name of Hugo,'

Ravengar sneered. 'He is the son of the

man who dishonoured my father's name by

pretending to marry that woman in Minneapolis.

Even if I hated my father, I've no

cause to love that branch of our complicated

family connections.'
Hugo whistled.
'I did not think there was so much money

there,' he said at length.
'There wasn't. The fellow came into

twenty thousand two years ago, and he has

never earned a cent.'
'Yet he's living at the rate of five thousand

a year at least.'
'It's like him!' Ravengar snorted. 'It's

like him!'
'Perhaps he can't help it,' Hugo said

queerly. 'Everyone isn't like you and me.'
'He can help robbing me of my future

wife!'
'But she left you of her own accord.'
'Owen, she must marry me. It is essential.

You must bring your influence to bear,'

Ravengar burst out wildly. 'She must be

my wife!'
'My dear fellow,' Hugo protested calmly,

'what are you dreaming of? I have no

influence. You talk like a man at his wits'

end.'
There was a silence.
'I am a man at his wits' end,' Ravengar

murmured, half sadly. 'I trusted that girl.

She knows all my secrets.'
'What secrets?' asked Hugo, struck by

the phrase.
'My business secrets, of course. What

else do you fancy?'
'My fancy is too active,' said Hugo, with

careful casualness. 'It runs away with me.

I was thinking of other sorts of secrets, and

of that curious principle of English law that

a wife can't give evidence against her husband....

You must pardon my fancy,'

he added.
'Do you mean to insinuate that my eagerness

to marry Camilla Payne is in order to

prevent her from being able to—'
'No, Louis; I mean to insinuate nothing.

Can't you see a joke?'
'I cannot,' said Ravengar. 'Not that

variety of joke.'
'The appreciation of humour was never your

strong point.'
Something in Hugo's manner made Ravengar

spring forward; then he checked himself.
'Owen,' he entreated, 'don't let's quarrel

again. I beg you to help me. Help me, and

I'll promise never to interfere with you in

your business—I'll swear it.'
'Then it was you, after all, that instructed

Polycarp?'
Ravengar gave an affirmative sign.
'I meant either to get hold of this place or

to ruin you. Remember what I suffered—in

the old days.... You see I'm frank with

you. Help me. We're neither of us growing

younger. I'm mad for that girl, and I

must have her.'
Hugo put his hands into his pockets, and

consulted his toes. This semi-step-brother of

his somehow aroused his compassion.
'No, Louis,' he said; 'I can't.'
'You hate me?'
'Not a bit.'
'Do you think I'm too old to marry, or

what is it?'
'It's just like this, Louis, my friend: I

have every intention of marrying Miss Payne

myself.'
'You!... Ah!... Indeed!'
'I have so decided. And when I decide,

the thing is as good as done.'
'And that's why you were watching last

night! Good! Oh, good! Only I may as

well inform you, Owen, that if Camilla Payne

marries anyone but me, there will be murder.

And no ordinary murder, either!'
Hugo took a turn in the gallery. He felt

genuinely sorry for the gray and desperate

man, driven by the intensity of emotion to

utterances which were merely absurd.
'Louis,' he remarked, with a melancholy

kindliness of tone, 'fate has a grudge against

us two. It ruined our youth, and now it's

embroiling us once more. Can't we both be

philosophical? Can't we contrive to look at

the thing in a—'
'Enough!' Ravengar almost yelled. 'You

always talked that kind of d——d nonsense,

you did! Unless you can arrange to say

you'll give her up, you may as well hold your

tongue.'
'Very well,' said Hugo, 'I'll hold my

tongue.'
'That's all, then?'
'Quite all.'
'I suppose I can go? You'll let me pass?

You'll not exercise your right to treat me as

a burglar?'
'There are the stairs. Pass Shawn boldly.

He is terrible, but he will not eat you.'
'Thanks.'
'And that is the unrivalled company promoter!

And this is life!' Hugo meditated

when he was alone on the dome.
He leaned over the railing of the gallery,

and watched his legions gathering for the

day's battle.

CHAPTER VIII
ORANGE-BLOSSOM
Some two hours later Hugo was in one of the

common rooms devoted to the leisure and

diversion of the legions in the upper basement:

a large and bright apartment, ornamented

with bookcases, wicker chairs, and reproductions

of all that was most uplifting in graphic

art. It was the domain of the ladies engaged

in Departments 30 to 45, and was managed

by an elected committee of their number.

Affixed to the walls, in and out among the

specimens of graphic art, were quite a lot of

little red diamond squares, containing in

white the words, 'Do it now,' in excessively

readable letters. A staff notice about the

early closing of the previous day had been

pinned up near the door, and printed information

relating to a trip to the Isle of Man,

balloting for the use of motor-cars on Sundays,

and a gratis book entitled 'Human Nature in

Shoppers,' were also prominent. Above the

fireplace was a fine mirror, and Hugo was

personally engaged in pasting on the mirror a

fine and effective poster, which ran as follows:
'Interesting. Last year the sales of the

Children's Boot and Shoe Department surpassed

the sales of the Ladies' Ditto by £558.

In the first half of this year, on the contrary,

the sales of the Ladies' Boot and Shoe Department

have surpassed the sales of the Children's

Ditto by £25. Great credit is due to the staff

of the L.B. and S.D. But will the staff of the

C.B. and S.D. allow themselves to be thus

wiped out? That is the question, and Mr.

Hugo will watch for the answer. Managers'

Council, July 10th.'
Hugo, as the supreme head of Hugo's, had

organized his establishment in such a manner

as to leave no regular duties for himself, conformably

to the maxim that a well-managed

business is a business which runs smoothly

and efficiently when the manager is not

managing, and to that other maxim that the

highest aim of the competent manager should

be to make himself unnecessary. Hence he

was perfectly at liberty to be wayward and

freakish in his activities from time to time.

And this happened to be one of his wayward

and freakish mornings. There were, however,

few young women in the common room

to behold his aberration, for the hour was

within two minutes of nine, and at nine o'clock

the latest of the legionaries was supposed to

be at her post. Three girls who were being

hastily served with glasses of milk by a pink-aproned

waitress politely feigned not to see

him. Then another girl ran in, and she, too,

had to pretend that the spectacle of Hugo

pasting posters on mirrors was one of the

most ordinary in life. Hugo glanced at this

last comer in the mirror, and sighed a secret

disappointment.
The interview with Louis Ravengar had

left him less perturbed than might be imagined—at

any rate, as regards Ravengar's own

share in what had occurred and what was to

occur. He was inclined to leave Ravengar

out of the account, and to put the greater

part of his hysterical appeals and threats

down to the effect of a sleepless and highly

unusual night. That Ravengar was absolutely

sincere in his desire to marry Camilla

he did not doubt, and he fully shared the

frenzied man's determination that Camilla

should not marry Francis Tudor. But beyond

this Hugo did not go. He certainly did not

go so far as to believe that Camilla had ever

formally engaged herself to Ravengar. He

thought it just possible that Ravengar might

have committed a crime, or several crimes,

and that Camilla might have knowledge of

them, but the question whether Ravengar

was or was not a criminal appeared to him

to be a little off the point.
The unique point was his own prospects

with Camilla. It may be said that he felt

capable of shielding her from forty Ravengars.
He had torn prudence to shreds, and

stamped on it, that morning, and had gone

down boldly and directly to Department 42

at a quarter to nine, in order to meet Camilla.

And she had not then arrived. He had then

conceived the idea of, and the excuse for, a

visit to the common room, through which

every assistant was obliged to pass on her

way to the receipt of custom. In the whole

history of Hugo's a poster had never before

been known to be posted on a mirror, which

is utterly the wrong place for a poster, but

Hugo had chosen the mirror as the field of

his labours solely that he might surreptitiously

observe every soul that entered the

room.
The clock on the mantelpiece struck

nine, and the last assistant had fled, and

Hugo was left alone with the pink-aproned

waitress, who was collecting glasses on a

tray.
'Has Miss Payne come this morning?' he

asked casually of the girl, patting the poster

like an artist absorbed in his work.
It was a reckless question. He well knew

that in half an hour the whole basement

would be aware that Mr. Hugo had asked

after Miss Payne, but he scorned the whole

basement.
'Miss who, sir?'
'Miss Payne, of the millinery department.'
'A tall young lady, sir?'
'Yes.'
'With chestnut hair?'
'Now you have me,' he lied.
'I fancy I know who you mean, sir; and

now I come to think of it, I don't think she

has.'
The waitress spoke in an apologetic tone,

and looked at the clock with an apologetic

look. She was no fool, that waitress.
'Thank you.'
As he left the room Albert Shawn entered

by the other door, and, perceiving nobody

but the waitress, kissed the waitress, and

was kissed by her heartily.
Hugo's deportment was debonnair, but his

heart had seriously sunk. Just as he had

before been quite sure that Camilla would

come as usual, now he was quite sure that

she would not come as usual. Ever since he

had learnt from Ravengar that Tudor had

been ignorant of Ravengar's presence in the

flat, and that Ravengar had had to 'dispose

of' the housekeeper, a horrid suspicion had

lurked at the back of his mind, and now this

suspicion sprang out upon his hopes of

Camilla's arrival, and fairly strangled them.

And the suspicion was that Camilla had misjudged

Francis Tudor, that his intentions had

throughout been perfectly honourable, and

that on her return to the flat he had quickly

convinced Camilla of this.
In which case, where did he, Hugo, come

in?
As for the terms of the note, he perceived

that he had interpreted them in a particular

way because he wished to interpret them in a

particular way.
He ascended in the direction of Department

42. Perhaps, after all, she had escaped

his vigilance, and was at her duties.
On the way thither he was accosted by a

manager.
'Mr. Hugo.'
'Well, Banbury?'
'I telephoned to New Scotland Yard, but

they refused any information. However, I've

got a pair from the nearest police-station. I

shall order our blacksmiths to make a dozen

pairs to pattern. They will be in next month's

catalogue.'
'I congratulate you, Banbury.'
And he passed on. The early-rising customers

were beginning to invade the galleries,

the cashiers in their confessional-boxes were

settling themselves in their seats, faultless

shopwalkers were giving a final hitch to their

lovely collars, and the rank-and-file were preparing

to receive cavalry. The vast machine

had started, slowly and deliberately, as an

express engine starts. And already the heat,

as yesterday, was formidable. But she would

not suffer to-day; she was not in Department

42.
He went further and further, aimlessly

penetrating to the very heart of the jungle

of departments. He had glimpses of departments

that he had not seen for weeks. At

length he came to the verdant and delicious

Flower Department (hot-house branch), and

by chance he caught a word which brought

him to a standstill.
'What's that?' he asked sharply, of a

salesman in white.
'Order for orange-blossom, sir. A single

sprig only. Rather a curious order, sir.'
'You can supply it?'
'Without doubt, sir.'
'Who is the customer?'
'Mr. Francis Tudor,' replied the salesman,

looking at a paper. 'No. 7, the Flats.'
'Ah yes,' he said; and thought: 'My life

is over.'
He gazed with unseeing eyes into the green

and shady recesses of the palmarium, where

water trickled and tinkled.
What was the power, the influence, the

lever, which Francis Tudor was using to

induce Camilla to marry him—him whom,

on her own statement, she did not love?

And could Louis Ravengar be in earnest,

after all, with his savage threats?

CHAPTER IX
'WHICH?'
'And when I decide, the thing is as good as

done.' Those proud, vain words of his,

spoken to Louis Ravengar with all the arrogance

of a man who had never met Fate like

a lion in the path, often recurred to Hugo's

mind during the next few weeks. And their

futility exasperated him. He had decided to

win Camilla, and therefore Camilla was as

good as won! Only, she had been married

on the very morning of those boastful words

by license at a registry-office to Francis Tudor.

The strange admixture of orange-blossom and

registry-office was not the only strange thing

about the wedding. It was clear, for example,

that Tudor must have arranged the preliminaries

of the ceremony before the bride's consent

had been obtained—unless, indeed,

Camilla had garbled the truth to Hugo on

the previous night; and Hugo did not believe

this to be possible.
Albert Shawn had brought the news hour

by hour to Hugo.
After the wedding, the pair drove to Mr.

Tudor's flat, where Senior Polycarp paid

them a brief visit.
Then Hugo received by messenger a note

from Tudor formally regretting that his wife

had left her employment without due notice,

and enclosing a cheque for the amount of a

month's wages in lieu thereof.
And then Mr. and Mrs. Tudor had departed

for Paris by the two-twenty Folkstone-Boulogne

service from Charing Cross. And

the gorgeous flat was shut up.
Albert Shawn had respectfully inquired

whether there remained anything else to be

done in the affair, far more mysterious to

Albert than it was even to Hugo.
'No,' Hugo had said shortly.
He was Hugo, with extraordinary resources

at hand, but a quite ordinary circumstance,

such as ten minutes spent in a registry-office,

will sometimes outweigh all the resources in

the world when the success of a scheme hangs

in the balance.
What could he do, in London or in Paris,

civilized and police-ridden cities?
Civilization left him but one thing to do—to

acknowledge his defeat, and to mourn the

incomparable beauty and the distinguished

spirit which had escaped his passionate grasp.

And to this acknowledgment and this mourning

he was reduced, feeling that he was no

longer Hugo.
It was perhaps natural, however, that his

employés should have been made to feel that

he was more Hugo than ever. For a month

he worked as he had never worked before,

and three thousand five hundred people, perspiring

under his glance and under the sun of

a London August, knew exactly the reason

why. The intense dramatic and sentimental

interest surrounding Camilla Payne's disappearance

from Department 42 was the sole

thing which atoned to the legionaries for the

inconvenience of Hugo's mistimed activity.
Then suddenly he fell limp; he perceived

the uselessness of this attempt to forget in

Sloane Street, and he decided to try the banks

of a certain trout-stream on Dartmoor. He

knew that with all the sun-glare of that season,

and the water doubtless running a great deal

too fine, he would be as likely to catch trout

on Dartmoor as on the Thames Embankment;

but he determined to go, and he announced his

determination, and the entire personnel, from

the managers to the sweepers, murmured

privily, 'Thank Heaven!'
The moment came for the illustrious departure.

His electric coupé stood at his private

door, and his own luggage and Simon Shawn's

luggage—for Simon never entrusted his master

to other hands—lay on the roof of the coupé.

Simon, anxiously looking at his watch, chatted

with the driver. Hugo had been stopped on

emerging from the lift by the chief accountant

concerning some technical question. At

length he came out into the street.
'Shaving it close, aren't we, Simon?' he

remarked, and sprang into the vehicle, and

Simon banged the door and sprang on to the

box, and they seemed to be actually off,

much to the relief of Simon, who wanted a

holiday badly.
But they were not actually off. At that

very instant, as the driver pulled his lever,

Albert Shawn came frantically into the scene

from somewhere, and signalled the driver to

wait. Simon cursed his brother.
'Mr. Hugo,' Albert whispered, as he put

his head into the coupé.
'Well, my lad?'
'I suppose you've heard? They've turned

up again at the flat. Yes, this morning.'
'Who have turned up again?'
'That's the point, sir. Some of 'em. And

there's been a funeral ordered.'
'A funeral? Whose funeral? From us?
'Yes, sir; but whose—that's another point.

You see, I've just run along to let you know

how far I've got. Not that you gave me

any instructions. But when I heard of a

funeral—'
'Is it a man's or a woman's?' Hugo demanded,

thinking to himself: 'I must keep

calm. I must keep calm.'
'Don't know, sir.'
'But surely the order-book—'
'No order for coffin, sir. Merely the cortège;

day after to-morrow; parties making

their own arrangements at cemetery. Brompton.'
'And did none of the porters see who

arrived at the flat this morning?'
'None of 'em knows enough to be sure,

sir.'
'Well,' said Hugo, 'there isn't likely to be

a funeral without a coffin, and no porter could

be blind to a coffin going upstairs.'
'I can't get wind of any coffin, sir.'
'And that's all you've learnt?'
'That's the hang of it, sir—up to now.

But I can wire you to-night or to-morrow,

with further particulars.'
Hugo glanced at the carriage-clock in front

of him, and thought of the famine of porters

at Waterloo Station in August, and invented

several other plausible excuses for a resolution

which he foresaw that he was about to

arrive at.
'You've made me miss my train,' he said,

pretending to be annoyed.
'Sorry, sir. Simon, the governor isn't

going.'
Simon descended from the box for confirmation,

a fratricide in all but deed.
'Have the luggage taken upstairs,' Hugo

commanded.
He sat for seven hours in the dome, scarcely

moving.
At nine o'clock Albert was announced.
'Coffin just come up, sir,' he said, 'from

railway-station.'
But that was the limit of his news.
Within an hour Hugo went to bed. He

could not sleep; he had known that he could

not sleep. The wild and savage threat of

Louis Ravengar, and the question, 'Which?'

haunted his brain. At one o'clock in the

morning he switched on all the lights, rose

out of bed, and walked aimlessly about the

chamber. Something, some morbid impulse,

prompted him to take up the General Catalogue,

which lay next to a priceless copy of

the 1603 edition of Florio's 'Montaigne.'

There were pages and pages about funerals in

the General Catalogue, and forty fine photographic

specimens of tombstones and monuments.
'Funerals conducted in town or country....

Cremations and embalmments undertaken....

Special stress is laid on the

appearance and efficiency of the attendants,

and on the reverent manner in which they

perform all their duties.... A shell finished

with satin, with robe, etc.... All necessary

service.... A hearse (or open car, as preferred)

and four horses, three mourning

coaches, with two horses each. Coachmen

and attendants in mourning, with gloves.

Superintendent, £38.... Estimates for cremation

on application.... Broken column,

in marble, £70. The same, with less carving,

£48.' And so on, and so on; and at the top

of every page: 'Hugo, Sloane Street, London.

Telegraphic address: "Complete, London."

Hugo, Sloane Street, London. Telegraphic

address: "Complete, London." Hugo—'
Whom was he going to bury the day after

to-morrow—he, Hugo, undertaker, with his

reverent attendants of appearance guaranteed

respectable?
The great catalogue slipped to the floor with

a terrible noise, and Simon Shawn sprang out

from his lair, and stopped at the sight of his

master in pyjamas under the full-blazing

electric chandelier.
'All serene,' said Hugo; 'I only dropped

a book. Go to sleep. Perhaps we may reach

Devonshire to-morrow,' he added kindly.
He sympathized with Simon.
'Yes, sir.'
He thought he would take a stroll on the

roof; it might calm his nerves.... Foolishness!

How much wiser to take a sedative!
Then he turned to the Montaigne, and after

he had glanced at various pages, his eye encountered

a sentence in italics: 'Wisdome

hath hir excesses, and no lesse need of moderation,

than follie.'
'True,' he murmured.
He dressed, and went out.

CHAPTER X
THE COFFIN
He was in that mental condition, familiar to

every genuine man of action, in which, though

the mind divides against itself, and there is

an apparently even conflict between two impulses,

the battle is lost and won before it is

fought, and the fight is nothing but a sham

fight. He wandered about the roofs; he

went as far as the restaurant garden, and

turned on all the electric festoons and standards

by the secret switch, and sat down

solitary at a table before an empty glass

which a waiter had forgotten to remove. He

extinguished the lights, wandered back to the

dome, climbed to the topmost gallery, and

saw the moon rising over St. Paul's Cathedral.

He said he would go to bed again at once,

well knowing that he would not go to bed

again at once. He swore that he would conquer

the overmastering impulse, well knowing

that it would conquer him. He cursed, as

men only curse themselves. And then, suddenly,

he yielded, gladly, with relief.
He hastened out, and did not pause till he

reached the balcony of flat No. 7 in the further

quadrangle. He admitted frankly now that

the dominant impulse which controlled his

mind would force him to enter the flat during

that night, by means lawful or unlawful, and

he perceived with satisfaction that the great

French window of the drawing-room was not

quite shut. The blinds, however, had been

carefully lowered, and nothing of the interior

was revealed save the fact that a light burned

within. In the entire quadrangle, round

which, tier above tier, hundreds of people

were silent in sleep or in vigil, this was the

sole illumination. Hugo leaned over the

balcony, and tried to pierce the depths of

the vast pit below, and those thoughts came

to him which come to watchers by night in

the presence of sleeping armies, or on the

high sea. The eternal and insoluble question

troubled and teased him, and would not be

put aside. In imagination, he felt the very

swish of the planet as it whirled through space

with its cargo of pitiful humanity. What,

after all, were life, love, ambition, grief,

death? What, in the incessant march of

suns, could be the value of a few restless

specks of vitality clinging with desperation

to a minor orb?
And then he fancied he could hear a sound

within the flat, and he forgot these transcendental

speculations, and for him the secret of

the universe lay behind the blinds of Francis

Tudor's drawing-room. Yes, he could hear a

sound. It was the distant sound of a man

talking—loudly, slowly, and distinctly—but

too far off for him to catch even one word.

He guessed, as he pushed the window a little

wider open, and bent his ear to the aperture,

that the voice must be in a room beyond the

drawing-room. It continued monotonously

for a long time, with little breaks at rare intervals;

it was rather like a parson reading

a sermon in an empty church. Then it

ceased. And there were footsteps, which

approached the window, and retired. He

noticed that the light within the room was

being moved, but it cast no human shadow

on the blind. The light came finally to a

standstill, and then there followed sounds

which Hugo could not diagnose—short, regular

sounds, broken occasionally by a sharp

clash, as of an instrument falling. And

when these had come to an end, there were

more footsteps—a precise, quick walking to

and fro, which continued for ages of time.

Lastly, the footsteps receded; something

dropped, not heavily, but rather in a manner

gently subsiding, and a groan (or was it a

moan, a tired suspiration?) wakened in Hugo's

spinal column a curious, strange thrill. Then

silence, complete, definitive, terrifying.
By merely pushing the window against the

blind, he could enter and know the secret of

the universe.
'Why am I doing this?' he asked himself,

while he pushed the window. 'Why have I

done this?' he asked himself, as he stood

within the immense and luxurious room.
He gazed round with a swift and timid

glance, as a man would who expects to see

that which ought not to be seen. To his left

was the fireplace, with a magnificent mirror

over it. On the mantelpiece burned a

movable electric table—lamp, with twin

branched lights. He observed the silk-covered

cord lying across the mantelpiece

and disappearing over the further edge; by

the side of the lamp was a screwdriver.

Exactly in front of the lamp, on a couple of

trestles such as undertakers use, lay an elm

coffin, its head towards the mantelpiece. At

the opposite end of the room was another

fireplace and another mirror, with the result

that Hugo saw an endless succession of

coffins and corpse-lights, repeated and repeated,

till they were lost in a vague crystal

blur, and by every pair of corpse-lights was a

screwdriver.
He stood moveless, and listened, and could

detect no faintest sound. Across the room

from the principal window there was a doorway

with a heavy portière; not a fold of the

portière stirred. To his right, near the other

window, was a door—the door by which

Camilla had entered that night a month ago;

it was shut. His glance searched among the

rich confusion of furniture—fauteuils, occasional

tables, sofas, statuary, vases, cabinets.

He peered into every corner of the silent

chamber, and saw nothing that gave a sign

of life. He even gazed up guiltily at the

decorated ceiling, as though some Freemason's

Eye might be scanning him from above.
The coffin reigned in the room; all else was

subservient to its massive and sinister presence,

and the bright twin-lamps watched over

its majesty with dazzling orbs.
Hugo went near the coffin, stepping on tip-toe

over the thick-piled rugs, and examined

it. There was no name-plate. He looked at

himself in the mirror, and again he murmured

a question: 'Why am I here?' Then he

listened attentively, fearfully. No sound.

His hands travelled to the screwdriver on

the mantelpiece, and then fifty of his hands

picked up fifty screwdrivers. And he listened

once more. No sound.
'I must do it. I must,' he thought.
The next moment he was unscrewing the

screws in the lid of the coffin, and scarcely

had he begun the task when he realized that

what he had heard from the balcony was the

screwing of these same screws. There were

twelve, and some of them were difficult to

start, but in due course he had removed them

all, and they stood in a row on their heads

on the mantelpiece. He listened yet again.

No sound. He had only to push the lid of

the coffin to the left or to the right, or to

lift it up. He spent several seconds in deciding

whether he should push or lift, and

then at length fifty Hugos lifted bodily the

lids of fifty coffins. And after a dreadful

hesitation he lowered his gaze and looked.
Yes, it was Camilla! He had known

always that it would be Camilla.
The pale repose of death only emphasized

the proud and splendid beauty of that head,

with its shut eyes, its mouth firmly closed in

a faint smile, and its glorious hair surrounded

by all the white frippery of the shroud. Here

lay the mortal part of the incomparable

creature who had been coveted by three men

and won by one—for a few brief days' possession.

Here lay the repository of Ravengar's

secrets, the grave of Hugo's happiness,

the dead mate of Tudor's desire. Here lay

the eternal woman, symbol of all beauty and

all charm, victimized by her own loveliness.

For if she had not been lovely, thought Hugo,

if the curves of her cheek and her nostrils and

the colour of her skin had been ever so slightly

different, the world might have contained one

widower, one ruined heart, and one murderer

the less that night.
He did not doubt, he could not doubt, after

Ravengar's threats, that she had been murdered.

And yet he was not angry then. He

did not feel a great grief. He was conscious

of no sensation save a numbed and desolate

awe. He had not begun to feel. Ledging

the lid crossways on the coffin, he placed his

hand gently upon Camilla's brow. It was

colder than he had expected, and it had the

peculiar hard, inelastic touch of incipient

decay—that touch which communicates a

shudder even to the most impassive.
'I must go,' he whispered, staring spell-bound

at her face.
He was surprised to find drops of moisture

falling on the shroud. They were his tears,

and yet he had not known that he was

crying.
He hid her again beneath the elm plank,

and, taking the screws one by one from the

mantel-piece, shut her up for ever from any

human gaze. And then, nearly collapsing

under a nervous tension such as he had never

before experienced, he turned to leave the

apartment as he had entered it, like a thief.

But the mystery of the heavy velvet portière

invincibly attracted him. His steps wavered

towards it. He fancied he saw something

dark protruding under the curtain, and he

pulled the curtain aside with a movement

almost hysteric. A man lay extended at full

length on his chest in the passage beyond—what

Hugo had noticed was his boot.
'Tudor!' he exclaimed, kneeling to examine

the half-concealed face.
At the same moment a figure came quietly

down the passage. Hugo looked up, and

saw a sallow-featured man of about thirty-five

in a tourist suit, with light beard and hair,

and long thin hands.
'What is this?' asked the stranger evenly.

'Who are you?'
'My name is Hugo,' Hugo answered with

assurance. 'I was walking along the balconies,

as I do sometimes at night, and I

heard strange sounds here, and as the window

was open I stepped in and found this. Are

you a friend of Mr. Tudor's?'
The other bent in his turn, and after

examining the prone body said:
'I was. He has no friends now.'
'You mean he is dead?'
'He must have died within the last quarter

of an hour or so.'
'And nothing can be done?'
'Nothing can be done with death!'
'I take it you are a doctor?' said Hugo.
'My name is Darcy,' the other replied.

'Besides being Tudor's friend, I was his

physician.'
'Yet even for a physician,' Hugo pursued,

'it seems to me that you have been able to

decide very quickly that your friend and

patient is dead. I have always understood

that to say with assurance that death has

taken place means a very careful and thorough

examination.'
'You are right,' Darcy agreed, stroking his

short, bright, silky beard. 'There is only

one absolute proof of death.'
'And that is?'
'Putrefaction. Nevertheless, the inquest

will show whether or not I have been in error.'
'There will have to be an inquest?'
'Certainly. In such a case as this no

doctor in his senses would give his certificate

without a post-mortem, and though I am an

enthusiast, I am in my senses, Mr. Hugo.'
'An enthusiast?'
'Let me explain. My friend Tudor was

suffering from one of the rarest of all maladies—malignant

disease of the heart. The text-books

will tell you that malignant disease of

the heart has probably never been diagnosed.

It is a disease of which there are no symptoms,

in which the patient generally suffers no pain,

and for which there is no treatment. Nevertheless,

in my enthusiasm, I have diagnosed

in this case that a very considerable extent of

the cardiac wall was affected by epithelioma.

We shall see. Not long since I condemned

Tudor to an early and sudden death—a death

which might be hastened by circumstances.'
'Poor chap!' Hugo murmured.
The dead man looked so young, artless, and

content.
'Why "poor"?' Darcy turned on him

sharply but coldly. 'Is not a sudden death

the best? Would you not wish it for yourself,

for your friends?'
'Yes,' said Hugo; 'but when one is dead

one is dead. That's all I meant.'
'I have heard much of you, Mr. Hugo,'

said the other. 'And, if I may be excused a

certain bluntness, it is very obvious that,

though you say little, you are no ordinary

man. Can it be possible that you have lived

so long and so fully and are yet capable of

pitying the dead? Have you not learnt that

it is only they who are happy?' He vaguely

indicated the corpse. 'If you will be so good

as to assist me—'
'Willingly,' said Hugo, who could find

nothing else to say. 'I suppose we must

call the servants?'
'Why call the servants? To begin with,

there is only one here, a somewhat antique

housekeeper. Let her sleep. She has been

through sufficient to-day. Morning will be

time enough for the futile formalities which

civilization has invented to protect itself.

Night, which is the season of death, should

not be disturbed by them.'
'As you think best,' Hugo concurred.
'And now,' Darcy began, in a somewhat

relieved tone, when he had finished his task,

and the remains of Francis Tudor lay decently

covered on a sofa in the drawing-room, that

mortuary chamber, 'will you oblige me by

coming into the study for a while? I am not

in the mood for sleep, and perhaps you are

not. And I will admit frankly that I should

prefer not to be alone at present. Yes,' he

added, with a faint deprecatory smile, 'my

theories about death are thoroughly philosophical,

but one cannot always act up to

one's theories.'
And in the study, at the other end of the

flat, far from the relics of humanity, he began

to roll cigarettes with marvellous swiftness in

his long thin fingers.
Hugo surmised that under his singular and

almost glacial calm the man concealed a temperament

highly nervous and sensitive.
'You do not inquire about the—the coffin?'

said Darcy at length, when they had smoked

for a few moments in silence.
As a fact, Hugo had determined that, at no

matter what cost to his feelings, he would

not be the first to mention the other

fatality.
The two men looked at each other, and

each blew out a lance of smoke.
'What did she die of?' Hugo demanded

curtly.
'You are aware, then, who it is?'
'Naturally, I guessed.'
'Ah! she died of typhoid fever. You

knew her?'
'I knew her.'
'Of course; I remember. She was in your

employ. Yes,' he sighed; 'she contracted

typhoid fever in Paris. It's always more or

less endemic there. And what with this hot

summer and their water-supply and their

drainage, it's been more rife than usual lately.

Tudor called me in at once. I am qualified

both in England and France, but I practise

in Paris. It was a fairly ordinary case,

except that she suffered from severe and

persistent headaches at the beginning. But

in typhoid the danger is seldom in the fever;

it is in the complications. She had a hæmorrhage.

I—I failed. A hæmorrhage in typhoid

is not necessarily fatal, but it often proves so.

She died from exhaustion.'
'I thought,' said Hugo, in a low, unnatural

voice, 'that typhoid marked the patient—spots

on the face.'
'Not invariably. Oh no; but why do you

say that?'
'I only meant that I hope her face was not

marked.'
'It was not. You mean that you hope her

face was not marked because she was so

beautiful?'
'Exactly,' said Hugo. 'And so Tudor

brought the body over to England for burial?'
'Yes; he insisted on that. And he insisted

on my coming with him. I could not refuse.'
'And now he, too, is gone! Tell me, was

he expecting it—his own death?'
Darcy lighted another cigarette.
'Who can say?' he observed to the ceiling.

'Who can say what premonitions such a man

may not have had?'
'I heard talking before I came into the flat

from the balcony,' said Hugo abruptly. 'It

went on for a long time. Was it you and he?'
'No,' the doctor replied; 'I was in here,

writing.' He pointed to some papers on a

desk. 'I did not even hear him fall.'
'Yet you heard me?'
'No, I didn't. I was just coming to find

out what Tudor was doing when I saw you.'
'It is curious that I heard talking, and

walking about, too.'
'Possibly he was talking to himself. Did

you hear two voices?'
'Perhaps I heard only one.'
'Then no doubt he was talking to himself.

You won't be surprised to learn that he had

been in an excessively emotional condition all

day.... It is all very sad. Only a month

ago, and Tudor was—but what am I saying?

Who knows what perils and misfortunes he—they—may

not have escaped? For my part,

I envy—yes, I envy Tudor.'
'But not her? You do not envy her? In

your quality of philosophy, you regret her

death?'
'Do not ask me to be consistent,' said the

philosopher, after a long pause.
Hugo rose and approached Darcy.
'Are you acquainted with a man named

Louis Ravengar?' he demanded in a rather

loud tone.
The doctor scanned his face.
'I have heard Tudor mention the name,

but I do not know him.'
'And upon my soul I believe you,' cried

Hugo. 'Nevertheless—'
'Nevertheless what?'
Darcy seemed startled. Hugo's strange

outburst was indeed startling.
'Oh, nothing!' Hugo muttered. 'Nothing.'

He walked to the window, which looked out

on Blair Street. The first heralds of the

dawn were in the eastern sky, and the moon

overhead was paling. 'It will be daylight

in a minute,' he said. 'I must go. Come

with me first to the drawing-room, will you?'
And they passed together along the passage

to the drawing-room, where the electric lamp

was still keeping watch. Hugo stood by the

side of the coffin.
'What is it?' Darcy quietly asked.
'Have you ever been in love?' Hugo questioned

him.
'Yes,' said Darcy.
'Then I will tell you. You will understand.

I must tell someone. I loved her.'
He touched the elm-wood gently, and hurried

out of the room by the French window.

Four days later Mr. Senior Polycarp called

on Hugo in his central office.
In the meantime the inquest had proved

the correctness of Mr. Darcy's diagnosis.

Francis Tudor was buried, and Francis Tudor's

wife was buried. Hugo, who had accompanied

the funerals disguised as one of his own

'respectful attendants,' saw scarcely anyone.

He had to recover the command of his own

soul, and to adopt some definite attitude

towards the army of suspicions which naturally

had assailed him. Could he believe Darcy?

He decided that he could, and that he must.

Darcy had inspired him with confidence, and

there was no doubt that the man had an extensive

practice in Paris, and was well known

at the British Embassy. Camilla, then, had

really died of typhoid fever on her honeymoon,

and hence Ravengar had not murderously

compassed her death. And people did die of

typhoid fever, and people did die on their

honeymoons.
Either Ravengar's threats had been idle, or

Fate had mercifully robbed him of the opportunity

to execute them. Hugo remembered

that he had begun by regarding the threats as

idle, and that it was only later, in presence of

Camilla's corpse, that he had thought otherwise

of them. So he drove back the army of

suspicions, and settled down to accustom himself

to the eternal companionship of a profound

and irremediable grief.
Then it was that Polycarp called.
'I come to you,' said the white-moustached

solicitor, 'on behalf of my late client, Mr.

Tudor. He made his will after his marriage,

and before starting for Paris, and it contains a

peculiar clause. Mr. Tudor had the flat on a

three years' agreement, renewable at his option

for a further period of two years. Over two

years of the three are expired.'
'That is so,' said Hugo. 'You want to

get rid of the tenancy at once? Well, I

don't mind. I can easily—'
'No,' Polycarp interrupted him, 'I wish to

give notice of renewal. The will provides that

if the testator should die within two months

of the date of it the flat shall be sealed up

exactly as it stands for twelve months after

his death, and that the estate shall be held

by me, as executor and trustee, for that

period, and then dealt with according to

instructions deposited in the testator's private

safe in the vault which I rent from you in

your Safe Deposit.'
'But—'
'I have just sealed up the flat—doors,

windows, ventilators, everything.'
'Mr. Polycarp, this is impossible.'
'Not at all. It is done.'
'But the reason?'
'I know no more than yourself. As executor,

I have carried out the terms of the

will. I thought that you, as landlord, were

entitled to the information which I have

given you.'
'As landlord,' said Hugo, 'I object. And

I shall demand entrance.'
'On what ground?'
'Under the clause which in all tenancy

agreements gives the landlord the right to

enter at reasonable times in order to inspect

the condition of the premises,' Hugo answered

defiantly to the lawyer.
'I had considered that. But I shall dispute

the right. You may bring an action. What

then? No court will give you leave to force

an entrance. An Englishman's furnished flat,

just as much as his house, is his castle. I

could certainly keep you out for a year.'
'And may I ask why you are so anxious to

keep me out, Mr. Polycarp?'
'I am anxious merely to fulfil my duties.

May I ask why you are so anxious to get in?

Why do you want to thwart the wishes of a

dead man?'
'I could not permit that mystery to remain

for a whole year in the very middle of my

block of flats.'
'What mystery?' Polycarp suavely inquired.
During this brief conversation all Hugo's

suspicions had hurriedly returned, and he had

examined them anew and more favourably.

Polycarp? Was it not curious that Polycarp

should be acting for both Ravengar and

Tudor?... Darcy? Were there not very

strange features in the behaviour of this

English doctor who preferred to practise in

Paris?... And the hæmorrhage? And,

lastly, this monstrous, unaccountable, inexplicable

shutting-up of the flat?
He felt already that those empty rooms,

dark, silent, sealed, guarding in some recess

he knew not what dreadful secret, were getting

on his nerves. And was he to suffer for a

year?
'Come, Mr. Hugo,' said Polycarp; 'I may

count on your goodwill?'
'I don't know,' Hugo replied—'I don't

know.'

PART II
THE PHONOGRAPH

CHAPTER XI
SALE
Strange sights are to be seen in London.
At five minutes to nine a.m. on the first day

of the year seven vast crowds stood before the

seven principal entrances to Hugo's; seven

crowds of immortal souls enclosed in the

bodies of women. They meant to begin the

year well by an honest attempt to get something

for nothing. It was a cold, dank, raw,

and formidable morning; Hugo's tessellated

pavements were covered with moisture, and,

moreover, day had not yet conquered night.

But the seven crowds, growing larger each

moment, recked nothing of these inconveniences.

They waited stolidly, silently, in a

suppressed and dangerous fever, as besiegers

await the signal for an attack. Between the

various entrances, on the three façades of the

establishment, ran the long lines of windows

dressed with all the materials for happiness,

and behind these ramparts of materials could

be glimpsed Hugo's assistants moving about

in anxious expectation under the electric

lights, which burned red in the foggy gloom.

Over every portal was a purple warning:

'Beware of pickpockets, male and female.'

No possible male pickpockets, however, were

visible to the eye; perhaps they were disguised

as ladies. The seven crowds wedged

themselves closer and closer, clutched tighter

and tighter their purses, and stared at the

golden commissionaires through the glass

doors with a glance more and more ferocious.

Then suddenly something went off with a

boom; it was the first stroke of the great

Hugo clock under the dome. Six pairs of

double doors opened simultaneously, six pairs

of golden commissionaires were overthrown

like ninepins, and in a fraction of time six

companies of determined and remorseless

women had swept like Prussian cavalry into

the interior of the doomed edifice.
But the seventh crowd was left on the

pavement, for the seventh pair of doors had

not opened. And this was the more extraordinary

in that the seventh crowd was the

largest crowd, and stood before the entrance

nearest to the principal scene of the day's

operations. Instantly the world became

aware that Hugo's management was less

perfect than usual, and people recalled incidents

in his business during the previous four

months which had not been to his credit.

The seventh crowd was staggered, furious,

and homicidal. If glances could have killed

the impassive pair of golden commissionaires

behind the seventh portal, they would certainly

have fallen down dead. If the glass

of the seventh portal had not been set in

small squares of immense thickness, it would

have been shattered to bits, and the stronghold

forced. Many women cried out that

justice had come to an end in England, for

was it not an elementary principle of justice

that all doors should open together? A few

women, more practical, and near the edge of

the enraged horde, slipped away to other

entrances. One woman fainted, but she was

held upright by the press, and as no one paid

the slightest attention to her she rapidly came

to. Then at length a tall gentleman in a

beautiful 

frock-coat was seen to be expostulating sternly with the seventh 

pair of golden commissionaires; the recalcitant doors flew open,

and the beautiful frock-coat was hurled violently against a marble

pillar for its pains.

Just as the seventh regiment was disappearing

to join in the sack and loot, a young

and pretty girl drove up in a hansom, threw

the driver a shilling (which the driver contemplated

with a scorn too deep for words),

and joined the tail of the regiment.
'I knew I should do it,' she said to herself,

'and Alb said I shouldn't.'
In another moment Hugo's was a raging

sea of petticoats. In half an hour the doors

had to be shut and locked, and new crowds

formed on the tessellated pavements; Hugo's

was full.
Hugo's was full!
For three days past Hugo had bought whole

pages of every daily paper in London, in

order to break gently to the public the tremendous

fact that his annual sale would commence

on New Year's Day, and the still more

tremendous fact that it would close on the

third of January. There are only three

genuine annual sales in the Metropolis. One

is Hugo's, another happens in Tottenham

Court Road, and the third—but why disclose

the situation of the third, since all persons

from Putney to Peckham Rise who are worthy

to know it, know it? Hugo's was naturally

the greatest, the largest, the most exciting,

the most marvellous, the most powerful in its

appeal to the most powerful of human instincts—the

instinct to get half a crown's

worth of value for two shillings. In earlier

years Hugo had made his annual sale prodigious

and incredible, with no thought of

profit, merely for the pleasure of the affair.

But he found that the more he offered to the

public the more he received from them, and

that it was practically impossible to lose

money by giving things away. This is, of

course, a fundamental axiom of commerce.

And now Hugo's annual sale was to be more

astonishing than ever; some said that he

meant at any cost to efface the memory of

those discreditable incidents before mentioned.

Decidedly, many of the advertised

bargains were remarkable in the highest

degree. There was, for example, the 'fine

silvered fox-stole, with real brush at each

end,' at a guinea. Every woman who can

tell a silvered fox-stole from a cock's-feather

boa is aware that a silvered fox-stole simply

cannot be sold for a guinea. Yet Hugo had

announced that he would sell two thousand

of them at that price, not to mention muffs

to match at the same figure. And there was

the famous 'Incroyable' corset, white coutille,

with wide belted band round hips, double belt

to buckle at sides, cut low—' Enough!

Further indiscretions of description are not

necessary to show that eighteen and nine is

the lowest price at which a reasonable creature

could hope to obtain the 'Incroyable' corset.

But Hugo's price was twelve and eleven. And

the whole-page advertisements were a solid

blazing mass of such jewels.
The young and pretty girl who had known

that she would 'do it' hastened with assured

steps, and as quickly as the jostling multitudes

would allow, to the fur department.

She was in pursuit of one of the silvered fox-stoles

with real brush at each end. She had

her husband's permission—nay, his command—to

purchase a silvered fox-stole at a guinea—if

she could. On the way to her goal she

encountered by chance Simon Shawn, and it

occurred that a temporary block compelled

her to halt before him. The two gazed at

each other, and Simon looked away, flushing.

It was plain that, though acquainted, they

were not on speaking terms. The fact was,

that their silence covered a domestic drama—a

drama which had arisen as the consequence

of a great human truth—namely, that

even detectives will marry.
It will be remembered that on a certain

morning in July, after Hugo had finished

pasting a notice on a mirror in one of the

common rooms, in the presence of a pink-aproned

waitress, Albert Shawn entered, and

kissed the pink-aproned waitress. So far as

possible, whom Albert Shawn kissed he

married, and he had married the waitress

just the week before Christmas, and this was

she. Simon had objected sternly to the

mésalliance. It seemed shocking to Simon

that a rising detective should marry a girl

who waited on shop-girls. Hence the drama.

Hugo had positively refused to allow an open

quarrel between the brothers, because of its

inconvenience to himself, but he could not

prevent a quarrel between Simon and Lily—such

was her name. They met now for the

first time since the marriage, and Lily's

demeanour may be imagined. She gazed

through Simon as though he did not exist,

and passed magnificently onwards as soon as

the throng permitted. She was Mrs. Albert

Shawn, as neat as ninepence, as smart and

pert as a French maid out for the day. She

drove in hansoms, and she had a five-pound

note in her pocket.
Albert had been granted two weeks' vacation

for his honeymoon, and he ought to have

resumed his duties of detection that morning.

The honeymoon, however, had lasted only

nine days, and the remaining five days of the

period had been spent by him in some secret

affair of his own, an affair which had ended

in an accident to his left foot, so that he

could not walk. The consequence was that,

on this day of all days, Hugo's was deprived

of his services. Lily was, perhaps, not altogether

sorry for the catastrophe which kept

him a prisoner in the nest-like home in Radipole

Road, for it had resulted in this excursion

of hers to the sale. Albert had bidden

her to go to buy a stole and other things, to

keep her eyes open, and to report to Hugo

in person if she observed anything queer.

He had even given her a pass which would

ensure her immediate admittance to any of

Hugo's private lairs. Therefore, Lily felt

extremely important, extremely like a detective's

wife. She knew that Albert trusted

her, and she was very proud that she had not

asked him any questions concerning a matter

exasperatingly mysterious. Albert had taught

her that a detective's wife should crucify

curiosity.
She fought her way to a counter in the fur

department.
'The guinea stoles?' she inquired from a

shopwalker.
'I—I beg pardon, miss,' said the shopwalker.
'Madam,' Lily corrected him. 'I want

one of those silvered fox-stoles advertised

at a guinea.'
'You'll probably find them over there,

madam,' said the shopwalker, pointing.
'Aren't you sure?' she asked tartly. 'I

don't want to struggle across there and then

find they're somewhere else.'
The shopwalker turned his back on her.
'Well, I never!' she exclaimed to herself,

and decided that Albert should avenge her.
Then, behind the counter, she saw a girl

whom she used to serve with a glass of milk

every morning.
'Oh, Miss Lawton,' she cried, as an equal

to an equal, 'can you tell me where the stoles

are to be found?'
'Probably over there, Mrs. Shawn,' said

Miss Lawton kindly, nodding the greeting

she had no time to utter.
So Lily got away from the counter, plunged

into a chartless sea of customers, and eventually

emerged in the quarter which had been

indicated.
'All sold out, miss!'
Such was the blunt answer to her demand

for a silvered fox-stole.
'Don't talk to me like that!' said Mrs.

Albert Shawn. 'It isn't above half-past nine

on the first morning of the sale, and you

advertised two thousand of them.'
'Sorry, miss. All sold out,' repeated the

second shopwalker.
'I shall report this to Mr. Hugo. Do you

know who I am? I'm—'
And the second shopwalker also turned his

back.
Could these things be happening at Hugo's,

at Hugo's, so famous for the courtesy, the

long patience, the indestructible politeness of

its well-paid employés? And could Hugo

have descended to the trickeries of the eleven-pence-halfpenny

draper, who proclaimed non-existent

bargains to lure the unwary into his

shop? Lily might have wondered if she was

not dreaming, but she was far too practical

ever to be in the least doubt as to whether

she was asleep or awake. And now she perceived

that scores of angry women about her

were equally disappointed by the disgraceful

absence of those stoles. The department,

misty, stuffy, and noisy, had the air of being

the scene of an insurrection. One lady was

informing the public generally that she had

demanded a guinea stole at three minutes

past nine, and had been put off with a monstrous

excuse. And then a newspaper reporter

appeared, and began to take notes.

The din increased, though shopwalkers said

less and less, and the chances seemed in

favour of the insurrection becoming a riot.

Other admirable bargains in furs were indubitably

to be had—muffs, for example—and

the cashiers were busy; but nothing

could atone for the famine of stoles.
Lily had a suspicion that Albert would have

wished her to report these singular circumstances

to Hugo at once. But she dismissed

the suspicion, because she passionately desired

an 'Incroyable' corset at twelve and

eleven, and she feared lest the corsets might

have vanished as strangely as the stoles. In

ten minutes, breathless, she had reached the

corset department, demanded an 'Incroyable'

of the correct size, and bought it. There was

no dissatisfaction in the corset department.
'Shall we send it, miss?'
'Madam,' said Lily proudly. 'No, I'll

take it.'
'Yes, madam.'
At the cash desk (No. 56) she had to wait

her turn in a disorderly queue before she

could tender the bill and her five-pound note.

Customers pressed round her on all sides as

she put down the note and peered through

the wire network into the interior of the desk.
'Next, please,' said the cashier sharply,

after a moment.
'My change,' demanded Lily.
'You have had it, madam.'
'Oh,' said Lily, 'I have had it, have I?

Now, none of your nonsense, young man!

Do you know who I am? I'm Mrs. Albert

Shawn.'
'Mr. Randall,' the cashier called out coldly,

and a grave and gigantic shopwalker appeared

who knew not the name of Albert Shawn, and

who firmly told Mrs. Shawn that if she wished

to make a complaint she must make it at the

Central Inquiry Office, ground-floor, Department

1A.
Lily had been brazenly robbed at Hugo's by

an employé of Hugo! She was elbowed

away by other women apparently anxious to

be robbed. She wanted to cry, but suddenly

remembering her identity, and her pass to the

presence of Hugo, she threw up her head and

marched off through the crowds.
She had not proceeded twenty yards before

she was stopped by a group of persons round

a policeman—a policeman obviously called in

from Sloane Street. A stout woman of lady-like

appearance had been arrested on a charge

of attempted pocket-picking. An accusatory

shopwalker charged her, and she replied

warmly that she was Lady Brice (née Kentucky-Webster),

the American wife of the

well-known philanthropist, and that her carriage

was waiting outside. The policeman

and the shopwalker smiled. It was so easy

to be the wife of a well-known philanthropist,

and in these days all the best pickpockets had

their carriages waiting outside.
'I know this lady by sight,' said Lily.

'She visited the common-rooms last year to

see the arrangements, with Mr. Hugo, and he

called her Lady Brice, and I can tell you he'll

be very angry with you.'
'And who are you, my young friend?'

said the policeman sceptically, and threateningly.
'I'm—'
The formula proved useless. Lady Brice

(née Kentucky-Webster) was led off in all her

vast speechless, outraged impeccability, and

poor little Lily was glad to escape with her

freedom and the memory of Lady Brice's

grateful bow.
She ran, gliding in and out between the

knots of visitors, until she was stopped by a

pair of doors being suddenly shut and fastened

in her face. The reason for the obstruction

was plain. Those doors admitted to the

blouse department, and the blouse department,

as Lily could see through the diamond

panes, was a surging sea of bargain-hunters,

amid which shopwalkers stood up like light-houses,

while the girls behind the counters

trembled in fear of being washed away. Discipline,

order, management, had ceased to

exist at Hugo's.
Mrs. Shawn turned to seek another route,

but already dozens of women were upon her,

and she could not retire. The crowd of candidates

for admission to the blouse department

swelled till it filled the gallery between

that department and its neighbour. Then

someone cried out for air, and someone else

protested that the doors at the other end of

the short gallery had also been shut. Lily,

whose manifold misfortunes had not quenched

her interest in the 'Incroyable' corset,

opened her parcel, and found that the corset

was not an 'Incroyable' at all, but an inferior

substitute, with no proper belted band, and

of a shape to startle even a Brighton bathing-woman!

The change must have been effected

by the assistant in making up the parcel.
'Well!'
She could say no more, and think no more,

than this 'Well!'
And, moreover, the condition of the packed

gallery soon caused her to forget even the final

swindle of the corset. The air had rapidly

become exhausted. Women clutched at each

other; women rapped frenziedly against the

heavy, glazed doors; women screamed. It

was the Black Hole of Calcutta over again,

and yet no one in the blouse department

seemed to notice the signals of distress. Lily

felt the perspiration on her brow and chin,

and then she knew that she, too, must scream

and clutch; and she cried out, and the pressure

which forced her against the door grew

more and more terrible.... She had dropped

the corset.... She murmured feebly

'Alb—'.... She began to dream queer

dreams and to see strange lights.... And

then something gave way with a crash, and

she fell forward, and regiments of horses

trampled over her, and at last all living things

receded from her, and she was in the midst of

a great silence. And then even the silence

was gone, and there was nothing.
So ended the first part of Lily's adventures

at Hugo's infamous annual sale.

When she recovered perfect consciousness,

she was in the dome. She knew it was the

dome because Albert had once, at her urgent

request, taken her surreptitiously to see it.

Simon was standing over her, as sympathetic

as the most exigent sister-in-law could wish,

and the great Shawn family feud had expired.
In two minutes she was her intensely practical

self again. In five minutes she had

acquainted Simon with all her experiences;

they were but the complement of what he

himself had witnessed.
The sense of a mysterious calamity over-hanging

Hugo's, and the sense of the shame

which had already disgraced Hugo's, pressed

heavily on both of them. They knew that

only one man could retrieve what had been

lost and avert irreparable disaster. Their

faith in that man was undiminished, and

Simon at least was sure that he had been

victimized by some immense conspiracy.
'Why don't you find Mr. Hugo?' Lily

demanded.
'I've looked everywhere. A letter was

brought up to him about an hour ago, and

he went off instantly.'
'And where's the letter?'
'I expect it's in that drawer, where he

throws all his private letters,' said Simon,

pointing to a drawer in the big writing-table on

the opposite side of the room from the piano.
'Is it locked—the drawer?'
'No.'
'Then open it.'
'It's the governor's private drawer,' said

Simon. 'I've never—'
'Stuff!' Lily exclaimed, and she opened

the drawer and drew out the topmost letter.
It was on blue paper.
'Yes, that's it,' said Simon. 'The envelope

was blue, I remember.'
'He must be in the Safe Deposit,' said Lily,

perusing the letter with flying glance.
And Simon, at length sufficiently emboldened,

seized the letter and read:
'SIR,
'Mr. Polycarp has just been here, and

accidentally left behind him keys of his vault,

including safe of late Mr. Francis Tudor, etc.

In these peculiar circumstances I shall be

glad to know what I am to do.
'Yours respectfully,
'H. BROWN,
'Head Guardian,
'Hugo's Safe Deposit.'
'What on earth can Brown be thinking

about?' muttered Simon. 'Hadn't he got

enough gumption to send a messenger after

Mr. Polycarp, without troubling the governor?

He'll catch it.'
'Never mind that,' said Lily sharply.

'Run down to the Safe Deposit. Run,

Simon.'
It was as though a delay of minutes might

mean ruin. Who could say what was even

then happening in the disorganized and

masterless departments?

CHAPTER XII
SAFE DEPOSIT
The Safe Deposit at Hugo's was perhaps the

most wonderful of all the departments. Until

Hugo thought of it, and paid a trinity of

European experts to design and devise it,

there had existed no such thing as an absolutely

impregnable asylum for valuables. In

Dakota a strong-room alleged to be impregnable

had been approached underground,

tunnelled, mined, and emptied by thieves

with imagination. In the North of England

a safe, which its inventor had defied the whole

universe of crime to open, had been rifled by

the aid of so simple a dodge as duplicate keys.

Even in Tottenham Court Road a couple of

ingenious persons had burnt a hole in a

guaranteed safe by means of common gas

at three and threepence per thousand cubic

feet. These surprises could not occur at

Hugo's. His Safe Deposit really was what

it pretended to be. All contingencies were

provided for. It was the final retort of

virtue to vice.
You approached it by a door of quite ordinary

appearance (no one cares to be seen

leaving what is obviously a safe deposit),

and you signed your name before entering a

lift. You descended forty feet below the

surface of the earth, gave a password on

emerging from the lift, traversed a corridor,

and at length stood in front of the sole entrance

to the Safe Deposit. A guardian,

when you had signed your name again, unlocked

three unpickable, incombustible, and

gunpowder-proof locks in a massive steel

door, and you were admitted, assuming

always that the hour was between nine and

six. Out of hours and on Saturday after-noons

and on Sundays a time-lock rendered

it utterly impossible for any person whatever

to turn any key in the Safe Deposit.

Once the lock was set, Hugo himself could

not have entered, not even to save the British

Empire from instant destruction, until the

time-lock had run its course.
You found yourself in an electrically lighted

world of passages built in flashing steel, with

floors of steel and ceilings of steel—a world

where the temperature was always 65°.

Every passage was separated from every

other passage by steel grilles, and at intervals

uniformed and gigantic officials wandered

about with impassive, haughty faces—faces

that indicated a sublime confidence in the

safety of the multifarious riches committed

to their care. You might have guessed yourself

in the fell grip of the Inquisition. As a

fact, you were in something far more fell.

You were in a vast chamber of steel, and that

chamber was itself enclosed on all sides by

three feet of solid concrete. No thief could

tunnel or mine you without first getting

through the District Railway on the one

hand, or the main drainage system of London

on the other. No thief could rifle you by

means of duplicate keys, for no vault and

no safe could be opened except in the presence

of the head guardian, who possessed

a key without which the renter's key was

useless. No tricks could be played with the

gas, because there was no gas, and the electric

light could only be turned off or on from the

top of the lift-well.
Now, it was a singular thing that when

Simon Shawn, having proved his identity and

his mission at the lift, arrived at the entrance

to the Safe Deposit, he discovered the great

steel door ajar, and no door-guardian in the

leather chair where a door-guardian always

sat. This condition of affairs did not affect

the essential impregnability of any individual

vault or safe, but, nevertheless, it was singular.
Simon walked straight in.
'There's no one at the door,' he said to the

patrol, whom he met in the main passage.

'I want to see Mr. Hugo at once. He's down

here somewhere, or he's been here.'
'Yes, Mr. Shawn,' said the patrol politely;

'I did see Mr. Hugo here about an hour or so

ago. I'll ask Mr. Brown. Will you step into

the waiting-room?'
Half-way along the main corridor was a

large room, whose steel walls were masked by

tapestries, where renters could examine their

treasures on marble tables. It was empty

when Simon went in. The patrol carefully

closed the door on him, and then in a moment

came back to say that Mr. Brown was not in

his office, and had probably gone out to lunch,

the hour being noon.
'Where did you see Mr. Hugo?' Simon

asked, hurrying out of the room in a state of

considerable agitation.
'I saw him just here, sir,' said the patrol,

turning down a short side corridor—the grille

was unfastened—and stopping before a door

numbered thirty-nine. 'He was talking to

Mr. Brown, and the door of the vault was

open.'
'That must be Mr. Polycarp's vault,'

Simon observed; and then he started, and

put his ear against the door. 'Listen!' he

exclaimed to the patrol. 'Can't you hear

anything inside?'
And the patrol also put his ear to the steel

face of the door.
'I seem to hear a faint knocking, but it's

that faint as you scarcely can hear it. There!

it's stopped.'
'He is inside,' Shawn whispered.
'Who's inside?'
'Mr. Hugo.'
'It's God help him, then,' said the patrol,

'if he's there long. There's no ventilation,

Mr. Shawn. We'd better telephone for Mr.

Polycarp. The other key will be in the key-safe.

I can get it. But how do you make

out, sir, that Mr. Hugo can be in there? The

vault could only be locked by Mr. Polycarp

and Mr. Brown together, and surely they

couldn't both—'
'Mr. Polycarp left his keys behind by accident.

He had gone before Mr. Hugo came

down.'
'There's been no Mr. Polycarp here this

morning,' said the patrol a minute later.

'I've looked at the signature-book. I thought

it was queer I hadn't seen him. And, what's

more, that isn't Mr. Polycarp's vault at all.

Mr. Polycarp's vault is No. 37. This vault

has been empty for several weeks.'
'Then you have both the keys?' Simon

demanded quickly.
'No, sir. It's very strange. There's only

one key of No. 39 in the key-safe, and it's the

renter's key.'
'Then Mr. Brown must have the other.'
'I expect so. But he ought not to have.

It's against rules,' said the patrol. 'I know

where he takes his lunch. I'll send for

him.'
Simon put his ear again to the face of the

door. The faint knocking had ceased, but

after a few seconds it recommenced.
'And suppose you don't find Mr. Brown?'

he queried, still listening.
'Then that vault can't be opened. But

never you fear, Mr. Shawn. I'll have him

here in three minutes. It's funny as he

should have left anybody in there by accident—and

Mr. Hugo of all people in this blessed

world....'
The patrol's accents died away as he passed

down the main corridor.
Within the next half-hour Simon, who had

the rare virtue of being honest with himself,

was freely admitting, in the privacy of his

own mind, that the crisis had got beyond his

power to grapple with it, and he had begun

to fear complications more dreadful than he

dared to put into words. For the patrol had

failed to find Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown, head

guardian of the Safe Deposit, had disappeared.

Nor was this all. A renter had come to take

his belongings from a safe in the third side-passage

on the left, and the sub-guardian imprisoned

in that passage could not open the

grille between it and the main corridor. He

had his key, but the key would not turn in

the glittering lock. The renter, too impatient

to wait, had departed very angrily at this

excess of safety. Then it was gradually discovered

that every sub-guardian in every

side-passage was similarly imprisoned. Not

a key in the entire place would turn. The

patrol rushed to the main door. The three

keys had clearly been turned while the door

was opened, and the shot bolts prevented the

door from closing. This explained why the

door was ajar, but it did not explain the

absence of the doorkeeper, who had apparently

followed in the footsteps of his chief,

Mr. Brown.
'The time-lock! Someone must have set

it!' cried the patrol to Shawn, and the two

hastened to the other end of the main corridor,

where the dial of the machine glistened under

an electric lamp.
And all the sub-guardians stirred and

grumbled in their beautiful bright cages like

wrathful lions. No such scene had ever been

known in that Safe Deposit or any other safe

deposit before.
The patrol was right. The dial of the time-lock

showed that it had been set against every

lock, great and small, in the Safe Deposit,

until nine a.m. the next day.
'It's all up!' the patrol said solemnly.
'Do you mean to say nothing can be done

to open that vault till nine to-morrow?'

Simon demanded in despair.
'Nothing. The blooming Czar couldn't

manage it with all his Cossacks! No, nor

Bobs either! This is a Safe Deposit, this is,

and if Mr. Hugo is in that vault, it's Mr. Hugo

as knows it's a Safe Deposit by now.'
A brief silence ensued, and then Simon

said:
'We must telephone to the police. There's

a telephone in the waiting-room, isn't there?'
The patrol admitted that there was, but

his manner hinted a low opinion of the utility

of the police. He stood mute while Simon

Shawn told the telephone receiver what had

occurred in the bowels of the earth beneath

Hugo's.
'Wait a minute,' said the telephone, and

then, after a pause: 'Are you there? I'm

Inspector Winter.'
'That's him as has charge of all the strong-room

cases,' the patrol interjected to Simon.
'I've got Mr. Jack Galpin here, as it

happens,' said the telephone.
'Mr. Jack Galpin?' Simon questioned.
'He's just done eighteen months for an

attempt in Lombard Street,' the patrol explained.

'I've heard of him.'
'I'll come down with him immediately in

a cab,' said the telephone.
When Simon returned to the impregnable

door of Vault 39 he listened in vain for a

sound. Then he knocked with his pen-knife

on the polished steel, and presently there was

an answering signal from within—a series of

scarcely perceptible irregular taps. It struck

him that the irregularity of the taps formed a

rhythm, and after a few seconds he recognised

the rhythm of the Intermezzo from

'Cavalleria Rusticana,' which he had played

for Hugo that very morning.
It was at this moment that the messenger-boy

attached to the department came whistling

into the steel corridors, and delivered to the

patrol a small white packet, which, he said,

Mr. Brown had handed to him with instructions

to hand it to the patrol. He had seen

Mr. Brown in a cab outside the building, and

Mr. Brown had the appearance of being very

ill.
The packet contained the second key of

Vault 39.
'But this'll be no use till to-morrow,' was

the patrol's comment, 'and by then—'

CHAPTER XIII
MR. GALPIN
When the patrol and Simon between them

had explained the mysterious and fatal situation

to Mr. Jack Galpin, Mr. Jack Galpin

leaned against one of the marble tables in

the waiting-room, and roared with laughter.
'Well,' observed Mr. Galpin, 'he didn't

have his Safe Deposit built for nothing, anyhow!'
And he laughed again.
'But he's slowly dying in there!' said

Simon.
'Yes, I know,' said Mr. Galpin. 'That's

what makes it such a good joke.'
'I don't see it, sir,' Simon remarked.
'Simply because your sense of humour is a

bit off. What are you?'
'I am Mr. Hugo's man.'
'My respects.'
Mr. Galpin had arrived with Inspector

Winter, and Inspector Winter had introduced

him as knowing more about safes

than any other man in England, or perhaps

in Europe. After the introduction, Inspector

Winter, being pressed for time, had departed.

Mr. Galpin was aged about forty, and looked

like an extremely successful commercial

traveller. No one would have suspected

that he had recently done eighteen months

anywhere but in a first-class hotel; even his

thin hands were white, and if his hair was

a little short—well, the hair of very many

respectable persons is often a little short.

It appeared that he was under obligations

to Inspector Winter, and anxious to oblige.

The relations between distinguished law-breakers

and distinguished detectives are

frequently such as can only exist between

artists who esteem each other. For the rest,

Mr. Galpin had brought a brown bag.
'You see, the time-lock is placed so

that—' began the patrol.
'Shut up!' said Mr. Galpin curtly. 'I

know all that. I've got scale-plans of every

Safe Deposit in London, and I decided long

since that this one was too good to try. Of

course, with the aid of the entire staff things

might be a bit easier, but not much—not

much!' he repeated scornfully. 'If I can

manage a job at all, I can usually manage it

alone, and in spite of the entire staff.'
'I suppose you couldn't burn the door of the

vault with oxy-hydrogen?' Simon suggested.
'Yes, I could,' said Mr. Galpin; 'and with

the brand of steel used here I should get

through about this time to-morrow. I could

blow the bally vault up with gun-cotton in

something under two seconds, but no doubt

your Mr. Hugo would go up with it, and then

the Yard would be angry. No!'
He hummed an air, and strolled out into

the main corridor to stare at the curious dial

of the time-lock.
'Why not blow up the clock of the time-lock?'

ventured the patrol.
'Look here!' said Mr. Galpin, 'you ought

to know better than that, even if this other

gent doesn't. Any violence to the clock

automatically jams all the connecting levers.

Stop the clock, and it's all up. Nothing but

unbuilding the whole place would free the

locks after that. And it would be a mighty

smart firm that could unbuild this place

inside a fortnight. No!' he said again. 'No

gammon with the clock—unless we could

make it go quicker.'
'Then there's nothing,' Simon stammered.
Mr. Galpin gazed at the young man.
'Assuming I do the job, what's the job

worth?' he asked.
'It's worth anything.'
'Is it worth a hundred pounds?'
'Yes.'
'Cash?'
'Yes, I promise it. I will hand you my

savings-bank book if you like.'
'I only ask because I have a sort of a

notion about that clock. It's a pendulum

clock, and you know how fast a clock ticks

when you take the pendulum away, and the

escapement can run free. It does an hour in

about three minutes. Now, if I could get

the pendulum out without alarming the

clock ... it would be nine to-morrow morning

in no time. See?'
'I see that,' said the patrol. 'I see that.

But what I don't see—'
'Never mind what you don't see,' Mr. Jack

Galpin murmured. 'Bring me my bag out

of there. I may tell you,' he went on to

Simon, 'that I thought of this scheme months

ago, just as a pleasant sort of a fancy, but

quite practical. It's a queer world, isn't it?'
'Here's your bag,' said the patrol.
'Now you two can just go into the waiting-room,

and wait till I call you. Understand?

And tell all these wild beasts round here to

hold their tongues and sit tight. I haven't

got to be disturbed in a job like this....

And it's a hundred pounds if I do it, mister,

no more and no less, eh?'
Within exactly twenty-five minutes Mr.

Galpin entered the waiting-room.
'See that?' he said, holding up a pendulum.

'That's it. You can come and look now.

But I don't invite the public to see my own

private melting process. Not me!'
He had burnt two holes through the half-inch

plate of Bessemer steel in which the

clock was enclosed, and by means of two

pairs of tweezers (which must certainly have

been imitated from the armoury of a dentist)

he had detached the pendulum without

stopping the clock. The hands of the clock

could be plainly seen to move, and its ticking

was furiously rapid.
Mr. Galpin made a calculation on his

dazzling cuff.
'In three-quarters of an hour the clock

will have run out,' he informed his audience,

'and you will be able to open any locks that

you've got keys for. I shall call to-morrow

morning, young man, for the swag. And

don't you forget that there's only one Jack

Galpin in the world. My address is 205, the

Waterloo Road.'
He left, with his bag.
Simon rushed to Vault 39 to encourage the

captive by continual knocking.
Then the messenger-boy, who had been

despatched to obtain food for the prisoners

behind the various grilles, came back with

the desired food, and with a copy of the

Evening Herald. The back page of the

Herald bore Hugo's immense advertisement.

The front page was also chiefly devoted to

Hugo. It displayed headings such as:

'Shocking Scenes at a Sloane Street Sale,'

'Women Injured,' 'Customers Complain of

Wholesale Swindling,' 'Scandalous Mismanagement,'

'The Hugo Safe Deposit Suddenly

Closed,' 'Reported Disappearance of Mr.

Hugo,' 'Is He a Lunatic?'
And when the three-quarters of an hour

had expired Simon and the patrol unlocked

the massive portal of Vault 39, and swung

it open, fearful of what they might see within.

And Hugo, pale and feeble, but alive, staggered

heavily forward, and put a hand on

Simon's shoulder.
'Let us get away from this,' he whispered,

as if in profound mental agony.
Ignoring everything, he passed out of the

impregnable Safe Deposit, with its flashing

steel walls, on Simon's obedient arm.

CHAPTER XIV
TEA
Arrived on the ground-floor, Simon managed

to avoid the busy parts of the establishment,

but he happened to choose a way to Hugo's

private lift which led past the service-door

of the Hugo Grand Central Restaurant.

And Hugo, although apparently in a sort

of torpor, noticed it.
'Tea!' he ejaculated. 'If I could have

some at once!'
And he directed Simon into the restaurant,

and so came plump upon one of the worst

scenes in the entire place. The first day of

the great annual sale was closing in almost a

riot, and there in the restaurant the primeval

and savage instincts of the vast, angry crowd

were naturally to be seen in their crudest

form. The famous walnut buffet, eighty feet

in length, was besieged by an army of customers,

chiefly women, who were competing

for food in a manner which ignored even the

rudiments of politeness. It would be difficult

to deny that several scores of well-dressed

ladies, robbed of their self-possession

and their lunch by delays and vexations and

impositions in the departments, were actually

fighting for food. The girls behind the buffet

remained nobly at their posts, but the situation

had outgrown their experience. Every

now and then a crash of crockery or crystal

was heard over the din of shrill voices, and

occasionally a loud protest. Away from the

buffet, on the fine floor of the restaurant, a

few waitresses hurried distracted and aimless

between the tables at which sat irate and

scandalized persons who firmly believed themselves

to be dying of hunger. A number of

people were most obviously stealing food, not

merely from the sideboards, but from their

fellows. At a table near to the corner in

which Hugo, shocked by the spectacle, had

fallen limp into a chair, was seated an old,

fierce man, who looked like a retired Indian

judge, and who had somehow secured a cup

of tea all to himself. A pretty young woman

approached him, and deliberately snatched

the cup from under his very nose—and without

spilling a drop. The Indian judge sprang

up, roared 'Hussy!' and knocked the table

over with a prodigious racket, then proceeded

to pick the table up again.
'Is it like this everywhere?' asked Hugo

of Shawn.
And Shawn nodded.
'I might have foreseen,' Hugo murmured.
'I'll try to get you some tea, sir,' Shawn

said, with an attempt to be cheerful.
'Don't leave me,' begged Hugo, like a sick

child. 'Don't leave me.'
'Only for a moment, sir,' said Shawn, departing.
Hugo felt that he was about to swoon, that

he had suffered just as much as a man could

suffer, and that Fate was dropping the last

straw on the camel's back. His head fell

forward. He was beaten for that day by

too many mysteries and too many tortures.

And then he observed that the pretty young

woman who had stolen the cup of tea from

the Indian judge was hastening towards him

with the cup of tea in one hand and several

pieces of bread-and-butter in the other.
'Drink this, Mr. Hugo,' she whispered,

standing over him. He hesitated. 'Drink

it, I say, or must I throw it over you?'
He sipped, and sipped again, obediently.
'Good, isn't it?' she questioned.
He looked up at her. He was stronger

already.
'It's very good,' he said, with conviction.

'Now a bit of bread-and-butter. Thanks.'

Yes, the excellence and power of the Hugo

tea was not to be denied, and he was deeply

glad in that moment that he owned his

private plantations in Ceylon. 'Who are

you, may I ask?' he demanded of his rescuer.
'If you please, sir, I'm Albert's wife.'
'Albert?'
'Albert Shawn, your detective, sir.'
'Of course you are!'
'You gave us a bedroom suite for a wedding

present, sir.'
'Of course I did! By the way, where's

Albert?'
'He's had an accident to his foot, and

couldn't come to-day. You're less pale than

you were, sir. Take this other piece.'
Then Simon returned, empty-handed, and

Lily's eye indicated to him her real opinion

of the value of a male in a crisis. She asked

no questions concerning the events which had

ended in Hugo's collapse. She merely dealt

with the collapse, and in the intervals of

dealing with it she explained to Simon how

she had waited and waited in the dome, and

then descended and tried in vain to enter the

Safe Deposit, and been insulted by the messenger-boy,

and had finally drifted to the

restaurant, where she had caught sight of

Hugo and himself, and guessed immediately

that something in the highest degree unusual

had occurred.
'Come,' said Hugo at last, in curt command,

'I am better.'
He had recovered. He was Hugo again.

And Simon was once more nothing but his body

servant, and Lily nothing but an ex-waitress

who had married rather well. He thanked

Lily, and told her to go and look after her

husband as well as she had looked after him.
In the dome Simon ventured to show him

the Evening Herald. And, having read it,

Hugo nodded his head and pressed his lips

together. He had ordered champagne and

sandwiches, and was consuming them, at the

same time opening a series of yellow envelopes

which lay on a table. These latter were

reports from his detective corps, which had

accumulated during the day.
'Get a sheet of plain paper,' he said to

Simon, 'and write this letter. Are you

ready? Yes, it will do in pencil; I even

prefer it in pencil.
'"DEAR SIR,
'"I have reason to think that you

may be interested in some extraordinary

information which I have in my possession

concerning Camilla Tudor, who is supposed

to have been buried at Brompton Cemetery

in July last year. If I am right, perhaps you

will accompany the bearer to my rooms. At

present I will not disclose my name.
'"Yours, etc."
'Put any initials you like. Address it to

Louis Ravengar, Esquire. Now listen to me.

Go down to the auto garage, and choose a

good man to take the note instantly; a second

man must go with him. If they bring back

Ravengar, he is to be taken to No. 6, Blair

Street, shown upstairs, and brought along the

bridge-passage into the building. It will be

quite dark, and he will never guess. If necessary,

he must be brought to me by force,

once he is inside. Have two or three porters

in attendance to see to that. But if it's

managed properly, he'll come without a suspicion,

and he'll be finely surprised when he

finds that the long passage ends in just this

room. Come back to me as soon as you've

attended to that.'
'Yes, sir,' said Simon, quite mystified, but

none the less enchanted to see Hugo so

actively the old Hugo.
In ten minutes he had returned, and was

beginning to relate new facts which he had

learnt while downstairs.
'Stop!' said Hugo. 'Don't worry me with

needless details. I know enough. And don't

ask me any questions. We can't hope to

remedy the state of affairs to-day. Nevertheless,

we can do something for to-morrow.

I must have Mr. Bentley, the drapery manager,

brought here before six o'clock. He must be

found.'
'He is found, sir. He has shot himself in

his house in Pimlico Road.'
Hugo started.
'Ah!' was all he said at first. He added

dryly: 'Good! And Brown?'
'I have no news of him, sir. He's vanished.'
'Telephone down to the press department

that Mr. Aked must come up to see me at

seven o'clock precisely, and, in the meantime,

he must secure an extra half-page in all

to-morrow's papers.'
'Yes, sir.'
'And after closing-time the entire staff

must assemble, the men in the carpet-rooms,

and the women in the central restaurant—or

what's left of it. I shall speak to them.

Have notices put in the common-rooms.'
'Yes, sir.'
'And send me all the buyers from the

drapery department. They must go round

and buy every silvered fox-stole in London

to-night, at no matter what price.'
'Certainly, sir.'
'And telephone to Y.Z. that I shall be

down there as soon as I can about these

things.'
He touched the pile of yellow envelopes.

Y.Z. was the name always given to the

detectives' private room.
'Precisely, sir.'
'That's all.'
Simon Shawn gathered that his master had

a very definite clue to the origin of the unique

and fatal events of that day, and that all

dark places were about to be made light

with a blinding light.

CHAPTER XV
RAVENGAR IN CAPTIVITY
'Ravengar, what a fool you are!'
The dome was in darkness. Hugo, who

stood concealed near the switch, turned on

all the lights as soon as he had uttered this

singular greeting, and stepped forward. He

had decided to kill Ravengar. The desire to

murder was in his heart, and in order to give

all his instincts full play he had chosen a

theatrical method of welcoming his victim

into the fastness from which he was never

to escape.
'D—n!' exclaimed Ravengar, evidently

astounded to the uttermost to find himself in

Hugo's dome, and in the presence of Hugo.
He sprang back to the door of the dressing-room

by which he had so unsuspectingly

entered.
'What a fool you are to fall into a trap so

simple! No; don't try to get away. You

can't. That door is locked now. And, moreover,

I have a revolver here, and also a pair

of handcuffs, which I shall use if I have any

trouble with you.'
Ravengar gazed at his captor, irresolute.

His clean-shaven upper lip seemed longer

than ever, and his short gray beard and gray

locks gave him an appearance of sanctimony

which not even his sinister eyes could destroy.

Then he sat down on a chair.
'I should like to know—' he began,

trying to speak steadily.
'You would like to know,' Hugo took him

up, 'why I am here alive, instead of being

in that vault, suffocated. It was a pretty

dodge of yours to get me down there. You

counted on my curiosity about the Tudor

mystery. You felt sure I should yield to

the temptation. And I did yield. You were

right. I was prepared to commit a breach

of faith in order to satisfy that curiosity.

No sooner was the door closed on me by that

scoundrel Brown, and I found the vault not

Polycarp's vault at all, than I knew to a

certainty that you were at the bottom of the

affair. So easy to make out afterwards that

it was an accident! So easy to spirit Brown

away! So easy to explain everything! Why,

Ravengar, you intended to murder me! I

saw the whole scheme in a flash. You have

corrupted many of my servants to-day. But

you didn't corrupt all of them. And because

you didn't, because you couldn't, I am alive.

You would like to know how I got out. But

you will never know, Ravengar. You will

die without knowing.'
Ravengar put his hands in his pockets.
'I can only assume that you are going

mad, Owen,' said he. 'I have long guessed

that you were. Nothing else will explain

this extraordinary action of yours towards

me.'
'You act well,' replied Hugo, sitting down

and eyeing Ravengar critically. 'You act

well. But you gave the whole show away by

the tone in which you swore two minutes ago.

If there is anyone mad in this room, it is yourself.

Your schemes show that queer mixture

of amazing ingenuity and amazing folly which

is characteristic of madmen. Let us hope you

are mad, at any rate.'
'My schemes!' sneered Ravengar. 'You

might at least tell the madman what his

schemes are.'
Hugo laughed.
'You must have been maturing the day's

business quite a long time, my boyhood's

companion, my floater of public companies,

my pearl of financiers. Yes, decidedly parts

of it were wonderfully ingenious. To sow

the place with pickpockets, to get at my

cashiers, my commissionaires, and my servers.

To substitute your own false shopwalkers for

the genuine article. To arrange for the arrest

of important customers on preposterous

charges of theft. To lock up a hundred

women in a gallery till they nearly died.

To have my best and most advertised bargains

removed in the night. To deprive the

restaurants of food, and to employ women

to turn them upside down. To produce, as

you contrived to do, a general air of pandemonium,

and to ruin the discipline of over

three thousand of the best-trained employés

in England. All this, and much else which

I do not mention, was devilish clever in its

conception, and the execution of it commands

my unqualified admiration. Especially having

regard to the fact that you contrived not to

arouse my suspicions. I may tell you that

certain strange incidents which occurred in

my establishment during the autumn did

indeed lead me vaguely to suspect that you

were at work against me, but you were sufficiently

smart to put me off the track again.

Let me add that until this afternoon I did

not perceive that your purchase of a controlling

share in the Evening Herald was only

a portion of a mightier plan.'
'Really, Owen—'
'Don't waste your breath in denials. You

will have none at all presently, like Bentley.'
'Bentley?' repeated Ravengar, with a slight

movement.
'Yes; but we will come to Bentley in a few

minutes. I have enlarged to you on your own

cleverness. I must enlarge to you on your

folly. What folly! What was the end of all

this to be, Ravengar? I have tried to put

myself in your place, and to follow your

thoughts. You hate me. You think I robbed

you of a fortune, and that I helped to rob you

of a woman. You wished to buy my business,

and add it to the roll of your companies.

And I deprived you of that triumph. Your

hatred of me grew and grew. Leading a

solitary and narrow life, you allowed it to

develop into a species of monomania. I had

come out on top once too often for your peace

of mind. In your opinion the world was too

small to hold both of us. Accordingly, you

evolved your terrific campaign. My business

was to be seriously damaged. And I was to

be murdered. And then you were to get the

concern cheap from my executors, and to

float me dead since you could not float me

living. What folly, Ravengar! What stupendous

folly! Even if the fanciful and

grotesque scheme had succeeded as far as

my death, it could not have succeeded beyond

that point.'
'I don't know what you are chattering

about, Owen, but you look as if you expected

me to ask, "Why?" Anything to oblige you.

Why?'
'You would have known the reason had

you lived long enough to read the provisions

of my will,' said Hugo.
'I see,' said Ravengar.
'You do,' said Hugo. 'You see, you hear,

you breathe, but Bentley doesn't. Bentley

has killed himself.' (Ravengar started.) 'So

that if you have not my blood on your conscience,

you have his. You tempted him; he

fell ... and he has repented. Admit that

you tempted him!'
Ravengar smiled superiorly. And then

Hugo sprang forward in a sudden overmastering

passion.
'Hate breeds hate,' he cried, 'and I have

learnt from you how to hate. Admit that

you have tried to ruin and to murder me,

or, by G—! I will kill you sooner than I

intended.'
He had no weapon in his hands; the revolver

was in a drawer; but nevertheless

Ravengar shrank from those menacing hands.
'Look here, Hugo—'
'Will you admit it? Or shall I have to—'
Their wills met in a supreme conflict.
'Oh, very well, then,' muttered Ravengar.
The conflict was over.
Hugo returned to his chair.
'Miserable cur!' he exclaimed. 'You were

afraid of me. I knew I could frighten you.

I would have liked to be able to admire something

more than your ingenuity. Ravengar,

I do believe I could have forgiven your

attempt to murder me if it had not included

an attempt to dishonour me at the same time.

There is something simple and grand about a

straightforward murder—I shall prove to you

soon that I do not always regard murder as a

crime—but to murder a man amid circumstances

of shame, to finish him off while

making him look a fool—that is the act of a—of

a Ravengar.'
Ravengar yawned and glanced at his watch.
'It's nearly my dinner-time,' said he.
Again Hugo sprang forward, and, snatching

at the watch, tore it and the chain from

Ravengar's waistcoat, dashed them to the

floor, and stamped on them. He was amazed,

and he was also delighted, at his own fury.

The lust of destruction had got hold of him.
'Ass!' he murmured, suddenly lowering his

voice. 'Can't you guess what I mean to do?'
'I cannot,' Ravengar stammered.
'I mean to put you to the same test to

which you put me. You arranged that I

should spend twenty-two hours in a vault

without ventilation. At the end of five hours

I was by no means dead. I might have survived

the twenty-two. But, frankly, I don't

fancy I should. And I don't fancy you will.

In fact, I'm convinced that you won't.'
'Indeed!' said Ravengar uncertainly.
'You think this scene is not real,' Hugo

continued. 'You think it can't be real. You

refuse to credit the fact that this time to-morrow

you will be dead. You refuse to

admit to yourself that I am in earnest—deadly,

fatal earnest.'
'Upon my soul!' Ravengar burst out,

standing, 'I believe you are.'
'Good,' said Hugo. 'You are waking up,

positively. You are getting accustomed to

the unpleasant prospect of not dying in your

bed surrounded by inconsolable dependants.'
'Hugo,' Ravengar began persuasively,

'you must be aware that all these suspicions

of yours are a figment of your excited brain.

You must be aware that I never meant to

murder you.'
'My dear fellow,' Hugo replied with calm

bitterness, 'I don't intend to murder you. I

intend merely to put you in that vault. Your

death will be an accidental consequence, as

mine would have been. And why should you

not die? Can you give me a single good

reason why you should continue to live?

What good are you doing on the earth?

Are you making anyone happy? Are you

making yourself happy? That spark of

vitality which constitutes your soul has

chanced on an unfortunate incarnation. Suppose

that I release it, and give it a fresh opportunity,

shall I not be acting worthily? For

you must agree that murder in the strict sense

is an impossible thing. The immortal cannot

die. Vital energy cannot be destroyed. All

that the murderer does is to end one incarnation

and begin another.'
'So that is your theory!'
'Was it not yours, when you got me deposited

in the vault?' Hugo demanded with

ferocious irony. 'I am bound to believe that

it was. The common outcry against murder

(as it is called) can have no weight with enlightened

persons like you and me, Ravengar.'
'Perhaps not,' said Ravengar, summoning

his powers of self-control. 'But the common

outcry against murder is apt to be very inconvenient

for the person who chooses, as you

put it, to end one incarnation and begin

another. Has it not struck you, Owen, that

inquiries would be made for me, that my death

would be certain to be discovered, and that

ultimately you would suffer the penalty?'
'My arrangements for the future are far

more complete than yours could have been in

regard to me,' Hugo answered smoothly.

'You betrayed some clumsiness. I shall

profit by your mistakes. No one will see you

go into the Safe Deposit except myself and a

man whom I can trust. No one at all except

myself will see you go into the vault. I can

manage the operation alone. A little chloroform

will quieten you for a time. The vault

once closed will not be opened during my

lifetime, unless at four o'clock to-morrow

night I hear you knocking on the door. Of

course, inquiries will be made, but they will

be futile. People often simply disappear.

You will simply disappear.'
The clock struck six.
'And your conscience?' Ravengar muttered.
'It's soon well under control. Besides, I

shall be doing the human race, and especially

the investing part of the human race, a very

good turn.'
Then Ravengar approached Hugo, and,

Hugo rising to meet him, their faces almost

touched in the middle of the great room.
'You called me a cur,' he said. 'Yet

perhaps I am not such a cur after all. You

have beaten me. You mean to finish me; I

can see it in your face. Well, you will regret

it more than I shall. Do you know I have

often wished to die? You are right in saying

that there is no reason why I should live. I

am only a curse to the world. But you are

wrong to scorn me when you kill me. You

ought to pity me. Did I choose my temperament,

my individuality? As I am, so I was

born, and from his character no man can

escape.'
And he sat down, and Hugo sat down.
'When is it to be?' Ravengar questioned.
'In a few minutes,' said Hugo impassively,

feeding his mortal resentment on the memory

of those hours when he himself had waited

for death in the vault.
'Then I shall have time to ask you how you

came to know that Camilla Payne, or rather

Camilla Tudor, is alive.'
'She is not alive,' Hugo explained. 'The

suggestion contained in my decoy letter was

a pure invention in order to entice you. As

you tempted me into the vault, so I tempted

you here on your way to the vault.'
'But she is alive all the same!' Ravengar

persisted. 'It is the fact that she is not dead

that makes me less unwilling to die, for a word

from her might send me to a death more

shameful than the one you have so kindly

arranged for me.'
Hugo in that instant admired Ravengar,

and he replied quite gently:
'You are mistaken. Where can you have

got the idea that she is not dead? She is

dead. I myself—I myself screwed her up in

her coffin.'
The words sounded horrible.
'Then you were in the plot!' Ravengar

cried.
'What plot?'
'The plot to persuade me falsely that she

is dead. Bah! I know more than you think.

I know, for example, that her body is not in

the coffin in Brompton Cemetery. And I am

almost sure that I know where she is hiding.

I should have known beyond doubt before

to-morrow morning. However, what does it

matter now?'
'Not in the coffin?' Hugo whispered, as if

to himself. His whole frame trembled, shook,

and his heart, leaping, defied his intellect.

CHAPTER XVI
BURGLARS
When at eleven o'clock that same winter

night Hugo stood hesitating, with certain

tools and a hooded electric lamp in his hand,

on the balcony in front of the drawing-room

window of Francis Tudor's sealed flat, he

thought what a strange, illogical, and capricious

thing is the human heart.
He knew that Camilla was dead. He had

had the very best and most convincing

evidence of the fact. He knew that Ravengar's

suspicions were without foundation,

utterly wrong-headed; and yet those statements

of his enemy had unsettled him. They

had not unsettled the belief of his intelligence,

but they had unsettled his soul's peace. And

that curiosity to learn the whole truth about

the history of the relations between Francis

Tudor and Camilla, that curiosity which had

slumbered for months, and which had been

so suddenly awakened by Ravengar's lure of

the morning, was now urged into a violent

activity.
Nor was this all. Camilla was surely dead.

But supposing that by some incredible chance

she was not dead (lo! the human heart),

could he kill Ravengar? This question had

presented itself to him as he sat in the dome

listening to Ravengar's asseverations that

Camilla lived. And the mere ridiculous,

groundless suspicion that she lived, the mere

fanciful dream that she lived, had quite

changed and softened Hugo's mood. He had

struggled hard to keep his resolution to kill

Ravengar, but it had melted away; he had

fanned the fire of his mortal hatred, but it had

cooled, and at length he had admitted to

himself, angrily, reluctantly, that Ravengar

had escaped the ordeal of the vault. And

this being decided, what could he do with

Ravengar? Retain him under lock and key?

Why? To what end? Such illegal captivities

were not practicable for long in

London. Besides, they were absurd, melodramatic,

and futile. As the moments passed

and the fumes of a murderous intoxication

gradually cleared away, Hugo had regained

his natural, sagacious perspective, and he had

perceived that there was only one thing to do

with Ravengar.
He let Ravengar go. He showed him

politely out.
It was an anti-climax, but the incalculable

and peremptory processes of the heart often

result in an anti-climax.
The night was cold and damp, as the

morning had been, and Hugo shivered, but

not with cold. He shivered in the mere

exciting eagerness of anticipation. He had

chosen the drawing-room window because the

panes were very large. He found it perfectly

simple, by means of the treacled cardboard

which he carried, to force in the pane noiselessly.

He pushed aside the blind, and crept

within the room. So simple was it to violate

the will of a dead man, and the solemnly

affixed seals of his executor! He had arranged

that the pane should be replaced before

dawn, and the new putty darkened to match

the rest. Thus, no trace would remain of the

burglarious entry. No seal on door or window

would have been broken.
He stood upright in the drawing-room,

restored the blind and the heavy curtains to

their positions, and then ventured to press the

button of his lamp. He saw once more the

vast outlines of the room which he had last

seen under such circumstances of woe. The

great pieces of furniture were enveloped in

holland covers, and resembled formless ghosts

in the pale illumination of the lamp. He

shivered again. He was afraid now, with the

fear of the unknown, the forbidden, and the

withheld. Why was he there? What could

he hope to discover?
In answer to these questions, he replied:
'Why did Francis Tudor order that the flat

should be closed? He must have had some

reason. I will find it out. It is essential to

my peace of mind to know. I meant to

commit murder to-day; I have only committed

burglary. I ought to congratulate

myself and sing for joy, instead of feeling

afraid.'
So he reassured his spirit as he stepped carefully

into the midst of the holland-covered

and moveless ghosts. On the mantelpiece to

the left there still stood the electric table-light,

and by its side still lay the screwdriver....

He determined to pass straight through

the drawing-room. At the further edge of

the carpet, on the parquet flooring between the

carpet and the portière leading to the inner

hall, he noticed under the ray of his lamp footprints

in the dust—footprints of a man, and

smaller footprints, either of a woman or a

child. He remained motionless, staring at

them. Then it occurred to him that during

the days between the death of its tenant and

the sealing-up the flat would probably not

have been cleaned, and that these footprints

must have been made months ago by the last

persons to leave the flat. Little dust would

fall after the closing of the flat. He was glad

that he had thought of that explanation. It

was a convincing explanation.
Nevertheless he dared not proceed. For on

the other mantelpiece to the right there was a

clock, and while staring in the ghostly silence

at the footprints, he had fancied that his ear

caught the ticking of the clock. Imagination,

doubtless! But he dared not proceed until

he had satisfied himself that his ears had

deluded him; and, equally, he dared not

approach the clock to satisfy himself. He

could only gaze at the reflection of the clock

in the opposite mirror. In the opposite

mirror the hands indicated half a minute

past nine; hence the clock was really at half

a minute to three, and if it was actually

going, it might be expected to strike immediately.

He waited. He heard a preliminary

grinding noise familiar to students of symptoms

in clocks, and in the fraction of a second

he was bathed from head to foot in a cold

perspiration.
The clock struck three.
The next instant he walked boldly up to

the clock and bent his ear to it. No, he

could hear nothing. It had stopped. He

glared steadily at the hands for two

minutes by his own watch; they did not

move.
In the back of his head, in the small of his

back, in his legs, little tracts of his epidermis

tickled momentarily. He wiped his face, and

walked boldly away from the clock to the

portière, which he lifted with one arm. Then

he threw the light of his lamp direct on the

dial, and glared at it again, fearful lest it

should have taken advantage of his departure

to resume its measuring of eternity.
Could a clock go for four months? A

clock could be made that would go for four

months. But this was not a freak-clock. It

was a large Louis Seize pendule, and he knew

it to be genuine of his own knowledge; he

had bought it.
He dropped the portière between himself

and the clock, and stood in the inner hall.

He had had as much of the drawing-room as

was good for his nerves.
The inner hall was oblong in shape, and

measured about twelve feet at its greatest

width. In front of him, as he stood with his

back to the drawing-room, was a closed door,

which he knew led into the principal bedroom

of the flat. To his right another heavy

portière divided the inner from the outer

hall. This portière hung in straight perpendicular

folds. He wondered why the portières

had not been taken down and folded

away.
He decided to penetrate first into the bedroom,

partly because he deemed the bedroom

might contain the solution of the enigma, and

partly because his eye had fancied it saw a

slight tremor in the portière leading to the

outer hall. So he stepped stoutly across the

space which separated him from the bedroom

door. But he had not reached the door

before there was a loud, sharp explosion, and

a panel of the door splintered and showed

a hole, and he thought he heard a faint

cry.
A revolver shot!
He did not believe in anything so far-fetched

as man-traps and spring-guns. Hence

there must be some person or persons in the

flat. Some unseen intelligence was following

him. Some mysterious will had ordained

that he should not enter that bedroom. The

shot was a warning. He guessed from the

flight of the splinters and the appearance of

the hole that the mysterious will must be on

the other side of the portière, but the portière

gave no sign.
What was he to do? He had brought with

him no weapon. He had not anticipated that

revolvers would be needed in the exploration

of an empty and forbidden flat. The very

definite terrors of the inner hall seemed to

him to surpass the vaguer terrors of the

drawing-room, and he decided to return

thither in order to consider quietly what his

tactics should be; if necessary, he could return

to the dome for arms and assistance. But no

sooner did he move a foot towards the drawing-room

than another shot sounded. The

drawing-room portière trembled, and something

crashed within the apartment. The

mysterious will had ardently decided that he

should go neither back nor forward.
'Who's there? Who's that shooting?'

he muttered thickly, and extinguished his

lamp.
He had meant to cry out loud, but, to

his intense surprise, his throat was dried

up.
There was no answer, no stir, no noise.

The silence that exists between the stars

seemed to close in upon him. Then he really

knew what fear was. He admitted to himself

that he was unmistakably and horribly afraid.

He admitted that life was inconceivably precious,

and the instinct to preserve it the

greatest of all instincts. And gradually he

came to see that the safest course was the

most desperate course, and gradually his

courage triumphed over his fear.
He dropped gently to his hands and knees,

and began, with a thousand precautions, to

crawl like a serpent towards the outer hall.

The darkened lamp he held between his teeth.

If the mysterious will fired again, the mysterious

will would almost to a certainty fire

harmlessly over his head. At last his hands

touched the portière. He hesitated, listened,

and put one hand under the portière. Then,

relighting the lamp, he sprang up with a yell

on the other side of the portière, and clutched

for the unseen intelligence.
But there was nothing. He stood alone in

the outer hall. To his right lay the side-passage

between the drawing-room and the

cabinet de toilette, which Camilla had used on

the night of her engagement. In front of

him was a door, slightly ajar, which led to

the servants' quarters. He gazed around,

breathing heavily.

CHAPTER XVII
POLYCARP AND HAWKE'S MAN
Then it was that he heard a noise, something

between scratching and fumbling, on the

further side of the front-door, in the main

corridor of the flats. He could see through

the ground glass over the door that the

corridor was lighted as usual.
He thought: 'Someone is breaking the

seal on that door!' And his next idea was:

'Since the seal is being broken in the full

light of the public corridor, it is being broken

by someone who has the right to break it.

Only one man has the right, and that man is

Francis Tudor's executor, Senior Polycarp.'
The noise of scratching and fumbling ceased,

and a key was placed in the lock.
Hugo hastily extinguished his lamp, and

hid behind the portière. Immediately the

lamp was extinguished he observed, what he

had not observed before, that a faint light

came through the aperture of the door leading

to the servants' quarters.
The front-door opened, and he heard footsteps

in the hall. Then ensued a pause. Then

the footsteps advanced, and the newcomer

evidently went into the room where the faint

light was.
'Come out of that!'
Yes; it was Polycarp's quiet, mincing,

imperious voice.
'Come out of it yourself!'
The answering tones were gruff, heavy, full,

the speech of a strong coarse-fibred man.
Hugo peeped cautiously through the portière.

Polycarp was backing slowly out of

the room into the hall, followed by a tall,

dark, scowling man, who bore an ordinary

kitchen candle. Polycarp halted in the middle

of the floor. The man also halted; he seemed

to be towering over Polycarp in an attitude

of menace.
'Let me pass,' said the man. 'I've had

enough of this.'
Polycarp smiled scornfully.
'You're caught,' said he. 'You're one of

Hawke's men, aren't you?'
'Go to h—!' was the man's ferocious

reply.
'Answer my question, sir.'
'What if I am?' the man grumbled.
'In five minutes you'll be in the hands of

the police. I got wind yesterday of what

your rascally agency was up to. You needn't

deny anything. You're working on behalf of

Mr. Ravengar. You know me! Mr. Ravengar

happens to be a client of mine, but after

to-night he will be so no longer. What he

wants done in this flat I cannot guess, but it's

an absolute certainty that you're in for three

years' penal, my friend.'
'Let me pass,' the man repeated, lifting his

jaw, 'or I'll blow your brains out!'
He produced his revolver.
'Oh no, you won't,' said Polycarp coldly.

'You daren't. You aren't on the stage, and

you aren't in Texas. And you aren't a bold

Bret Harte villain. You're simply the creature

of a private inquiry agency, as it's called,

the most miserable of trades! Usually you

spend your time in manufacturing divorces,

but just now you're doing something more

dangerous even than that, something that

needed more pluck than you've got. I should

advise you to come with me quietly.'
Polycarp was in evening dress, and carried

a pair of white gloves. Hugo decidedly admired

the old dandy as he stood there gazing

up so condescendingly at the man with the

candle.
'Look here!' said the man with the candle.

'Let me pass. I don't want any fuss. I

want to go. There's more in this flat than

I bargained for. Let me pass.'
'Give me that revolver,' Polycarp smoothly

demanded.
'Curse it!' cried the man. 'I'll give it

you! Hands up, you old fool! Do you

think I'm here for fun?'
And he raised the revolver.
'I shall not put my hands up.'
'I'll count five,' said the man grimly, 'and

if you don't—'
'Count.'
'One!... two!... three! Can't you

see I mean it?'
Hugo perceived plainly the murderous, wild

look on the man's face. He knew what it was

to feel murderous. He knew that in a fit of

homicide all considerations of prudence, all

care for the future, vanish away, that the

mind is utterly monopolized by the obsession

of the one single desire.
Polycarp disdainfully sneered:
'Four!'
Hugo could withstand the strain no more.

He bounded out from his concealment, and

snatched the revolver from the man's hand.
'I forgot you,' growled the man, glancing

at him, disgusted.
And so saying he dashed the candle in

Polycarp's face and knocked him violently

against Hugo. Both Hugo and Polycarp fell

to the ground. The man made a leap for the

door, and in a second had fled, banging it

after him. Hugo and Polycarp rose with stiff

movements. Hugo picked up his lamp, and

the two confronted each other. It was a

highly delicate situation.
'Your life is, at any rate, saved,' said Hugo

at length.
'You think it was in danger?'
Polycarp's lip curled.
'I think so.'
'Possibly you foresaw the danger I ran,'

Polycarp remarked with frigid irony, 'and

came into the flat with the intention of protecting

me. May I ask how you came in?'
'I came in through the drawing-room

window,' said Hugo. 'I did not interfere

with your seals, however,' he added.
'You know you are guilty of a criminal

offence?'
'I know it.'
'And that I, as executor of the late Francis

Tudor, have a duty which I must perform, no

matter how unpleasant both for you and for

me?'
'Just so.'
'What are you doing here? Do you

think your conduct is worthy of a gentleman?'
Hugo put the candle down on a table, and

dug his hands into his pockets.
'At this moment,' said he, 'I am not a

gentleman. I am just a man. Nothing else.

I will appeal to you as another man. I need

hardly say that I have no connection with the

opposition firm; I was entirely ignorant of the

presence of Hawke's mission here when I broke

into the flat. I had no notion that Ravengar

was pursuing investigations similar to mine.

Mr. Polycarp, Ravengar is, or was, a client

of yours—'
'Was.'
'Yes, I heard what you said a few moments

ago. Was a client of yours. I am sure,

therefore, that no one knows better than you

that Ravengar is not an honest man. On the

other hand, I am equally sure that on the few

occasions when you and I have met I must

have impressed you as a comparatively honest

man. Is it not so? I speak without false

modesty. Is it not so?'
Polycarp nodded.
'Well, then,' proceeded Hugo, walking

slowly about, 'you will probably need no

convincing that in any difficulty between me

and Ravengar I am in the right. Now, there

have been, and are, matters between Ravengar

and me in which others had best not

interfere, even indirectly. I shall end those

matters in my own way, because I am the

strongest, and because my hands are clean.

I can give you no details. But let me tell

you that once the whole of my life's dream

was in this flat, this flat which you have

legally closed, and I have illegally opened.

Let me tell you that my life, the only part

of my life for which I cared, came to an end

in this flat some months ago: and that a

mystery hangs over that event which has

lately made intolerable even the dead-alive

existence which Fate had left to me. Let

me tell you that circumstances have arisen

this very day which rendered it impossible

for me to keep myself out of this flat, be the

penalty what it might. And, finally, let me

make my appeal to you.'
'What do you want?' asked Polycarp

quietly. The sincerity of Hugo's emotion

had touched him. 'Don't ask me to act

contrary to my duty.'
'But that is just what I shall ask!' Hugo

exclaimed. 'Leave me. Leave me till to-morrow:

that is my sole wish. What is your

duty, after all? Tudor is dead. He is

beyond the reach of harm. He requires the

protection of no lawyer. Trust me, and leave

me. I am an honest man. Forget your law,

forget your parchments, forget the conventions

of society, forget everything except that

you are human, and can do a service to a

fellow-creature. Exercise some imagination,

and see how artificial and absurd is the world

of ideas in which you live. Listen to your

heart, and help me. I am worth it. Can't

you see how I suffer? To-day I have been

through as much as I can stand. I am at the

end of my forces, and I must have sympathy.

You will be guilty of deliberate neglect of

duty in leaving me here, but I implore you

to leave me. And I give no specific reason

why you should. Will you?'
There was a silence.
'Yes,' said Polycarp.
'I thank you.'
'I don't know why I should consent,' Polycarp

continued, 'but I do. I am quite in the

dark. Legally, I am a disgrace to my profession.

I forfeit my professional honour.

But I will consent. Do what you like. Go

out as you came in and leave no trace. If,

however—'
'Don't trouble to say that,' Hugo interrupted

him. 'I shall take no unfair advantage

of your generosity. The flat and all its

contents are absolutely safe in my hands.

And if you should decide, in the future, that

I must accept the consequences of to-night's

work, I shall not shuffle. All I want is to be

left alone now.'
Polycarp opened the door.
'Good-night,' he said. 'Perhaps you did

save my life. But if you had appealed on

that account to my gratitude I should have

been obliged to refuse your request.'
'I know it,' said Hugo. 'I knew whom I

was talking to. Good-night, and thanks.'
'I shall lock this door,' Polycarp called out,

departing.
'Yes, do; and, I say, you'll lay hands on

that man of Hawke's easily enough in a day

or two.'
'Oh, certainly,' said Polycarp. 'I have

not forgotten him. But I was compelled to

deal with you first.'
Twisting his white moustache, and buttoning

his overcoat across the vast acreage of

his shirt-front, Polycarp disappeared from

Hugo's view into the corridor.

CHAPTER XVIII
HUSBAND AND WIFE
Hugo bolted the front-door on the inside,

relighted the candle which Hawke's man had

used as a weapon, and placed it in the middle

of the hall floor. He then penetrated into

the servants' part of the flat, and emerged

on to the balcony by the small side-door,

which was open, and had evidently been

forced by Hawke's man. And there, on the

balcony, he leaned over the balustrade in the

cold humid night, and tried to recover his

calmness. He felt that any systematic,

scientific search of the premises would be

impossible to him until his mind resembled

somewhat less a sea across which a hurricane

has just passed.
Many questions stood ready to puzzle his

brain, but he ignored them all, and fell into

a vague reverie, of which Camilla was the

centre. And from this reverie he was suddenly

startled by the clear, unmistakable

sound of a door being shut within the flat.

It was not the shutting of a door by the

wind, but the careful, precise shutting of a

door by some person who had a habit of

shutting doors as doors ought to be shut.
'Polycarp has returned!' was his first

thought. But he remembered. 'No! I

bolted the front-door on the inside.'
The conundrum of the clock and of the two

sizes of footprints in the drawing-room recurred

to him. Without allowing himself to

hesitate, he strode back again into the flat,

with a sort of unbreathed sigh, an unuttered

complaint against circumstances for not giving

him an instant's peace.
The candle was still placidly burning in the

hall, but its position had certainly been

shifted by at least three feet. It was much

nearer the portière leading to the inner hall.

Hugo listened intently. Not a sound! And

he stared interrogatively at the candle as

though the candle were a guilty thing.
However, he now possessed the revolver

of Hawke's man, and this gave him confidence.

He left the perambulating candle to

itself, and proceeded to the inner hall by the

light of his own electric lamp. The door of

the principal bedroom, which he had originally

meant to invade, lay to his right; the entrance

to the drawing-room lay to his left. He

thought he would take another look at the

drawing-room, and then he thought:
'No; I'll tackle the bedroom.'
And he seized the handle of the bedroom

door. At the first trial it would not turn,

but in a moment it turned a little, and then

turned back against his pressure.
'Someone's got hold of it inside!' he said

to himself.
He put the lamp on a chair, and took the

revolver from his pocket in readiness for any

complications that might follow his forcing

of the door.
Then he heard a woman's voice within the

bedroom.
'I shall open it, Alb, if you kill me for it.

I don't care who it is. You may be dying

of loss of blood. In fact, I'm sure you are.'
And the door was pulled wide open with a

single sweeping movement, and Hugo beheld

the figure, slightly dishevelled and more than

slightly perturbed, of Mrs. Albert Shawn.
'Oh, Alb!' cried Lily. 'It's Mr. Hugo!

Oh, Mr. Hugo! whatever next will happen in

this world?'
The swift loosing of the tension of Hugo's

nerves was too much for his self-possession.

He burst into a peal of loud laughter. It was

unnaturally loud, it was hysterical; but it

was genuine laughter, and it did him good.
Lily straightened herself. So far, she had

not admitted Hugo into the chamber.
'It's all very well for you to laugh like that,

Mr. Hugo,' she protested sharply; 'but perhaps

you don't know that you've nearly

killed my husband with that there revolver.

The shot came through the door, and took

him in the arm just as he was emptying this

safe.'
Hugo saw Albert Shawn lying on the

stripped bed, a handkerchief tied round his

arm, and in the corner near the door a large

safe opened, and its contents in a heap on

the floor.
'It's all right, sir,' said Albert; 'come in.

I'm nowhere near croaking. I didn't know

you were on this lay as well as me, sir. I

thought I was going to come down on you

to-morrow with a surprise like a thousand of

bricks.'
'What lay, Albert?' asked Hugo, advancing

into the room.
'The secret-finding lay, sir,' said Albert.
'Your wife has the right to be anxious

about you,' Hugo observed, after a pause.

'But you don't seem to be quite dying,

Shawn; and I think it will be as well if

you explain to me why you have adopted

the profession of burglar. It is extremely

singular that there should have been three

burglars here to-night. You, and then

me—'
'What did I tell you, Alb?' Mrs. Albert

Shawn exclaimed. 'Didn't I tell you I

heard a scuffle?'
'The scuffle was between me and No. 3.

And be it known to you, Mrs. Shawn, that

the revolver was not fired by me, but by

No. 3. I took it off him, afterwards.'
'Then No. 3 must have come on behalf of

Mr. Ravengar, sir,' said Albert.
'You are no doubt right,' Hugo agreed.

'But how did you know that?'
'Hawke's Detective Agency, sir. I found

out before my wedding that one of their men

had been hanging about here, so I chummed

up to him. I spun him a yarn how I'd been

with Hawke's once, and they gave me the

bag, and I wasn't satisfied, and he'd got a

lot of grievances against Hawke's, too, he

had. We got very friendly. Pity I had to

leave the thing for my wedding. But I came

back after a week.'
'Yes, that he did, sir,' said Lily proudly,

'and insisted on it.'
'I soon knew they were going to burglarize

this flat to get some phonograph records.'
'Phonograph records!' Hugo repeated, pondering.
'Yes, sir; and so I thought I'd be beforehand

with 'em.'
'Why didn't you tell me directly you

knew?'
'You gave me that Gaboriau book to read,

sir, and I learnt a lot from it. It's put me

up to a power of things. And, amongst others,

that two people can't manage one job. One

job, one man.'
'You'll excuse Albert, sir,' said Lily;

'that's only his way of talking.'
'It was simply this, sir. I found out

enough to make me as sure as eggs is eggs

that you'd like to have those phonograph

records yourself, without having to inquire

too much where they came from or how they

came.'
'I see.'
'Exactly, sir. Well, to cut a long story

short, sir, I happened to come across something

yesterday that made me think that the

annual sale was going to be interfered with

by parties unknown. But I'd got all I could

manage, and I left that alone; I'd no time

for it. And last night parties unknown tried

to break my leg for me with an open

cellar-flap. I knew it was a plant, and so I pretended

it had succeeded.'
'He made me think his ankle was that

sprained he couldn't walk. He wouldn't

trust even me, sir,' said Lily.
'Gaboriau,' Albert explained briefly. 'I

knew I was watched, and I told Lily to tell

the milkman I couldn't walk. It was all

over Radipole Road at eight o'clock this

morning. And so, while parties unknown

thought I was fast on a sofa, I slipped out

by the back-door as soon as I'd sent Lily

here to warn you about the annual sale, in

case of necessity. I must say I thought I

should be twenty-four hours in front of

Hawke's men, but I expect they changed

their plans. I brought Lily along with me

at the last moment. She's read Gaboriau,

too, sir, and she's mighty handy.'
'I am aware of it,' said Hugo.
'Anyhow, we got in here first, by the side-door

on the balcony. Hawke's man must

have come in about an hour after us, and

you just after him. That's how I reckon it.'
'You went into the drawing-room, didn't

you?' Hugo asked.
'Just looked in.'
'And played with the clock?'
Here he glanced sternly at Lily.
'I shook it to start it, sir, to see if it would

go,' Lily admitted.
'I reckon you turned out Hawke's man,

sir?' Albert queried.
'It amounted to that,' said Hugo. 'But

these phonograph records—what are they?'
'I don't know what they are,' said Albert,

descending from the bed, 'but I know that

Mr. Ravengar wanted them very badly. It

seems Mr. Tudor was a great hand at phonographs

and gramophones. Like me, sir.'
'Yes, sir; we've got a beauty. My uncle

gave it us,' Lily put in. 'Oh, Alb! your

arm's all burst out again.'
The bandage was, in fact, slightly discoloured.
'Oh, that's nothing, my dear,' said Albert.
He pushed up a pile of discs from in front

of the safe, and displayed them to Hugo.
'Can we try them here?' Hugo demanded,

in a voice suddenly and profoundly eager.
'Certainly, sir. Here's the machine. You

undo this catch, and then you—'
Albert was mounted on his latest hobby,

and in a few minutes, although he could only

use one arm, the phonograph, which stood on

the table near the safe, was ready for its work

of reproduction. Albert started it.
'Follow me, follow me!'
It began to sing the famous ditty in the

famous voice of Miss Edna May.
'Stop that!' cried Hugo, and Albert stopped

it.
The next two discs proved to be respectively

a series of stories of Mr. R.G. Knowles and

'The Lost Chord,' played on a cornet. And

these also were cut short. Then came a

bundle of discs tied together. Hugo himself

fixed the top one, and the machine, after

whirring inarticulately, said in slow, clear

tones:
'In case I should die before—'
Hugo arrested the action.
'Go,' he said, almost threateningly, to

Albert and his wife. 'Mrs. Shawn, look after

your husband's wound. It needs it. See the

blood!'
'But—'
'Go,' said Hugo.
And they went.
And when they were gone he released the

mechanism, and in the still solitude of the

bedroom listened to the strange story of

Francis Tudor, related in Francis Tudor's

own voice. It occurred to him that the man

must have been talking into a phonograph

shortly before he died. He remembered the

monotonous voice on that fatal night in

August.

CHAPTER XIX
WHAT THE PHONOGRAPH SAID
In case I should die before I can complete my

arrangements for the future (said the phonograph,

reproducing the voice of Francis

Tudor), I am making a brief statement of the

whole case into this phonograph. I am

exhausted with to-day's work, and I shall find

it easier and much quicker to speak than to

write; and I'm informed that I ought never to

exert myself more than is necessary. Supposing

I were to die within the next few days—and

I have yet to go through the business

of the funeral ceremonies!—circumstances

might arise which might nullify part of my

plan, unless a clear account of the affair should

ultimately come into the hands of some person

whom I could trust not to make a fool of

himself—such as Polycarp, my solicitor, for

instance.
Hence I relate the facts for a private record.
When I first met Camilla Payne she was

shorthand clerk or private secretary, or whatever

you call it, to Louis Ravengar. I saw

her in his office. Curiously, she didn't make

a tremendous impression on me at the

moment. By the way, Polycarp, if it is

indeed you who listen to this, you must excuse

my way of relating the facts. I can only tell

the tale in my own way. Besides meddling

with finance, I've dabbled in pretty nearly all

the arts, including the art of fiction, and I

can't leave out the really interesting pieces of

my narrative merely because you're a lawyer

and hate needless details, sentimental or

otherwise. But do you hate sentimental

details? I don't know. Anyhow, this isn't

a counsel's brief. What was I saying? Oh!

She didn't make a tremendous impression on

me at the moment, but I thought of her afterwards.

I thought of her a good deal in a

quiet way after I had left her—so much so

that I made a special journey to Ravengar's a

few days afterwards, when there was no real

need for me to go, in order to have a look at

her face again. I should explain that I was

dabbling in finance just then, fairly successfully,

and had transactions with Ravengar.

He didn't know that I was the son of the man

who had taken his stepmother away from his

father, and I never told him I had changed

my name, because the scandals attached to it

by Ravengar and his father had made things

very unpleasant for any bearer of that name.

Still, Ravengar happened to be the man I

wanted to deal with, and so I didn't let any

stupid resentment on my part stop me from

dealing with him. He was a scoundrel, but

he played the game, I may incidentally

mention. I venture to give this frank opinion

about one of your most important clients,

because he'll be dead before you read this,

Polycarp. At least, I expect so.
Well, the day I called specially with a view

to seeing her she was not there. She had left

Ravengar's employment, and disappeared.

Ravengar seemed to be rather perturbed about

it. But perhaps he was perturbed about the

suicide which had recently taken place in his

office. I felt it—I mean I felt her disappearance.

However, the memory of her face gave

me something very charming to fall back on

in moments of depression, and it was at this

time something occurred sufficient to make me

profoundly depressed for the remainder of my

life. I was over in Paris, and seeing a good

deal of Darcy, my friend the English doctor

there. We were having a long yarn one night

in his rooms over the Café Américain, and he

said to me suddenly: 'Look here, old chap,

I'm going to do something very unprofessional,

because I fancy you'll thank me for it.'

He said it just like that, bursting out all of a

sudden. So I said, 'Well?' He said: 'It's

very serious, and in nine hundred and ninety-nine

cases out of a thousand I should be a

blundering idiot to tell you.' I said to him:

'You've begun. Finish. And let's see

whether I'll thank you.' He then told me

that I'd got malignant disease of the heart,

might die at any moment, and in any case

couldn't live more than a few years. He said:

'I thought you'd like to know, so that you

could arrange your life accordingly.' I thanked

him. I was really most awfully obliged to him.

It wanted some pluck to tell me. He said: 'I

wouldn't admit to anyone else that I'd told

you.' I never admired Darcy more than I

did that night. His tone was so finely casual.
In something like a month I had got used to

the idea of being condemned to death. At

any rate, it ceased to interfere with my sleep.

I purchased a vault for myself in Brompton

Cemetery. Then I took this flat that I'm

talking in now, and began deliberately to think

over how I should finish my life. I'd got

money—much more than old Ravengar

imagined—and I'm a bit of a philosopher, you

know; I have my theories as to what constitutes

real living. However, I won't bother

you with those. I expect they're pretty

crude, after all. Besides, my preparations

were all knocked on the head. I saw Camilla

Payne again in Hugo's. She had stopped

typewriting, and was a milliner there. I tried

my level best to strike up an intimacy with

her, but I failed. She wouldn't have it. The

fact is, I was too rich and showy. And I had

a reputation behind me which, possibly—well,

you're aware of all that, Polycarp. In about

a fortnight I worshipped her—yes, I did

actually worship her. I would have done

anything she ordered me, except leave her

alone; and that I wouldn't do. I dare say I

might have got into a sort of friendship with

her if she'd had any home, any relatives, any

place to receive me in. But what can a girl

do with nothing but a bed-sitting-room? I

asked her to go up the river; I asked her to

dinner and to lunch, and to bring her friends

with her; I even asked her to go with me to

an A.B.C. shop, but she wouldn't. She was

quite right, in a general way. How could she

guess I wasn't like the rest, or like what I had

been?
Once, when she let me walk with her from

Hugo's down to Walham Green, I nearly went

mad with joy. I think I verily was mad for

a time. I used to take out licenses for our

marriage, and I used to buy clothes for her—heaps

of clothes, in case. Yes, I was as good

as mad then. And when she made it clear

that this walking by my side was nothing at

all, meant nothing, and must be construed as

nothing, I grew still more mad.
At last I wrote to her that if she didn't call

and see me at my flat, I should blow my brains

out. I didn't expect her to call, and I did

expect that I should blow my brains out. I

was ready to do so. A year more or a year

less on this earth—what did it matter to me?
Some people may think—you may think,

Polycarp—that a man like me, under sentence

of death from a doctor, had no right to make

love to a woman. That may be so. But in

love there isn't often any question of right.

Human instincts have no regard for human

justice, and when the instinct is strong enough,

the sense of justice simply ceases to exist for

it. When you're in love—enough—you don't

argue. You desire—that's all.
To my amazement, she came to the flat.

When she was announced, I could scarcely

tell the servant to show her in, and when

she entered, I couldn't speak at all for a

moment. She was so—however, I won't

describe her. I couldn't, for one thing.

No one could describe that woman. She

didn't make any fuss. She didn't cry out that

she had ruined her reputation or anything like

that. She simply said that she had received

my letter, and that she had believed the

sincerity of my threat, while regretting it, and

what did I wish to say to her—she wouldn't

be able to stay long. It goes without saying

I couldn't begin. I couldn't frame a sentence.

So I suggested we should have some tea.

Accordingly, we had some tea. She poured it

out, and we discussed the furniture of the

drawing-room. I might have known she had

fine taste in furniture. She had. When tea

was over, she seemed to be getting a little

impatient. Then I rang for the tray to be

removed, and as soon as we were alone again,

I started: 'Miss Payne—'
Now, when I started like that, I hadn't the

ghost of a notion what I was going to say.

And then the idea stepped into my head all

of a sudden: 'Why not tell her exactly what

your situation is? Why not be frank with

her, and see how it works?' It was an inspiration.

Though I didn't believe in it, and

thought in a kind of despair that I was spoiling

my chances, it was emphatically an inspiration,

and I was obliged to obey it.
So I told her what Darcy had told me. I

explained how it was that I couldn't live long.

I said I had nothing to hope for in this world,

no joy, nothing but blackness and horror. I

said how tremendously I was in love with her.

I said I knew she wasn't in love with me, but

at the same time I thought she ought to have

sufficient insight to see that I was fundamentally

a decent chap. I went so far as to

say that I didn't see how she could dislike me.

And I said: 'I ask you to marry me. It will

only be for a year or two, but that year or

two are all my life, while only a fraction of

yours. I am rich, and after my death you

will be rich, and free from the necessity of this

daily drudgery of yours. But I don't ask you

to marry me for money; I ask you to marry

me out of pity. I ask you, out of kindness to

the most unfortunate and hopeless man in the

world, to give me a trifle out of your existence.

Merely out of pity; merely because it is a

woman's part in the world to render pity and

balm. I won't hide anything from you. There

will be the unpleasant business of my sudden

death, which will be a shock to you, even if you

learn to hate me. But you would get over

that. And you would always afterwards have

the consciousness of having changed the last

months of a man's career from hell to heaven.

There's no disguising the fact that it's a

strange proposition I'm making to you, but

the proposition is not more strange than the

situation. Will you consent, or won't you?'

She was going to say something, but I stopped

her. I said: 'Wait a moment. I shan't try

to terrorize you by threats of suicide. And

now, before you say "Yes" or "No," I give

you my solemn word not to commit suicide if

you say "No."' Then I went on in the same

strain appealing to her pity, and telling her

how humble I should be as a husband.
I could see I had moved her; and now I

think over the scene I fancy that my appeal

must have been a lot more touching than I

imagined it was when I was making it.
She said: 'I have always liked you a little.

But I haven't loved you, and I don't love

you.' And then, after a pause—I was determined

to say nothing more—she said: 'Yes,

I will marry you. I may be doing wrong—I

am certainly doing something very unusual;

but I have no one to advise me against it,

and I will follow my impulse and marry you.

I needn't say that I shall do all I can to be

a good wife to you. Ours will be a curious

marriage.... Perhaps, after all, I am very

wicked!'
I cried out: 'No, you aren't—no you

aren't! The saints aren't in it with you!'
She smiled at this speech. She's so sensible,

Camilla is. She's like a man in some things;

all really great women are.
I could tell you a lot more that passed

immediately afterwards, but I can feel already

my voice is getting a bit tired. Besides, it's

nothing to you, Polycarp.
Then, afterwards, I said: 'You will love

me, you know.'
And I meant it. Any man in similar circumstances

would have said it and meant it.

She smiled again. And then I wanted to be

alone with her, to enjoy the intimacy of her

presence, without a lot of servants all over

the place; so I went out of the drawing-room

and packed off the whole tribe for the evening,

all except Mrs. Dant. I kept Mrs. Dant

to attend on Camilla.
We had dinner sent up; it was like a picnic,

jolly and childish. Camilla was charming.

And then I took photographs of her by flashlight,

with immense success. We developed

them together in the dark-room. That evening

was the first time I had ever been really

happy in all my life. And I was really happy,

although every now and then the idea would

shoot through my head: 'Only for a year or

two at most; perhaps only for a day or two!'
I returned to the dark-room alone for something

or other, and when I came back into

the drawing-room she was not there. By

heaven! my heart went into my mouth. I

feared she had run away, after all. However,

I met her in the passage. She looked

very frightened; her face was quite changed;

but she said nothing had occurred. I kissed

her; she let me.
Soon afterwards she went on to the roof.

She tried to be cheerful, but I saw she had

something on her mind. She said she must

go home, and begged my permission to precede

me into the flat in order to prepare for

her departure. I consented. When ten

minutes had elapsed I followed, and in the

drawing-room, instead of finding Camilla, I

found Louis Ravengar.
I needn't describe my surprise at all that.
Ravengar was beside himself with rage. I

gathered after a time that he claimed Camilla

as his own. He said I had stolen her from

him. I couldn't tell exactly what he was

driving at, but I parleyed with him a little

until I could get my revolver out of a drawer

in my escritoire. He jumped at me. I

thrust him back without firing, and we

stood each of us ready for murder. I couldn't

say how long that lasted. Suddenly he

glanced across the room, and his eyes faltered,

and I became aware that Camilla had entered

silently. I was so startled at her appearance

and by the transformation in Ravengar that

I let off the revolver involuntarily. I heard

Camilla order him, in a sharp, low voice, to

leave instantly. He defied her for a second,

and then went. Before leaving he stuttered,

in a dreadful voice: 'I shall kill you'—

meaning her. 'I may as well hang for one

thing as for another.'
I said to Camilla, gasping: 'What is it all?

What does it mean?'
She then told me, after confessing that she

had caught Ravengar hiding in the dressing-room,

and had actually suspected that I had

been in league with him against her, that

long ago she had by accident seen Ravengar

commit a crime. She would not tell me what

crime; she would give me no particulars.

Still, I gathered that, if not actually murder,

it was at least homicide. After that Ravengar

had pestered her to marry him—had even

said that he would be content with a purely

formal marriage; had offered her enormous

sums to agree to his proposal; and had been

constantly repulsed by her. She admitted to

me that he had appeared to be violently in

love with her, but that his motive in wanting

marriage was to prevent her from giving

evidence against him. I asked her why she

had not communicated with the police long

since, and she replied that nothing would

induce her to do that.
'But,' I said, 'he will do his best to kill

you.'
She said: 'I know it.'
And she said it so solemnly that I became

extremely frightened. I knew Ravengar, and

I had marked the tone of his final words; and

the more I pondered the more profoundly I

was imbued with this one idea: 'The life of

my future wife is not safe. Nothing can

make it safe.'
I urged her to communicate with the police.

She refused absolutely.
'Then one day you will be killed,' I said.
She gazed at me, and said: 'Can't you hit

on some plan to keep me safe for a year?'
I demanded: 'Why a year?'
I thought she was thinking of my short

shrift.
She said: 'Because in a year Mr. Ravengar

will probably have—passed away.'
Not another word of explanation would she

add.
'Yes,' I said; 'I can hit on a plan.'
And, as a matter of fact, a scheme had suddenly

flashed into my head.
She asked me what the scheme was. And

I murmured that it began with our marriage

on the following day. I had in my possession

a license which would enable us to go through

the ceremony at once.
'Trust me,' I said. 'You have trusted me

enough to agree to marry me. Trust me in

everything.'
I did not venture to tell her just then what

my scheme was.
She went to her lodging that night in my

brougham. After she had gone I found poor

old Mrs. Dant drugged in the kitchen. On

the next morning Camilla and I were married

at a registry office. She objected to the

registry-office at first, but in the end she

agreed, on the condition that I got her a

spray of orange-blossom to wear at her breast.

It's no business of yours, Polycarp, but I may

tell you that this feminine trait, this almost

childish weakness, in a woman of so superb

and powerful a character, simply enchanted

me. I obtained the orange-blossom.
Then you will remember I sent for you,

Polycarp, made my will, and accompanied

you to my safe in your private vault, in order

to deposit there some secret instructions. I

shall not soon forget your mystification, and

how you chafed under my imperative commands.
Camilla and I departed to Paris, my brain

full of my scheme, and full of happiness, too.

We went to a private hotel to which Darcy

had recommended us, suitable for honeymoons.

The following morning I was, perhaps,

inclined to smile a little at our terror of

Ravengar; but, peeping out of the window

early, I saw Ravengar himself standing on

the pavement in the Rue St. Augustin.
I told Camilla I was going out, and that

she must not leave that room, nor admit

anyone into it, until I returned. I felt that

Ravengar, what with disappointed love, and

jealousy, and fear of the consequences of a

past crime, had developed into a sort of

monomaniac in respect to Camilla. I felt

he was capable of anything. I should not

have been surprised if he had hired a room

opposite to us on the other side of that narrow

street, and directed a fusillade upon Camilla.
When I reached the street he had disappeared—melted

away.
It was quite early. However, I walked up

the Rue de Grammont, and so to Darcy's, and

I routed him out of bed. I gave him the

entire history of the case. I convinced him

of its desperateness, and I unfolded to him

my scheme. At first he fought shy of it.

He said it might ruin him. He said such

things could not be done in London. I had

meant to carry out the scheme in this flat.

Hence the reason, Polycarp, of the clause in

my will which provides for the sealing up of

the flat in case I die within two months of

my wedding. You see, I feared that I might

be cut off before the plan was carried out or

before all traces of it were cleared away, and

I wanted to keep the place safe from prying

eyes. As it happened, there was no need for

such a precaution, as you will see, and I shall

make a new will to-morrow.
Darcy said suddenly: 'Why not carry out

your plan here in Paris; and now?'
The superior advantages of this alternative

were instantly plain. It would be safer for

Camilla, since it would operate at once; and

also Darcy said that the formal details could

be arranged much better in Paris than in

London, as doctors could be found there who

would sign anything, and clever sculptors,

who did not mind a peculiar commission,

were more easily obtainable in the Quartier

Montparnasse than in the neighbourhood of

the Six Bells and the Arts Club, Chelsea.
We found the doctor and the sculptor.
The hotel was informed that Camilla was

ill, and that the symptom pointed to typhoid

fever. Naturally, she kept her room. That

day the sculptor, a young American, who said

that a thing was 'bully' when he meant it

was good, arrived, and took a mask of Camilla's

head. By the way, this was a most tedious

and annoying process. The two straws

through which the poor girl had to breathe

while her face was covered with that white

stuff—! Oh, well, I needn't go into that.
The next day typhoid fever was definitely

announced. Hotels generally prefer these

things to be kept secret, but we published it

everywhere—it was part of our plan. In a

few hours the entire Rue St. Augustin was

aware that the English bride recently arrived

from London was down with typhoid fever.
The disease ran its course. Sometimes

Camilla was better, sometimes worse. Then

all of a sudden a hæmorrhage supervened,

and the young wife died, and the young husband

was stricken with trouble and grief.

The whole street mourned. The death even

got into the Paris dailies, and the correspondence

column of the Paris edition of the New

York Herald was filled with outcries against

the impurities of Parisian water.
It was colossal. I laughed, Polycarp.
My mind unhinged by sorrow, I insisted on

taking the corpse to London for burial. I

had a peculiar affection for the Brompton

Cemetery, though neither her ancestors nor

mine had been buried there. I insisted on

Darcy accompanying me. The procession

left the Rue St. Augustin, and the hotel was

disinfected. This alone cost me a thousand

francs. I gave the sculptor one thousand

five hundred, and the doctor two thousand.

Then there were the expenses of the journey

with the coffin. I forget the figure, but I

know it was prodigious.
But I was content. For, of course, Camilla

was not precisely in that coffin. Camilla had

not been suffering from precisely typhoid

fever. In strict fact, she had never been ill

the least bit in the world. In strict fact, she

had been spirited out of the hotel one night,

and at the very moment when her remains

were crossing the Channel in charge of an

inconsolable widower, she was in the middle

of the Mediterranean on a steamer. The

coffin contained a really wonderful imitation

of her outward form, modelled and coloured

by the American sculptor in a composition

consisting largely of wax. The widower's one

grief was that he was forced to separate himself

from his life's companion for a period of,

at least, a week.
A pretty enough scheme, wasn't it, Polycarp?

We shall shortly bury the wax effigy

in Brompton Cemetery, with the assistance

of Hugo's undertakers, and a parson or so,

and grave-diggers, and registrars of deaths,

and so on and so on. Louis Ravengar will

breathe again, thankful that typhoid fever

has relieved him of an unpleasant incubus,

and since Camilla is underground, he will

speedily forget all about her. She will be

absolutely safe from him. The inconsolable

widower will ostentatiously seek distraction

in foreign travel, and in a fortnight, at most,

will, under another name, resume his connubial

career in a certain villa unsurpassed,

I am told, for its picturesque situation.
To-morrow or the next day I must make

that new will, dispensing with the shutting-up

of the flat. The secret instructions, however,

will stand.
You may wonder why I confide all this to

the phonograph, Polycarp. I will tell you.

The record will be placed by me to-morrow

in my safe in your vault. To-night I shall

lock it up in the safe here. When I am dead,

Polycarp, you will find that the secret instructions

instruct you to realize all my

estate, and to keep the proceeds in negotiable

form until a lady named Mrs. Catherine

Pounds, a widow, comes to you with an autograph

letter from me. You will hand everything

to that lady, or to her representative,

without any further inquiry. But it has

struck me this very day, Polycarp, that you,

with your confounded suspicious and legal

nature, when you see Mrs. Catherine Pounds,

if she should come in person, may recognise

in her a striking resemblance to Camilla.

And you may put difficulties in the way, and

rake up history which was not meant to be

raked up. This phonographic record is to

prevent you from doing so, if by chance you

have an impulse to do so. Think it over

carefully, Polycarp. Consider our situation,

and obey my instructions without a murmur.

The thought of the false death certificates and

burial certificates, and of the unprofessionalism

of Darcy, will abrade your legal susceptibilities;

but submit to the torture for

my sake, Polycarp. You are human. I

shall add to the letter which Mrs. Catherine

Pounds will bring you a note to say that if

you have any scruples, you are to listen to

the phonographic records in the safe; if not,

you are to destroy the phonographic records.
Do I seem gay, Polycarp?
I ought to be. I have carried through my

scheme. I have outwitted Ravengar. I have

saved Camilla from death at his hands. I

can look forward to an idyll—brief, perhaps,

but ecstatic—in a villa with the loveliest

view on all the Mediterranean. I ought to

be gay. And yet I am not. And it is not

the knowledge of my fatal disease that

saddens me. No; I think I have been saddened

by a day and a night spent with that

coffin. It is a fraud of a coffin, but it exists.

And when I saw it just now occupying the

drawing-room, it gave me a sudden shock.

It somehow took hold of my imagination. I

was obliged to look within, and to touch the

waxen image there. And that image seemed

unholy. I did not care to dwell on the

thought of it going into the ground, with all

the solemnities of the real thing. What do

you suppose will happen to that waxen image

on the Judgment Day, Polycarp? Surely,

someone in authority, possibly a steward,

fussy and overworked, will exclaim: 'There

is some mistake here!' I can hear you say

that I am mad, Polycarp, that Francis Tudor

was always a little 'wrong.' But I am not

mad. It is only that my brain is too agile,

too fanciful. I am a great deal more sane

than you, Polycarp.
And I am trying to put some heart into

myself. I am trying to make ready to enjoy

the brief ecstatic future where Camilla awaits

me. But I am so tired, Polycarp. And

there's no disguising the fact that it's an

awful nuisance never to be quite sure whether

you won't fall down dead the next minute or

the next second. I must go in and have

another glance at that singular swindle of a

coffin.

The phonograph went off into an inarticulate

whirr of its own machinery. The recital

was over. Tudor must have died immediately

after securing the record in the safe in his

bedroom, where Hugo had just listened to it.
'She lives!' was Hugo's sole thought.
The profound and pathetic tragedy of

Tudor's career did not touch him until long

afterwards.
'She lives! Ravengar lives! Ravengar

probably knows where she is, and I do not

know! And Ravengar is at large! I have set

him at large.'
His mind a battlefield on which the most

glorious hope struggled against a frenzied fear,

Hugo rose from the chair in front of the

phonograph-stand, and, after a slight hesitation,

left the flat as he had entered it. Before

dawn the pane had been replaced in the

drawing-room window, and the side-door

secured.

PART III
THE TOMB

CHAPTER XX
'ARE YOU THERE?'
The next morning Hugo's dreams seemed to

be concerned chiefly with a telephone, and the

telephone-bell of his dreams made the dreams

so noisy that even while asleep he knew that

his rest was being outrageously disturbed.

He tried to change the subject of his fantastic

visions, but he could not, and the telephone-bell

rang nearly all the time. This was the

more annoying in that he had taken elaborate

precautions to secure perfect repose. Perfect

repose was what he needed after quitting

Tudor's flat. He felt that he had stood as

much as a man can expect himself to stand.

In the vault, and again in the flat, his life had

been in danger; he had suffered the ignominy

of the ruined sale; he had come to grips with

Ravengar, and let Ravengar go free; he had

listened to the amazing recital of the phonograph.

Moreover, between the interview with

Ravengar and the burglary of the flat he had

summoned his Council of Ten, or, rather, his

Council of Nine (Bentley being absent, dead),

had addressed all his employés, had separated

three traitorous shopwalkers, ten traitorous

cashiers, and forty-two traitorous servers

from the main body, and sent them packing,

had arranged for the rehabilitation of Lady

Brice (née Kentucky-Webster), had appointed

a new guardian to the Safe Deposit, had got

on the track of the stolen stoles, and had

approved special advertisements for every

daily paper in London.
And, finally and supremely, he had experienced

the greatest stroke of joy, ecstatic and

bewildering joy, of his whole existence—the

news that Camilla lived. It was this tremendous

feeling of joy, and not by any means his

complex and variegated worries, that might

have prevented him from obtaining the sleep

which Nature demanded.
On reaching the dome at 2 a.m., he had

taken four tabloids, each containing 0·324

gramme of trional, and had drunk the glass

of hot milk which Simon always left him in

case he should want it. And he had written

on a sheet of paper the words: 'I am not to

be disturbed before 10 a.m., no matter what

happens; but call me at ten.—H.'; and had

put the sheet of paper on Simon's door-mat.

And then he had stumbled into bed, and abandoned

himself to sleep—not without reluctance,

for he did not care to lose, even for a

few hours, the fine consciousness of that sheer

joy. He desired to rush off instantly into

the universe at large and discover Camilla,

wherever she might be.
Of course, he had dreamed of Camilla, but

the telephone-bell had drowned the remembered

accents of her voice. The telephone-bell

had silenced everything. The telephone-bell

had grown from a dream into a nightmare;

and at last he had said to himself in the

nightmare: 'I might just as well be up and

working as lying throttled here by this confounded

nightmare.' And by an effort of will

he had wakened. And even after he was

roused, and had switched on the light, which

showed the hands of the clock at a quarter to

ten, he could still hear the telephone-bell of

his nightmare. And then the truth occurred

to him, as the truth does occur surprisingly

to people whose sleep has been disturbed,

that the telephone-bell was a real telephone-bell,

and not in the least the telephone-bell

of a dream, and it was ringing, ringing,

ringing in the dome. There were fifteen lines

of telephone in the Hugo building, and one of

them ran to the dome. Few persons called

him up on it, because few persons knew its

precise number, but he used it considerably

himself.
'Anyhow,' he murmured, 'I've had over

seven and a half hours' sleep, and that's

something.'
And as he got out of bed to go across to the

telephone, his great joy resumed possession

of him, and he was rather glad than otherwise

that the telephone had forced him to wake.
'Well, well, well?' he cried comically,

lifting the ear-piece off the hook and stopping

the bell.
'Are you there?' the still small voice of

the telephone whispered in his ear.
'I should think I was here!' he cried.

'Who are you?'
'Are you Mr. Hugo?' asked the voice.
'I'm what's left of Mr. Hugo,' he answered

in a sort of drunken tone. The power of the

sedative was still upon him. 'Who are you?

You've pretty nearly rung my head off.'
'I just want to say good-bye to you,' said

the voice.
'What!'
Hugo started, glancing round the vast room,

which was in shadow except where a solitary

light threw its yellow glare on the dial of the

clock.
'Are you there?' asked the voice patiently

once again.
'It isn't'—something prompted him to use

a Christian name—'it isn't Louis?'
'Yes.'
'Where are you, then?' Hugo demanded.
'Not far off,' replied the mysterious voice

in the telephone.
It was unmistakably the voice of Louis

Ravengar, but apparently touched with some

new quality, some quality of resigned and

dignified despair. Hugo wondered where the

man could be. And the sinister magic of

the telephone, which brought this sad, quiet

voice to him from somewhere out of the

immensity of England, but which would not

yield up the secret of its hiding, struck him

strangely.
'Are you there?' said the voice yet again.
'Yes.'
Hugo shivered, but whether it was from

cold—he wore nothing but his pyjamas—or

from apprehension he could not decide.
'I'm saying good-bye,' said the voice once

more. 'I suppose you mean to have the

police after me, and so I mean to get out of

their way. See? But first I wished to tell

you—crrrck cluck—Eh? What?'
'I didn't speak.'
'It's these Exchange hussies, then. I

wanted to tell you I've thought a lot about our

interview last night. What you said was true

enough, Owen. I admit that, and so I am

going to end it. Eh? Are you there?

That girl keeps putting me off.'
'End what?'
'End it—it—it! I'm not making anybody

happy, not even myself, and so I'm going to

end it. But I'll tell you her address first. I

know it.'
'Whose address?'
'Hers—Camilla's. If I tell you, will you

promise not to say a word about me speaking

to you on the telephone this morning?'
'Yes.'
'Not a word under any circumstances?'
'Certainly.'
'Well, it's 17, Place Saint-Étienne, Bruges,

Belgium.'
'17, Place Saint-Étienne, Bruges. That's

all right. I shan't forget. Look here, Louis,

you'd better clear out of England. Go to

America. Do you hear? I don't understand

this about "ending it." You surely aren't

thinking of—'
He felt quite magnanimous towards Ravengar.

And he was aware that he could get to

Bruges in six hours or so.
'That idea of yours about chloroform,' said

the voice, 'and going into the vault, and being

shut up there, is a very good one. Nobody

would know, except the person whom one

paid to shut the door after one.'
'I say, where are you?' Hugo asked curtly.

He was at a loss how to treat these singular

confidences.
'And so is that idea good about merely

ending one incarnation and beginning another.

That's much better than calling it death.'
'I shall ring you off,' said Hugo.
'Wait a moment,' said the voice, still

patiently. 'If you should hear the name

Callear—'
There was a pause.
'Well?' Hugo inquired, 'what name?'
'Callear—C-a-l-l-e-a-r. If you should hear

that name soon—'
'What then?'
'Remember your promise of secrecy—that's

all. Good-bye.'
'I wish you'd tell me where you are.'
'Not far off,' said the voice. 'I shall never

be far off, I think. When you've found

Camilla and brought her here'—the tone of

the voice changed and grew almost malignant

despite its reticence—'you'd like to know

that I was always near to, somewhere underneath,

mouldering, wouldn't you?'
'What did you say?'
'I said mouldering. Good-bye.'
'But look here—'
The bell rang off. Louis Ravengar had

finished his good-bye. Hugo tried in vain to

resume communication with him. He could

not even get any sort of reply from the

Exchange.
'It's a queer world,' he soliloquized, as he

returned to bed. 'What does the man mean?'
He was still happy in the prospect of finding

Camilla, but it was as though his happiness

were a pool in a private ground, and some

trespasser had troubled it with a stone.
The clock struck ten, and Simon entered

with tea and the paper.

CHAPTER XXI
SUICIDE
The paper contained a whole-page advertisement

of Hugo's great annual sale, and

also a special half-page advertisement headed

'Hugo's Apology and Promise'—a message

to the public asking pardon of the public for

the confusion, inconvenience, and disappointments

of the previous day, hinting that the

mystery of the affair would probably be

elucidated in a criminal court, and stating

that a prodigious number of silvered fox-stoles

would positively be available from nine

o'clock that morning at a price even lower

than the figure named in the original announcement.

The message further stated

that a special Complaint Office had been

opened as a branch of the Inquiry Bureau,

and that all complaints by customers who had

suffered on New Year's Day would there be

promptly and handsomely dealt with.
In addition to Hugo's advertisements,

there were several columns of news describing

the singular phenomena of the sale, concluding

with what a facetious reporter had entitled

'Interviews with Survivors.'
As he read the detailed accounts Hugo

knew, perhaps for the first time in his life,

what it was 'to go hot and cold all over.'

However, he was decidedly inclined to be

optimistic.
'Anyhow,' he said, 'it's the best ad. I ever

had. Still, it's a mercy there were no deaths.'
He began to dress hurriedly, furiously.

Already the second day of the sale had been

in progress for more than an hour, and he had

not even visited the scene of the campaign.

Simon had said nothing; it was not Simon's

habit to speak till he was spoken to. And

Hugo did not feel inclined to ask questions;

he preferred to reconnoitre in person. Yes,

he would descend instantly, and afterwards,

when he had satisfied himself that the evil

had been repaired, he would consider about

Camilla.... By neglecting all else, he

could reach her in time for dinner.... Should

he?... (At this point he plunged

into his cold bath.) ... No! He was Hugo

before he was Camilla's lover. He would be

a tradesman for yet another ten hours. He

had a duty to London....
Then Ravengar wandered into his thoughts

and confused them.
Just as he was assuming his waistcoat,

Simon entered.
'Mr. Galpin, sir.'
'And who the d---l is Mr. Galpin?' asked

Hugo.
'Mr. Galpin is the gentleman who saved

your life yesterday, sir,' said Simon with

admirable sangfroid. 'He has called for a

hundred pounds.'
'Show him in here immediately,' said Hugo.
Mr. Galpin appeared in the dressing-room,

looking more than ever like an extremely

successful commercial traveller. Hugo could

not think of any introductory remark worthy

of the occasion.
'I needn't say how grateful I am,' Hugo

began.
'Certainly you needn't,' said Mr. Galpin.

'I understand. I've been under lock and

key myself.'
'I should offer you more than this paltry

sum,' said Hugo, with a smile, 'but I know,

of course, that a man like you can always

obtain all the money he really wants.'
Mr. Galpin smiled, too.
'However,' continued Hugo, detaching his

watch from his waistcoat, 'I will ask you to

take something that you can't get elsewhere.

This is the thinnest watch in the world.

Bréguet, of the Rue de la Paix, Paris, made it

specially for me. It is exactly the same size

as a five-shilling piece. It repeats the quarters,

shows the time in four cities, and does practically

everything except tell the weather

and the political party in power. It has one

drawback. Only Bréguet can clean it, and

he will charge you five guineas for the job,

besides probably having you arrested for

unlawful possession. I must write to him.

Such as it is, accept it.'
The golden, jewelled toy was offered and

received with a bow. The practised hands of

Mr. Galpin had opened the case in two

seconds.
'How do you regulate it?' demanded Mr.

Galpin, staring at the movement.
'You don't,' said Hugo proudly; 'it never

needs it.'
Mr. Galpin stood corrected.
'If there's anything in my line I can do for

you at any time, sir,' said he.
Hugo pondered.
Mr. Galpin put the watch in his waistcoat-pocket,

and, tearing the hundred-pound note

in two halves, placed one half in the left breast

pocket of his coat, and the other half in the

right breast pocket of his coat.
'Could you have opened that vault,' Hugo

asked, 'if both keys had been lost?'
'No, sir, I could not. It's such people as

you who are ruining my profession, sir.'
'You think the vault is impregnable?'
'Yes, sir,' said Mr. Galpin. 'I should say

its name was just about as near being Gibraltar

as makes no matter.'
'I was only wondering,' Hugo mused aloud,

'only wondering.... Ah, well, I won't

trouble you with my fancies.'
'As you wish, sir. Good-bye.'
'Good-bye, Mr. Galpin. And thank you!'
'Thank you, sir,' said Mr. Galpin, and disappeared.
'Simon,' Hugo ordered immediately afterwards,

handing Simon the token, 'run down

and get me the best gold watch in the place.'
Throughout the morning Hugo's thoughts

were far away. Most frequently they were

in Belgium, but now and then they paid a

strange incomprehensible visit with Ravengar

to the vault.
While he was lunching under the dome,

Albert Shawn came in with the early edition

of the Evening Herald, containing a prominent

item headed, 'Feared Suicide of Mr. Louis

Ravengar.' The paper stated that Mr.

Ravengar had gone to Dover on the previous

evening, had been seen to board the Calais

steamer, and had been missed soon after the

boat had left the harbour. His hat, umbrella,

rug, and bag had been found on deck. As

the night was quite calm, there could be no

other explanation than that of suicide. The

Evening Herald gave a sympathetic biography

of Mr. Ravengar ('one of our proprietors'),

and attributed his suicide to a fit of depression

caused by the entirely groundless rumours

which had circulated during the late afternoon

connecting him with the scandalous disturbances

at Hugo's sale.
Hugo dropped the organ of public opinion.
'H'm!' he observed to Albert.
'I'm not surprised, sir,' said Albert.
'Aren't you?' said Hugo. 'Then, there's

nothing more to be said.'
Since Louis Ravengar had certainly been

talking with Hugo that selfsame morning, it

was obviously impossible that he should have

committed suicide in the English Channel

some twelve hours earlier. Why, then, had

he arranged for this elaborate deception to

be practised? What was his scheme? His

voice through the telephone had been so quiet,

so resigned, so pathetic; only towards the end

had it become malevolent.
Hugo perceived that he must go down to

the vault. No! He dared not go himself.

The sight of that vault, after yesterday's

emotions, would surely be beyond his power

to bear!
'Albert,' he said, 'go to the Safe Deposit.'
'Yes, sir.'
'And inquire if anyone named—'
Hugo stopped.
'Named what, sir?'
'Never mind. I'll go myself. By the

way,' he said, 'I must run over to Belgium

to-night. Perhaps I may take you with me.'
'Don't forget the inquest on Bentley

to-morrow, sir. You'll have to attend that.'
Hugo made a gesture of excessive annoyance.

He had forgotten the inquest.
'Take this telegram,' he said, suddenly

inspired; and he scribbled out the following

words: 'Darcy, 16, Boulevard des Italiens,

Paris. Please come instantly; urgent case.—HUGO,

London.'
'At any rate, I've made a beginning,' he

murmured when Albert had gone. 'I can

find out all that is to be known about Camilla

from Darcy—if he comes. I wonder if he'll

come. He'd better.'
And then, collecting his powers of self-control,

he went slowly down to the Safe

Deposit, and entered those steely and dreadful

portals.
'Getting on all right?' he said to the newly-installed

manager, a young man with light

hair from the counting-house.
'Oh yes, Mr. Hugo.'
'Any new customers?'
He trembled for the reply.
'Yes, sir. Two gentlemen came as soon as

we opened this morning, and took Vault 39.

They paid a year's rent in advance. Two

hundred pounds.'
'What did they want a whole vault for?'
'I can't say, sir. There was a lot of going

to and fro with parcels and things, sir, and a

lot of telephoning in the waiting-room. And

one of them asked for a glass and some water.

They were here a long time, sir.'
'When did they go?'
'It was about ten-thirty, sir, when one of

the two gentlemen called me to bring my key

and lock up the vault. The vault was properly

locked, first with his key, and then with mine,

and then he left. Perhaps it might be a

quarter to eleven, sir.'
'But the other gentleman?'
'Oh, he must have slipped off earlier, sir.

I didn't see him go.'
'What did he look like?'
'Oldish man, Mr. Hugo. Gray.'
The manager was somewhat mystified by

this cross-examination.
'And the name?'
'The name? Let me see. Callear. Yes,

Callear, sir.'
'What?'
'C-a-l-l-e-a-r.'
'What was the address?'
'Hotel Cecil. He said he would send a

permanent address in a day or two.'
In half an hour Hugo had ascertained that

no person named Callear was staying at the

Hotel Cecil.
He understood now, understood too clearly,

the meanings of Ravengar's strange utterances

on the telephone. The man had determined to

commit suicide, and he had chosen a way

which was calculated with the most appalling

ingenuity to ruin, if anything would ruin,

Hugo's peace of mind for years to come—perhaps

for ever. For the world, Ravengar

was drowned. But Hugo knew that his body

was lying in that vault.
'Louis had an accomplice,' Hugo reflected.

'Who can that have been? Who could have

been willing to play so terrible a rôle?'

CHAPTER XXII
DARCY
That night, when he was just writing out

some cheques in aid of charities conducted by

Lady Brice (née Kentucky-Webster), Simon

entered with a card. The hour was past eleven.
Hugo read on the card, 'Docteur Darcy.'
He had nearly forgotten that he had sent

for Darcy; in fact, he was no longer quite sure

why he had sent for him, since he meant, in

any case, to hasten to Belgium at the earliest

moment.
'You are exceedingly prompt, doctor,' he

said, when Darcy came into the dome. 'I

thank you.'
The cosmopolitan physician appeared to be

wearing the same tourist suit that he had

worn on the night of Tudor's death. The

sallowness of his impassive face had increased

somewhat, and his long thin hands had their

old lackadaisical air. 'You don't look at all

the man for such a part,' said Hugo in the

privacy of his brain, 'but you played your

part devilish well that night, my pale friend.

You deceived me perfectly.'
'Prompt?' smiled the doctor, shaking

hands, and removing his overcoat with

fatigued gestures.
'Yes; you must have caught the 4 p.m.

express, and come via Folkstone and Boulogne.'
'I did,' said Darcy.
'And yet I expect you didn't get my telegram

till after two o'clock.'
'I have received no telegram from you, my

dear Mr. Hugo. It had not arrived when I

left.'
'Then your presence here to-night is due

to a coincidence merely?'
'Not at all,' said Darcy; 'it is due to an

extreme desire on my part to talk to you.'
'The desire is mutual,' Hugo answered,

gently insisting that Darcy should put away

his cigarettes and take a Muria. 'Dare I

ask—'
Darcy had become suddenly nervous, and

he burst out, interrupting Hugo:
'The suicide of Mr. Ravengar was in this

morning's Paris papers. And I may tell you

at once that it's in connection with that affair

that I'm here.'
'I also—' Hugo began.
'I may tell you at once,' Darcy proceeded

with increasing self-consciousness, 'that when

I had the pleasure of meeting you before, Mr.

Hugo, I was forced by circumstances, and by

my promise to a dead friend, to behave in a

manner which was very distasteful to me. I

was obliged to lie to you, to play a trick on

you—in short—well, I can only ask you for

your sympathy. I have a kind of a forlorn

notion that you'll understand—after I've

explained, as I mean to do—'
'If you refer to the pretended death of

Tudor's wife—' said Hugo.
'Then you know?' Darcy cried, astounded.
'I know. I know everything, or nearly

everything.'
'How?' Darcy retreated towards the piano.
'I will explain how some other time,' Hugo

replied, going also to the piano and facing

his guest. 'You did magnificently that night,

doctor. Don't imagine for a moment that

my feelings towards you in regard to that

disastrous evening are anything but those

of admiration. And now tell me about her—about

her. She is well?'
Hugo put a hand on the man's shoulder,

and persuaded him back to his chair.
'She is well—I hope and believe,' answered

Darcy.
'You don't see her often?'
'On the contrary, I see her every day,

nearly.'
'But if she lives at Bruges and you are in

Paris—'
'Bruges?'
'Yes; Place Saint-Étienne.'
Darcy thought for a second.
'So it's you who have been on the track,'

he murmured.
Hugo, too, became meditative in his turn.
'I wish you would tell me all that happened

since—since that night,' he said at

length.
'I ask nothing better,' said Darcy. 'Since

Ravengar is dead and all danger passed, there

is no reason why you should not know everything

that is to be known. Well, Mr. Hugo,

I have had an infinity of trouble with that

girl.'
Hugo's expression gave pause to the doctor.
'I mean with Mrs. Tudor,' he added correctively.

'I'll begin at the beginning. After

the disappearance—the typhoid disappearance,

you know—she went to Algiers. Tudor

had taken a villa at Mustapha Supérieure,

the healthiest suburb of the town. After

Tudor's sudden death I telegraphed to her

to come back to me in Paris. I couldn't

bring myself to wire that Tudor was dead.

I only said he was ill. And at first she

wouldn't come. She thought it was a ruse

of Ravengar's. She thought Ravengar had

discovered her hiding-place, and all sorts of

things. However, in the end she came. I

met her at Marseilles. You wouldn't believe,

Mr. Hugo, how shocked she was by the news

of her husband's death. Possibly I didn't

break it to her too neatly. She didn't pretend

to love him—never had done—but she

was shocked all the same. I had a terrible

scene with her at the Hotel Terminus at Marseilles.

Her whole attitude towards the marriage

changed completely. She insisted that

it was plain to her then that she had simply

sold herself for money. She said she hated

herself. And she swore she would never

touch a cent of Tudor's fortune—not even

if the fortune went to the Crown in default

of legal representatives.'
'Poor creature!' Hugo breathed.
'However,' Darcy proceeded, 'something

had to be done. She was supposed to be

dead, and if her life was to be saved from

Ravengar's vengeance, she just had to continue

to be dead—at any rate, as regards

England. So she couldn't go back to England.

Now I must explain that my friend

Tudor hadn't left her with much money.'
'That was careless.'
'It was,' Darcy admitted. 'Still, he

naturally relied on me in case of necessity.

And quite rightly. I was prepared to let

Mrs. Tudor have all the money she wanted,

she repaying me as soon as events allowed

her to handle Tudor's estate. But as she

had decided never to handle Tudor's estate,

she had no prospect of being able to repay

me. Hence she would accept nothing. Hence

she began to starve. Awkward, wasn't it?'
'I see clearly that she could not come to

England to earn her living,' said Hugo, 'but

could she not have earned it in Paris?'
'No,' Darcy replied; 'she couldn't earn it

regularly. And the reason was that she was

too beautiful. Situation after situation was

made impossible for her. She might easily

have married in Paris, but earn her living

there—no! In the end she was obliged to

accept money from me, but only in very

small sums, such as she could repay without

much difficulty when Ravengar's death should

permit her to return to England. She was

always sure of Ravengar's death, but she

would never tell me why. And now he's dead.'
'And there is no further obstacle to her

coming to England?'
'None whatever. That is to say—except

one.'
'What do you mean?' Hugo demanded.
Darcy had flushed.
'I'm in a very delicate position,' said Darcy.

'I've got to explain to you something that a

man can't explain without looking an ass.

The fact is—of course, you see, Mr. Hugo, I

did all I could for her all the time. Not out

of any special regard for her, but for Tudor's

sake, you understand. She's awfully beautiful,

and all that. I've nothing against her.

But I believe I told you last year that I had

been in love once. That "once" was enough.

I've done with women, Mr. Hugo.'
'But how does this affect—' Hugo began

to inquire, rather inimically.
'Can't you see? She doesn't want to

leave Paris. I did all I could for her all the

time. I've been her friend in adversity, and

so on, and so on, and she's—she's—'
'What on earth are you driving at, man?'
'She's fallen in love with me. That's what

I'm driving at. And now you know.'
'My dear sir,' said Hugo earnestly, 'if she

is in love with you, you must marry her and

make her happy.'
He did not desire to say this, but some

instinct within him compelled him to utter

the words.
'You told me that you loved her,' Darcy

retorted.
'I told you the truth. I do.'
A silence ensued. All Hugo's previous discouragements,

sadnesses, preoccupations, despairs,

were as nothing in comparison with

the black mood which came upon him when

he learnt this simple fact—that Camilla had

fallen in love with Darcy.
'She is still in Paris?' he asked, to end the

silence.
'I—I don't know. I called at her lodgings

at noon, and she had gone and left no address.'
Hugo jumped up.
'She can't have disappeared again?'
'Oh no; rest assured. Doubtless a mere

change of rooms. When I return I shall

certainly find a letter awaiting me.'
'Why did you come to me?'
'Well,' Darcy said, 'you told me you loved

her, and I thought—I thought perhaps you'd

come over to Paris, and see—see what could

be done. That's why I came. The thing's

on my mind, you know.'
'Just so,' Hugo answered, 'and I will

come.'

CHAPTER XXIII
FIRST TRIUMPH OF SIMON
A week later, Simon and Albert stood talking

together in Simon's room adjoining the dome.

Simon had that air of absolute spruceness and

freshness which in persons who have stayed

at home is so extremely offensive to persons

who have just arrived exhausted and unclean

from a tiresome journey. It was Albert who,

with Hugo, had arrived from the journey.
'Had a good time, Alb?' Simon asked.
'So-so,' said Albert cautiously.
'By the way, what did you go to Paris for?'
'Didn't you know?'
'How should I know, my son?'
'The governor wanted to find that girl of

his.'
'What girl?' Simon asked innocently.
'Oh, chuck it, Si!' Albert remonstrated

against these affectations of ignorance in a

relative from whom he had no secrets.
'You mean Mrs. Tudor?'
'Yes.'
'She's disappeared again, has she? And

you couldn't find her?'
Albert concurred.
'It seems to me, Alb,' said Simon, 'that

you aren't shining very brilliantly just now

as a detective. And I'm rather surprised,

because I've been doing a bit of detective

work myself, and it's nothing but just using

your eyes.'
'What have you been up to?' Albert inquired.
'Oh, nothing. Never you mind. It's

purely unofficial. You see, I'm not a

detective. I'm only a servant that gets left

at home. I've only been amusing myself.

Still, I've found out a thing or two that you'd

give your eyes to know, my son.'
'What?'
Albert pursued his quest of knowledge.
'You get along home to your little wife,'

Simon enjoined him. 'You're a professional

detective, you are. No doubt when you've

recovered from Paris, and got into your stride,

you'll find out all that I know and a bit over

in about two seconds. Off you go!'
Simon's eyes glinted.
And later, when he was giving Hugo the

last ministrations for the night, Simon looked

at his lord as a cat looks at the mouse it is

playing with—humorously, viciously, sarcastically.
'I'll give him a night to lie awake in,' said

Simon's eyes.
But he only allowed his eyes to make

this speech while Hugo's back was turned.
The next morning Hugo's mood was desolating.

To speak to him was to play with

fire. Obviously, Hugo had heard the clock

strike all the hours. Nevertheless, Simon

permitted himself to be blithe, even offensively

blithe. And when Hugo had finished

with him he ventured to linger.
'You needn't wait,' said Hugo, in a voice

of sulphuric acid.
'So you didn't find Mrs. Francis Tudor,

sir?' responded Simon, with calm and beautiful

insolence.
It was insolence because, though few of

Hugo's secrets were hid from Simon, the

intercourse between master and servant

was conducted on the basis of a convention

that Simon's ignorance of Hugo's affairs was

complete. And if the convention was ignored,

as it sometimes was, Hugo alone had

the right to begin the ignoring of it.
'What's that you said?' Hugo demanded.
'You didn't find Mrs. Francis Tudor, sir?'

Simon blandly repeated.
'Mind your own business, my friend,' he

said.
'Certainly, sir,' said Simon. 'But I had

intended to add that possibly you had not

been searching for Mrs. Tudor in the right

city.'
Hugo stared at Simon, who retreated to

the door.
'What in thunder do you mean?' Hugo

asked coldly and deliberately.
At last Simon felt a tremor.
'I mean, sir, that I think I know where

she is. At least, I know where she will be

in a couple of hours' time.'
'Where?'
'In Department 42—her old department,

sir.'
By a terrific effort Hugo kept calm.
'Simon,' he said, 'don't play any tricks on

me. If you do, I'll thrash you first, and then

dismiss you on the spot.'
'It's through the new manager of the

drapery, sir, in place of Mr. Bentley—I forget

his name. Mr. Bentley's room being all upset

with police and accountants and things, the

new manager has been using your office. And

I was in there to-day, and he was engaging a

young lady for the millinery, sir. He didn't

recognise her, not having been here long

enough, but I did. It was Miss Payne.'
'Impossible!'
'Yes, sir; Miss Payne—that is to say, Mrs.

Tudor. I heard him say, "Very well, you

can start to-morrow morning."'
'That's this morning?'
'Yes, sir.'
'Why didn't you tell me this last night?'

Hugo roared.
'It slipped my memory, sir,' said Simon,

surpassing all previous feats of insolence.
Hugo, speechless, waved him out of the

room.

CHAPTER XXIV
THE LODGING-HOUSE
The thought of soon seeing her intoxicated

him. His head swam, his heart leapt, his

limbs did what they liked, being forgotten.

And then, as he sobered himself, he tried

seriously to find an answer to this question:

Why had she returned, as it were surreptitiously,

to the very building from which her

funeral was supposed to have taken place?

Could she imagine that oblivion had covered

her adventure, and that the three thousand

five hundred would ignore the fact that she

was understood to be dead? He found no

answer—at least, no satisfactory answer—except

that women are women, and therefore

incalculable.
'Go and see if she is there,' he said to

Simon at five minutes to nine.
'She is there,' said Simon at five minutes

past nine; 'in one of the work-rooms alone.'
Then Hugo put a heavy curb on his instincts,

and came to a sudden resolve.
'Tell the new drapery manager,' he instructed

Simon, 'to give instructions to Mrs.

Tudor, or Miss Payne, whichever she calls

herself, that she is to meet him in my central

office at six o'clock this evening. He, however,

is not to be there. She is to wait in

the room alone, if I have not arrived. Inform

no one that I have returned from Paris. I

am now going out for the day.'
'Yes, sir.'
Hugo thereupon took train to Ealing. He

walked circuitously through the middle of

the day from Ealing to Harrow, alone with

his thoughts in the frosty landscape. From

Harrow he travelled by express to Euston,

reaching town at five-thirty. Somehow or

other the day had passed. He got to Sloane

Street at six, and ascended direct to his central

office.
Had his orders been executed? Would

she be waiting? As he hesitated outside

the door he was conscious that his whole

frame shook. He entered silently.
Yes, she was there. She sat on the edge

of a chair near the fire, staring at the fire.

She was dressed in the customary black.

Ah! it was the very face he had seen in the

coffin, the same marvellous and incomparable

features; not even sadder, not aged by a day;

the same!
She turned at the sound of the closing of

the door, and, upon seeing him, started

slightly. Then she rose, and delicately blushed.
'Good-evening, Mr. Hugo,' she said, in a

low, calm voice. 'I did not expect to see

you.'
Great poetical phrases should have rushed

to his lips—phrases meet for a tremendous

occasion. But they did not. He sighed.

'I can only say what comes into my head,'

he thought ruefully. And he said:
'Did I startle you?'
'Not much,' she replied. 'I knew I must

meet you one day or another soon. And it

is better at once.'
'Just so,' he said. 'It is better at once.

Sit down, please. I've been walking all day,

and I can scarcely stand.' And he dropped

into a chair. 'Do you know, dear lady,' he

proceeded, 'that Doctor Darcy and I have

been hunting for you all over Paris?'
He managed to get a little jocularity into

his tone, and this achievement eased his

attitude.
'No,' she said, 'I didn't know. I'm very

sorry.'
'But why didn't you let Darcy know that

you were coming to London?'
'Mr. Hugo,' she answered, with a charming

gesture, 'I will tell you.' And she got up

from her chair and came to another one

nearer his own. This delicious action filled

him with profound bliss. 'When I read in

the paper that Mr. Ravengar had committed

suicide, I had just enough money in my

pocket to pay my expenses to London, and

to keep me a few days here. And I did so

want to come! I did so want to come! I

came by the morning train. It was an inspiration.

I waited for nothing. I meant

to write to Mr. Darcy that same night, but

that same night I caught sight of him here

in Sloane Street, so I knew it was no use

writing just then. And I didn't care for him

to see me. I thought I would give him time

to return. As a matter of fact, I wrote

yesterday evening. He would get the letter

to-night. I hope my disappearance didn't

cause you any anxiety?'
'Anxiety!' He repeated the word. 'You

don't know what I've been through. I feared

that Ravengar, before killing himself, had

arranged to—to—I don't know what I feared.

Horrible, unmentionable things! You can't

guess what I've been through.'
'I, too, have suffered since we met last,'

said Camilla softly.
'Don't talk of it—don't talk of it!' he

entreated her. 'I know all. I saw your

image in a coffin. I have heard your late

husband's statement. And Darcy has told

me much. Let us forget all that, and let us

forget it for evermore. But you have to

remember, nevertheless, that in London you

have the reputation of being dead.'
'I have not forgotten,' she said, with a

beautiful inflection and a bending of the head,

'that I promised to thank you the next time

we met for what you did for me. Let me

thank you now. Tell me how I can thank

you!'
He wanted to cry out that she was divine,

and that she must do exactly what she liked

with him. And then he wanted to take her

and clasp her till she begged for her breath.

And he was tempted to inform her that though

she loved Darcy as man was never loved

before, still she should marry him, Hugo, or

Darcy should die.
'Sit down,' he said in a quiet, familiar voice.

'Don't bother about thanking me. Just tell

me all about the history of your relations with

Ravengar.' And to himself he said: 'She

shall talk to me, and I will listen, and we shall

begin to be intimate. This is the greatest

happiness I can have. Hang the future! I

will give way to my mood. Darcy said she

didn't want to leave Paris, but she has left it.

That's something.'
'I will do anything you want,' she answered

almost gaily; and she sat down again.
'I doubt it,' he smiled. 'However—'
The sense of intimacy, of nearness, gave him

acute pleasure, as at their first interview

months ago.
'I would like to tell you,' she began; 'and

there is no harm now. Where shall I start?

Well'—she became suddenly grave—'Mr.

Ravengar used to pass my father's shop in the

Edgware Road. He came in to buy things.

It was a milliner's shop, and so he could buy

nothing but bonnets and hats. He bought

bonnets and hats. I often served him. He

gave my father some very good hints about

shares, but my father never took them.

When my parents both died, Mr. Ravengar

was extremely sympathetic, and offered me a

situation in his office. I took it. I became

his secretary. He was always very polite

and considerate to me, except sometimes when

he got angry with everybody, including me.

He couldn't help being rude then. He had

an old clerk named Powitt, who sat in the

outer office, and seemed to do nothing.

Powitt had just brains enough to gamble,

and he gambled in the shares of Mr. Ravengar's

companies. I know he lost money,

because he used to confide in me and grumble

at Mr. Ravengar for not giving him proper

tips. Mr. Ravengar simply sneered at him—he

was very hard. Powitt had a younger

brother, who was engaged in another City

office, and this younger brother also gambled

in Ravengar shares, and also lost. The two

brothers gambled more and more, and old

Powitt once told me that Mr. Ravengar

misled them sometimes from sheer—what

shall I call it?'
'Devilry,' Hugo suggested. 'I can believe

it. That would be his idea of a good joke.'
'By-and-by I learnt that they were in

serious difficulties. Young Powitt was

married, but his wife left him—I believe he

had taken to drink. There was a glass partition

between my room and Mr. Ravengar's—ground

glass at the bottom, clear glass at the

top. One night, after hours, I went back to the

office for an umbrella which I had forgotten,

and I found young Powitt trying to open the

petty-cash-box in my room. He had not

succeeded, and I just told him to go, and that

I should forget I had seen him there. He

kissed my hand. And just then the outer

door of the office opened, and someone

entered. I turned off the light in my room.

Young Powitt crouched down. It was Mr.

Ravengar. He went to his own room. I

jumped on a chair, and looked through the

glass screen. Old Powitt was hanging by the

neck from the brass curtain-rod in Mr.

Ravengar's room. While young Powitt was

trying to get out of their difficulties by

thieving, old Powitt had taken a shorter way.

Mr. Ravengar looked at the body swinging

there, and I heard him say, "Ah!" Like

that!'
'Great heaven!' cried Hugo, 'you've been

through sufficient in your time!'
'Yes.' Camilla paused. 'Mr. Ravengar

cut down the body, searched the pockets, took

out a paper, read it, and put it in his own

pocket. Then the old man's lips twitched.

He was not quite dead, after all. Mr. Ravengar

stared at the face; and then, by means of

putting a chair on a table and lifting Powitt

on to the chair, he tied up the cord which he

had cut, and left the poor old man to

swing again. It was an—an interrupted

suicide.'
She stopped once more, and Hugo fervently

wished he had never asked her to begin. He

gazed at her set face with a fascinated glance.
'All this time,' she resumed, 'young Powitt

had been crouching on the floor, and had seen

nothing.'
'And what did you do?'
'I fainted, and fell off my chair. The noise

startled Mr. Ravengar, and he came round into

my room. Young Powitt met him at the

door, and, to explain his presence there, he

said that he had come to see his brother.

Mr. Ravengar said: "Your brother is in the

next room." But instead of going into the

next room, young Powitt ran off. Then Mr.

Ravengar perceived me on the floor. My

first words to him when I recovered consciousness

were: "Why did you hang him up again,

Mr. Ravengar?" He was staggered. He

actually tried to justify himself, and said it

was best for the old man—the old man had

wanted to die, and so on. Mr. Ravengar

certainly thought that young Powitt had seen

what I had seen. That very night young

Powitt was arrested for another theft, from

his own employers, and it was not till after

his arrest that he learnt that his brother had

committed suicide. He got four years. When

he received sentence, he swore that he would

kill Mr. Ravengar immediately he came out of

prison. I heard his threat. I knew him, and

I knew that he meant it. He argued that

Mr. Ravengar's financial operations had

ruined thousands of people, including his

brother and himself.
'But the inquest on old Powitt—I seem to

remember about it. Why didn't you give

evidence?'
'Because I was ill with brain-fever. When

I recovered, all was finished. What was I to

do? I warned Mr. Ravengar that young

Powitt meant to kill him. He laughed. Of

course, I left him. It is my belief that Mr.

Ravengar was always a little mad. If he was

not so before, this affair had strained his

intelligence too much.'
'You did a very wrong thing,' said Hugo,

'in keeping silence.'
'Put yourself in my place,' Camilla

answered. 'Think of all the facts. It was

all so queer, And—and—Mr. Ravengar had

found me in the room with young Powitt.

Suppose he had—'
'Say no more,' Hugo besought her. 'How

long is this ago?'
'Three years last June. In six months

young Powitt's sentence will be up.'
Hugo nearly leapt from his chair.
'Is it possible, Mrs. Tudor,' he asked her

eagerly, 'that you are not aware that in

actual practice a reasonably well-behaved

prisoner never serves the full period of his

sentence? Marks for good conduct are

allowed, and each mark means so many

days deducted from the term.'
'I didn't know,' said Camilla simply.

'How should I know a thing like that?'
'I have no doubt that young Powitt is

already free. And if he is—'
'You think that Mr. Ravengar's suicide

may not have been a suicide?'
Hugo hesitated.
'Yes,' he said, and lapsed into reflection.

'I shall see you home,' he said.
'I am going to walk,' she replied. 'And

I have to get my things from the cloak-room.'
'I will walk with you,' he said.
'What style the woman has!' he thought,

enraptured.
They proceeded southwards in silence.

Then suddenly she asked how he had left

Mr. Darcy, and they began to talk about

Darcy and Paris. Hugo encouraged her.

He wished to know the worst.
'Except my father,' she said, 'I have never

met anyone with more sense than Mr. Darcy,

or anyone more kind. I might have been

dead now if it hadn't been for Mr. Darcy.'
'Mr. Darcy is a very decent fellow,' Hugo

remarked experimentally.
She turned and gave him a look. No, it

was not a look; it was the merest fraction of

a look, but it withered him up.
'She loves him!' he thought. 'And what's

more, if she hadn't made up her mind to

marry him, she wouldn't be so precious easy

and facile and friendly with me. I might

have guessed that.'
They passed Victoria Station, and came

into Horseferry Road. She had informed

him that she had taken a furnished room in

Horseferry Road. The high and sinister

houses appeared unspeakably and disgracefully

mean to him in the wintry gloom of the

gaslights. She halted before a tenement that

seemed even more odious than its neighbours.

Was it possible that she should exist in such

a quarter? The idea sickened him.
'Which floor?' he questioned.
'Oh,' she laughed, 'the top, the fifth.

Good-night, Mr. Hugo.'
He pictured the mean and frowsy room,

and shuddered. Yet what could he do?

What right had he to interfere, to criticise,

to ameliorate?
'Good-night,' she repeated, and in a

moment she had opened the door with a latchkey

and disappeared. He stood staring at the

door. He had by no means finished saying

all that he meant to say to her. He must

talk to her further. He must show her that

he could not be dismissed in that summary

fashion. He mounted the two dirty steps,

and rang the bell in a determined manner.

He heard it tinkle distantly.
She was divine, adorable, marvellous, and

far beyond the deserts of any man; but she

had not shaken hands with him, and she had

treated him as she might have treated one of

the shopwalkers. Moreover, the question of

to-morrow had to be decided.
There was no answer to the bell, and he

rang again, with an increase of energy.
Then he perceived through the fanlight an

illumination in the hall. The door opened

cautiously, as such doors always do open, and

a middle-aged man in a dressing-gown stood

before him. In the background he descried

a small table with a candle on it, and the foul,

polished walls of the narrow lobby—a representative

London lodging-house.
'I want to see Mrs. Tudor,' said Hugo.
'Well, she ain't in at the moment,' replied

the man.
'Excuse me,' Hugo corrected him, 'I saw

her enter a minute ago with her latchkey.'
'No, you didn't,' the man persisted. 'I'm

the landlord of this house, and I've been in

my room at the back, and nobody's come in

this last half-hour, for I can see the 'all and

the stairs as I sits in my chair.'
'Wait a moment,' said Hugo; and he retreated

to the kerb, in the expectation of

being able to descry Camilla's light in the

fifth story.
'Oh, you can look,' the landlord observed

loftily, divining his intention; 'I warrant

there's no light there.'
And there was not.
'Perhaps you'll call again,' said the landlord

suavely.
'I suppose you haven't got a room to let?'

Hugo demanded, fumbling about in his brain

for a plan to meet this swift crisis.
'I can't tell you till my wife comes home.'
'And when will that be?'
'That'll be to-morrow.'
The door was banged to. Hugo rang again,

wrathfully, but the door remained obstinate.

CHAPTER XXV
CHLOROFORM
'Come in,' said Simon grandly, in response to

a knock.
He was seated in his master's chair in the

dome, which was lit as though for a fête.

The clock showed the hour of nine.
Albert entered.
'Oh, it's you, is it?' exclaimed Albert.

'Where's the governor?'
'I don't know where he is. He was in his

office at something to seven, having an interview

with Mrs. Tudor. Since then—'
Simon raised his eyebrows, and Albert

expressed a similar sentiment by means of a

whistle.
'Then, you've been telephoning on your

own for me to come up?'
'Yes.'
'It's like your cheek!' Albert complained,

calmly perching himself on the top of the

grand piano.
'Perhaps it will be. I regret to tear you

from your fireside, Alb, but I wish to consult

you on a matter affecting the governor.'
'Go ahead, then,' said Albert. 'There's

been enough talk about the governor to-day

downstairs, I should hope.'
'You mean in reference to Mrs. Tudor's

reappearance?'
'Yes.' Albert imitated Simon's carefully

enunciated periods. 'I do mean in reference

to Mrs. Tudor's reappearance. By the way,

what the deuce are you burning all these lights

for?'
'I was examining this photograph,' said

Simon, handing to his brother a rather large

unmounted silver-print photograph which had

lain on his knees.
'What of it?' Albert asked, glancing at it.

'Medical and Pharmaceutical Department,

isn't it? Not bad.'
'We're having a new series of full-plate

photographs done for the next edition of the

General Catalogue,' said Simon, 'and this is

one of them. It contains forty-five figures.

It was taken yesterday morning by that

Curgenven flashlight process that we're

running. Look at it. Don't you see anything?'
'Nothing special,' Albert admitted.
Simon rose and came towards the piano.
'Let me show you,' he said superiorly.

'You see the cash-desk to the left. There's

a lady just leaving the cash-desk. And just

behind her there's an oldish man. You can't

see all of his face because of her hat. He's

holding his bill in his hand—you can see the

corner of it—and he's got some sort of a parcel

under his arm. See?'
'Yes, Mr. Lecoq.'
'Well, doesn't he remind you of somebody?'
'He's rather like old Ravengar, perhaps,'

said Albert dubiously.
'You've hit it!' Simon almost shouted. 'It

is Ravengar.'
'This man's got no beard.'
'That comes well from a detective, that

does!' said Simon scornfully. 'It needn't

have cost him more than threepence to have

his beard shaved off, need it?'
'And seeing that this photograph was taken

yesterday morning, and Ravengar fell off a

steamer into the Channel more than a week

ago!'
'But did he fall off a steamer more than a

week ago?'
'He was noticed on board the steamer

before she started, and he wasn't on board

when she arrived.'
'Couldn't he have walked on to the steamer

with his luggage, and then walked off again

and let her start without him?'
'But why?'
'Suppose he wanted to pretend to be dead?'
'Why should he want to pretend to be

dead?' Albert defended his position.
Simon, entirely forgetful of that dignity

which usually he was at such pains to preserve,

sprang on to the piano alongside Albert.
'I'll tell you another thing,' said he.

'When I came in with the governor's tea

this morning he was just dozing and half-dreaming

like—he'd had a very bad night—and

I heard him say, "So they think you are

at the bottom of the Channel, Louis? I wish

you were!" What do you think of that, my

son?'
'Then the governor must know Ravengar

didn't commit suicide in the Channel? The

governor never said a word to me!'
'You don't imagine the governor tells you

everything, do you?' said Simon cruelly.
'Have you shown him the photo?' Albert

asked.
'No,' said Simon, with a certain bluntness.
'Why not?'
'Well, for one thing, I've had no chance,

and for another I wanted to find out something

more first. I'd just like the governor to see

that I'm not an absolute idiot.... Though

I should have thought he might have found

that out before now.'
'He doesn't think you're an absolute idiot,'

said Albert.
'He acts as if he did,' said Simon. The

Paris trip still rankled.
A pause followed.
'Another thing,' Albert recommenced.

'Even supposing Ravengar's alive, it's not

very likely he'd venture here, of all places.'
'Why not?' Simon argued. 'Scarcely anybody

knows Ravengar by sight. He's famous

for keeping himself to himself. He's one of

the least known celebrities in London. He'd

be safe from recognition almost anywhere.

Moreover, supposing he wanted to buy something

peculiar?'
'He might,' Albert admitted. 'But don't

forget this is all theory. I suppose you've

been making your own inquiries in the Medical

Department?'
'Yes,' said Simon rather apologetically.

'But I couldn't find anyone among the staff

who remembers serving such a man, or even

seeing him. He may have had an accomplice,

you know, on the staff. What makes it more

awkward is that there were two photographs

taken, one about eleven, and another about

half-past, and the photographer got the plates

mixed up, and doesn't know whether this one

is the first or the second. You see, the clock

doesn't show in the picture; otherwise, we

might have pieced things together.'
'Pity!' Albert murmured.
'However,' said Simon, with an obvious

intention to be dramatic, 'I thought of Lecoq,

and I hit on something. You see the lady

just leaving the cash-desk with her receipt?

Can you read the number of her receipt?'
Albert peered.
'No, I can't,' he said.
'Neither could I,' Simon agreed. 'But

I've had that part of the photograph enlarged

to-night.'
'The deuce you have!' Albert opened his

eyes.
'Yes, the deuce I have! And here it is.'
Simon took a photographic print from his

pocket, showing the lady's hand and part of

the receipt, very blurred and faint, with some

hieroglyphic figures mistily appearing.
'Looks like 6,706,' said Albert.
'It's either 6,706 or 6,766,' Simon concurred.

'Now, Ravengar's receipt must be

numbered next to hers. Consequently, if we

go and look at the counterfoils and duplicates—'
'Yes,' said Albert, thoughtfully sliding

down from the piano.
'We may be able to find out something very

interesting,' Simon finished, descending also.
'Now?'
'Now. That's what I wanted you for.

You've got your pass-keys and everything,

haven't you?'
'Yes.'
'Then run down and search.'
'Aren't you coming too?'
'I was only thinking, suppose the governor

came back and wanted me?'
Albert gazed contemptuously at this exhibition

of timidity—the cowardice of a

born valet, he deemed it.
'Oh, of course,' he exclaimed, 'if you—'
'I'll come,' said Simon boldly. 'If he

wants me he must wait, that's all.'
They descended together in Hugo's private

lift, direct from the dome; the Medical and

Pharmaceutical Department was on the

ground-floor. Simon acted as lift-man, and

slammed the grill when they emerged.
'Just open that again, Si,' Albert requested

him.
'Why? What's up?'
'Just open it.'
Albert was sniffing about like a dog that is

trying to decide whether there is not something

extremely attractive in the immediate

neighbourhood. He re-entered the lift, and

nosed it curiously.
Suddenly he bent down and peered under

the cushioned seat of the lift, and drew forth

an object that resembled in shape a canister

of disinfectant powder.
'Conf—!' he exclaimed, dropping it

sharply. 'It's hot. What in the name

of—'
He kicked the object out of the lift on to the

tessellated floor of a passage which led to the

Fish and Game Department.
'I bet you I can hold it,' said Simon

boastfully.
And, at the expense of his fingers, he picked

it up, and successfully carried it into the Fish

and Game Department, where a solitary light

(which burnt night and day) threw a dim

radiance over vast surfaces of white marble

dominated by silver taps. The fish and game

were below in the refrigerators. Simon let

the cylinder fall on to a slab; Albert turned a

tap, and immediately the cylinder was surrounded

by clouds of steam. The phenomenon

was like some alchemical and mysterious

operation. And the steam, as it rose and

spread abroad in the immense, pale interior,

might have been the fumes of a fatal philtre

distilled by a mediæval sorcerer.
'I hope it won't blow up!' Simon ejaculated.
'Not it!' said Albert. 'Let's have a look

at it now.'
Albert had a mechanical bent, and, with the

aid of a tool, he soon discovered that the

cylinder was divided into two parts. In the

lower part was burning charcoal. In the

upper, carefully closed, was paraffin. The

division between the two compartments consisted

of some sort of soldering lead, which

the heat of the charcoal had gradually been

melting.
'So when this stuff had melted,' he explained

to Simon, 'the paraffin would run

into the charcoal, and there would be a

magnificent flare-up.'
They looked at one another, amazed,

astounded, speechless.
And each knew that on the tip of the other's

tongue, unuttered, was the word 'Ravengar.'
'But why was it put in the lift?' asked

Simon.
'Because,' said Albert promptly, 'a lift-well

is the finest possible place for a fire.

There's a natural draught, and a free chance

for every floor. Poof! And a flame's up

nine stories in no time. And a really good

mahogany lift would burn gorgeously, and

give everything a good start.'
'There are fifteen lifts in this place,' Simon

muttered.
'I know,' said Albert.
He approached a little glass square in the

wall, broke it, pulled a knob, and looked at his

watch.
'We'll test the Fire Brigade Department,' he

remarked; and then, as he heard a man

running down the adjacent corridor, 'Seven

seconds. Not bad.'
In another seven minutes nine cylinders,

which had been found in nine different lifts,

were sizzling beside Albert's original discovery.

The other five lifts appeared to have been

omitted from this colossal scheme for providing

London with a pyrotechnic display

such as London had probably never had since

the year 1666. The night fire staff, which

consisted of some fifty men, had laid hose on

to every hydrant, and were taking instructions

from their chief for the incessant patrol of the

galleries.
'See here,' said Albert, 'we'd better go on

with what we started of now.'
'Had we?' Simon questioned somewhat

dubiously.
'Of course,' said Albert. 'If that is

Ravengar in the photo, and if we can find out

anything to-night, and if Ravengar's in this

business'—he jerked his elbow towards the

cylinders—'we shall be so much to the good.

Besides, it won't take us a minute.'
So they went forward, through twilit

chambers and passages filled with sheeted

objects, past miles of counters inhabited by

thousands of chairs, through doors whose

openings resounded strangely in the vast

nocturnal silence of Hugo's, till they came

to the Medical and Pharmaceutical Department.

And the Medical and Pharmaceutical

Department, in its night-garb, and illuminated

by a single jet at either end of it, seemed to

take on a kind of ghostly and scented elegance;

it seemed to be a lunar palace of bizarre

perfumes and crystal magics.
The two young men halted, and listened,

and they could catch the distant footfall of

the patrols echoing in some far-off corridor.

That reassured them. They ceased to fancy

the smell of burning and to be victimized by

the illusion that a little tongue of flame darted

out behind them.
Albert gained access to the accountant's

cupboard, and pulled out a number of books,

over which they pored side by side.
'Here you are!' exclaimed Simon presently.

'Receipts. January 9.'
And Albert read: 'No. 6,766, Mrs. Poidevin,

37, Prince's Gate; vinolia. No. 6,767,

Dr. Woolrich, 23, Horseferry Road; chloroform!

Can't make out the quantity, but it

must be a lot, I should think; the price is

eighteen and ninepence.'
'Dr. Woolrich, 23, Horseferry Road?'

Simon repeated mechanically. 'Chloroform?'
'That's it,' said Albert. 'You may bet

your boots. Let's look him up in the Medical

Directory, if they've got one here. Yes,

they're sure to have one.'
But there was no Dr. Woolrich in the

Medical Directory.
Once more the brothers stared at each other.

Was or was not Ravengar alive? Were they

or were they not on his track?
'Listen, Si,' said Albert. 'I'll drive right

down to 23, Horseferry Road, and have a look

round. Eh? What do you say?'
'I think I'll come, too,' Simon replied.
In six minutes Albert pulled up the hansom

at the end of the street, and they walked

slowly towards No. 23, but on the opposite

side of the road.
'That's it,' said Simon, pointing. 'What

are you going to do now? Inquire there?'
At the same moment a window opened

behind them, in the house immediately facing

No. 23; they both heard a hissing sound,

evidently designed to attract their attention,

and they both turned their heads.
From a first-story window Hugo was gesticulating

at them.

CHAPTER XXVI
SECOND TRIUMPH OF SIMON
'Come up at once,' Hugo whispered. 'Door

opposite top of stairs.'
And he threw down on to the pavement a

latchkey.
'What do you think of yourself now, Si?'

Albert asked his brother, as they entered the

house. 'You've let yourself in for something

at last.'
They found Hugo in an ordinary bedsitting-room.

He was wearing his hat and

his overcoat, and staring out of the open

window. It was a cold night, but he did not

seem to feel the icy draught which blew into

the apartment. The whole of his attention

appeared to be concentrated on No. 23. He

did not at first even turn to look at the

brothers when they came in. They explained

themselves.
'I will tell you why I am here, and what has

occurred to me,' said Hugo, playing, perhaps

rather nervously, with the knife and cheese-plate

which still lay on the small table by

the window. 'Then we can decide what to

do. I've hired this room.'
No doubt existed in his mind that Simon

had happened upon the track of the veritable

living Ravengar. It could not be a coincidence

that a man so strongly resembling

Ravengar, a man posing as a doctor, and

buying nearly a sovereign's worth of chloroform,

should be occupying rooms in the same

house as Camilla. The tremendous revelation

of Ravengar's genius for stratagem and intrigue

afforded by the recital of the two

brothers came upon Hugo with a dazing shock.

This man, whom he knew from Camilla's own

story to be curiously deficient in ordinary

human sentiments, had arranged a sham

suicide for the benefit of the general public.

He had let Hugo into the secret of that deception,

but only to cheat him with another

deception, and a more monstrous one. The

brain that could conceive the fiction of suicide

in the vault—a fiction which, while lulling

Hugo into a false security as regards Camilla's

safety, at the same time poisoned his happiness—such

a brain might be capable of unimagined

horrors. Sane or mad, the mere

existence of that brain was a menace before

which Hugo trembled. He realized that

Ravengar had been consummately acting

during the latter part of their interview on

the first day of the sale, and again consummately

acting when he spoke to Hugo on the

telephone. Ravengar had, beyond doubt, deliberately

set himself to lure Camilla back to

England, and he had succeeded. Beyond

doubt, all her movements had been spied and

marked, and Ravengar had been in a position

to complete his arrangements—whatever his

arrangements were—at leisure and with absolute

freedom. She had taken a room in

Horseferry Road, and he had followed.... What

was the sequel to be?
That she was in his power at that moment

Hugo could not question.
And the chloroform?
At that moment Ravengar had meant that

the Hugo building should have been a funeral

pyre—a spectacle to petrify the Metropolis.

And it seemed to Hugo that if Ravengar was

mad, as he must be, he could only have designed

the spectacle as something final, as at

once a last revenge and an accompaniment

to the supreme sacrifice of Camilla.
'We must get into that house immediately,'

said Hugo, when he had finished his own

narrative. 'The question is how?'
'I've got a card of Inspector Wilbraham's,

of the Yard, in my pocket,' Albert suggested.

'We might use that, and make out that this

purchase of chloroform under a false name

had got to be explained to the Yard instantly.'
Albert had recently become rather intimate

with Scotland Yard. Inspector Wilbraham

had even called on him in reference to

Bentley's death and the disappearance of

Brown; and Albert was duly proud.
'We will try that,' said Hugo. 'Have you

any handcuffs?'
'No, sir.'
'Go and obtain a couple of pairs. You

can be back in twenty minutes. Bring also

my revolver.'
Hugo and Simon were left alone. Hugo

spoke no word.
'I'll put the room to rights, sir,' said Simon,

after a pause. He could bear the inaction no

longer.
Hugo nodded absently, and Simon collected

the ruins of the vile repast which his master

had consumed, and put them outside on a

tray on the landing.
'There's a light now in the first story!'

exclaimed Hugo. 'I hope that boy won't

be long.'
And then Albert arrived with the revolver

and the handcuffs. He had been supernaturally

quick.
They descended and crossed the road.
'You understand,' Hugo instructed them.

'Let us have no mistake about getting in.

Immediately the door is opened, in we all go.

We can talk inside.'
'Supposing Albert and me went down to the

area-door,' Simon ventured, 'instead of the

front-door. We might get in easier that

way. It's always easier to deal with servant-girls

and persons of that sort in kitchens.

Then we could come upstairs and let you

in at the front-door. Three detectives seem

rather a lot to be entering all at once.

And, besides, you don't look like a detective,

sir.'
'What do I look like?' Hugo asked

coldly.
'You look too much like a gentleman, sir.

It's the hat, sir,' he added.
Simon had certainly surpassed himself that

day. He had begun by surpassing himself at

early morning, and he had kept it up. Probably

never before in his life had he been so

loquacious and so happy in his loquacity.
'That's not a bad scheme, Simon,' said

Hugo. 'Try it.'
The brothers went down the area-steps

while Hugo remained at the gate. A light

burned steadily in the first-floor window.

And then another and a fainter light flickered

in the hall, and after a few seconds the front-door

opened. Hugo literally jumped into the

house, and, safely within, he banged the door.
'Now,' he said.
A middle-aged woman, holding a candle,

stood by Simon and Albert in the hall.
'Are you the servant?' Hugo demanded.
'No, sir; I'm the landlady. And I'd like

to know—'
'Your husband told me you were away

and wouldn't return till to-morrow.'
'Seeing as how my husband's been dead

these thirteen years—'
'We're in, sir. We'd better search the

house to start with,' said Albert. 'There's

three of us. The man that opened the door to

you must have been a wrong un, one of his.'
'Never have I had the police in my house

before,' wailed the landlady of No. 23, Horseferry

Road, while the candle dropped

tallow tears on the oilcloth. 'And all I can

say is I thank the blessed Lord it's dark, and

you aren't in uniform. Doctor Woolrich's

rooms are on the first floor, and you can go up

and see for yourself, if you like. And how

should I know he wasn't a real doctor?'
As the landlady spoke, sounds of footsteps

made themselves heard overhead, and a door

closed.
'Give me that candle, my good woman,'

said Hugo, hastily snatching it from her.
The three men ran upstairs, leaving the hall

to darkness and the landlady.
Whether Hugo dropped the candle in his

excitement, or whether it was knocked out of

his hand by means of a stick through the rails

of the landing-banister as he ascended, will

never be accurately known. He himself is

not sure. The important fact is that the

candle fell, and the trio stumbled up the last

few stairs with nothing to guide them but a

chink of light through a half-closed door.

This door led to the rooms of Dr. Woolrich,

and the rooms of Dr. Woolrich were well

lighted with gas. But they were empty.

There was a sitting-room and a bedroom, and

on the round table in the centre of the sitting-room

was a copy of the most modern edition

of Quain's 'Dictionary of Medicine,' edited by

Murray, Harold, and Bosanquet, bound in

half-morocco; the volume was open at the

article 'Anæsthetics,' and Hugo will always

remember that the page was sixty-two. No

sooner were the rooms found to be empty

than Hugo rushed back to the landing, followed

by Simon. The landing, however, even

with the sitting-room door thrown wide and

the light streaming across the landing and

down the stairs, showed no sign of life.
Then Albert, who had remained within the

suite, called out:
'There must be a dressing-room off this

bedroom, and it's locked.'
'Simon,' said Hugo, 'go to the front window

and keep watch.'
And Hugo ran into the bedroom to Albert.
Decidedly there was a door in the bedroom

which had the appearance of leading into a

further room, but the door would not budge.

The pair glanced about. No evidence of

recent human habitation was visible either in

the sitting-room or in the bedroom, save only

the dictionary, and Albert commented on this.
'We must force that door,' Hugo decided,

'and be ready to look after yourself when it

gives way.'
As he spoke he could see, in the tail of his

eye, Simon opening the front window and

then looking out into the street.
'One—two—charge!' cried Hugo; and he

and Albert flung themselves valiantly against

the door.
They made no impression upon it at all.
Breathless and shaken, they looked at each

other.
'Suppose I fire into the lock?' said Hugo.
'We might try a key first,' Albert answered.
He took the key from the door between the

bedroom and the sitting-room, and applied

it to the lock of the obstinate portal. The

obstinate portal opened at once.
'Empty!' ejaculated Albert, putting his

nose into a small dressing-room.
With a gesture of disgust Hugo turned

away. In the same instant Simon withdrew

his head into the sitting-room.
'I've seen him,' Simon whispered in hoarse

excitement. 'He just popped out of the

kitchen and came half-way up the area steps.

Then he ran back. He saw me looking at

him.'
'Ravengar?'
Simon nodded. This was the hour of

Simon's triumph, the proof that he had not

been mistaken in the theory which he had

raised on the foundation of the photograph.
'Come along,' said Hugo grimly, preparing

to rush downstairs.
But a singular thing had occurred. While

Simon had been staring out of the front

window, and Hugo and Albert engaged in

forcing a door which led to emptiness, the

door of the sitting-room, the sole means of

egress from the first-floor suite, had been

shut and locked on the outside.
In vain Hugo assailed it with boot and

shoulder; in vain Albert assisted him.
'Keep your eye on the street, you fool!'

said Albert to Simon, when the latter offered

to join the siege of the door.
Hugo and Albert multiplied their efforts.
'There's a cab driven up,' Simon informed

them from the window. 'A man's got out.

Now he's gone down the area steps. They're

carrying something up, something big. Oh!

look here, I must help you.'
And Simon ran to the door. Before the

triple assault it fell at last, and the three

tumbled pell-mell downstairs into the hall.

The front-door was open.
A cab was just driving away. It drove

rapidly, very rapidly.
'After it!' Hugo commanded.
The hunt was up.
Two minutes afterwards another cab drove

up to the door.
Ravengar and another man emerged from

the area holding between them the form of a

woman. They got leisurely into the cab with

the woman and departed.

CHAPTER XXVII
THE CEMETERY
Both Simon and Albert easily outran Hugo,

and, fast as the first cab was travelling, they

had gained on it by the time it turned into

Victoria Street. And at the turning an incident

happened. The driver, though hurried,

was apparently to a certain extent careful

and cautious, but he did not altogether avoid

contact with a policeman at the corner. The

policeman was obliged to step sharply out of

the way of the cab, and even then the sleeve

of his immaculate tunic was soiled by contact

with the hind-wheel of the vehicle. Now, the

driver might have scraped an ordinary person

with impunity, and passed on unchallenged;

he might even have soiled the sleeve of a

veteran policeman and got nothing worse

than a sharp word of censure and a fragment

of good advice. But this particular policeman

was quite a new policeman, whose dignity

was as delicate and easily smirched as his

beautiful shining tunic. And the result was

that the cabby had to stop, give his number,

and listen to a lecture.
Simon and Albert formed part of the

audience for the lecture. It did not, however,

interest them, for they had instantly

perceived that the cab was empty.
Then, as the lecturer was growing eloquent,

Hugo arrived, and was informed of the emptiness

of the vehicle.
'It was just a trick,' Simon exclaimed; 'a

trick to get us out of the house.'
'We must go back,' said Hugo, breathless.
At this moment the second cab appeared,

was delayed a moment by the multitude

listening to the lecture, and passed westwards

into Victoria Street.
'They're in that!' cried Simon.
'Are you sure?' Hugo questioned.
'Of course I'm sure,' said Simon, who in

the excitement of the trail had ceased to be

a valet.
To jump into a hansom and order the driver

to keep the four-wheeler in sight ought to

have been the work of a few seconds, but it

occurred, as invariably occurs when a hansom

is urgently needed, that no hansom was available.

The four-wheeler was receding at a

moderate rate in the direction of the Grosvenor

Hotel.
'Run after it!' said Hugo. 'I'll get a cab

in the station-yard and follow.'
The quarry vanished round a corner just

as they tumbled into the hansom on the top

of Hugo, but it was never out of observation

for more than a quarter of a minute. Through

divers strange streets it came at length into

Fulham Road at Elm Place, and thenceforward,

at a higher rate of speed, it kept to the

main thoroughfare. The procession passed

the workhouse and the Redcliffe Arms. Between

Edith Grove and Stamford Bridge the

roadway was up for fundamental repairs, and

omnibuses were being diverted down Edith

Grove to King's Road. A policeman at the

corner spoke to the driver of the four-wheeler,

gave a sign of assent, and the four-wheeler

went straight onwards into a medley of wood-blocks,

which was all that was left of Fulham

Road. The hansom followed intrepidly, and

then its three occupants were conscious of a

sudden halt.
'Bobby wants to know where you're

going to,' said the driver, opening the

trap.
There was a slight hesitation, and the policeman's

voice could be heard:
'Come out of it!'
'We're following that four-wheeler,' Hugo

was about to say, but he perceived the absurdity

of saying such a thing in cold blood

to a policeman.
All three descended. The cabman had to

be paid. There was a difficulty about finding

change—one of those silly and ridiculous difficulties

that so frequently supervene in crises

otherwise grave; in short, a succession of

trifling delays, each of which might easily

have been obviated by perfect forethought,

or by perfect accord between the three men.
When next they came to close quarters

with the four-wheeler it was leisurely driving

away empty from a small semi-detached

house which was separated from the road

by a tiny garden. They ran into the garden.

The one thing that flourished in it was a 'To

Let' notice. The front-door, shaded by unpruned

trees, was shut, and there were cobwebs

on the handle, as Hugo plainly saw

when he struck a match. They hastened

round to the back of the house, where was a

larger garden. A French window gave access

to the house. This French window yielded

at once to a firm push. The three men

searched the ground-floor and found nothing.

They then ascended the stairs and equally

found nothing. The house must have been

empty for many months. From the first-floor

window at the back Hugo gazed out,

baffled. Far off he could see lights of houses,

but the foreground was all darkness and

mystery.
'What lies between us and those lights?'

he asked.
'It must be Brompton Cemetery, sir,' said

Albert. 'The garden gives on the cemetery,

I expect.'
As if suddenly possessed by a demon, Hugo

flew out of the room, down the stairs, into the

garden. At the extremity of the garden was

a brick wall, and against the wall were two

extremely convenient barrels; they might

have been placed there specially for the occasion.

In an instant he was in the cemetery.

The remainder of the adventure survives

in Hugo's memory like a sort of night-picture

in which all the minor details of life are lost

in large, vague glooms, and only the central

figures of the composition emerge clearly, in

a sharp and striking brilliance, against the

mysterious background.
He knew himself in the cemetery, and immediately,

by a tremendous effort of the brain,

he had arranged his knowledge of the place

and decided exactly where he was. Instinctively

he ran by side-alleys till he came to

the broad central way which cuts this vast

field of the dead north and south. He hurried

northwards, and when he had gone about a

hundred and fifty yards he turned to the left,

and then went north again.
'It's here,' he muttered.
He was in the middle of that strange and

sinister city within a city, that flat expanse

of silence, decay, and putrefaction which is

surrounded on every side by the pulsating

arteries of London. The living visit the dead

during the day, but at night the dead are left

to themselves, and the very flowers which

embroider their dissolution close up and forget

them. Round about him everywhere trees

and shrubs moved restlessly and plaintively

in the night breeze; the angular grave-stones

raised their kindly lies in the darkness. A

few stars flickered in the sky; no moon. And

miles off, so it seemed, north, south, east, and

west, the yellow lights of human habitations,

the lights of warm rooms where living people

were so engaged in the business of being alive

that they actually forgot death—these lights

winked to each other across the waste and

desolation of a hundred thousand tombs.
With the certainty of a blind man, the

assurance of a seer who has divined what the

future holds, he approached the vault. He

was aware that the little gate in the railing

would be open. It was. He was aware that

the iron door in the side of the vault would

be unlocked. It was. He pushed it and

entered. All difficulties and hindrances had

been removed. No odour of death greeted

his nostrils, unless the strong smell of chloroform

can be called the odour of death. He

struck a match. The first thing he saw was

a candle and a screwdriver, and then the

match blew out. The door of the vault was

ajar, and he would not close it. He dared

not. He struck another match and put it

to the candle, and the vault was full of

jumping shadows. And he looked and looked

again. Yes, down in that corner she lay,

motionless, lifeless, done with for ever and

ever. Only her face was visible. The rest

of her seemed to be covered with a man's

overcoat, flung hastily down. He stared,

enchanted by the horror. What was that

white stuff round her head? Part of it

seemed to be torn, and a strip fluttered across

her closed eyelids. He went nearer. He

touched—cold! Could she be so soon cold?

And then the truth swept over him, and

almost swept his senses away, that this

image in the corner was not she, but merely

that waxen thing made by the sculptor in

Paris, that counterfeit which had deceived

him in the drawing-room of the flat.
Then where was she? And why was not

this counterfeit in its coffin, in which it had

been buried with all the rites of the Church?

The coffin? Yes, the coffin was there at his

feet, with its brass plate, which had rusted

at the corners; and below it, in some undefined

depth, was another coffin, the sarcophagus

of Tudor himself. He stooped and

shifted the candle. On Camilla's coffin were

a number of screws, rolled about in various

directions; only one screw was in its place.

He seized the screwdriver—and in that

moment a tiny part of his intelligence found

leisure to decide that this screwdriver was

slightly longer than the one he had used

aforetime for a similar purpose—and he unscrewed

the solitary screw and raised the lid

of the coffin, letting all the screws roll off it

with a great rattle.... An overwhelming

rush of chloroform vapour escaped.... She

lay within, dressed in her black dress, and

her dress had been crammed into the coffin

hastily, madly, and was thrust down in thick,

disorderly folds about her feet, and her hair

half covered her face. And her face was

slightly flushed, and her eyelids quivered,

and the cheeks were warm. He put his

hands under her armpits and wrenched her

out and carried her from the vault. And

then he sank to the ground sobbing.
What caused him to sob? If any man

dared now to ask him, and if he dared to

answer, he might reply that it was not grief

nor joy, nor the reaction from an intolerable

strain, but simply the idea of the terrific and

heart-breaking cruelty of Ravengar which had

dragged from him a sob.
The path followed by the madman's brain

was easy to pursue once the clue found. He

had been cheated into the belief that Camilla's

body rested in that coffin, and when he had

discovered that it did not rest there he had

determined that the mistake should be rectified,

the false made true. That had seemed

to him logical and just. She was supposed

to be in the coffin; she should really be in the

coffin; she should be forced and jammed into

it. And his lunatic and inhuman fancy had

added even to that conception. She should

be drugged and carried to the vault, and

drugged again, and then immured, unconscious,

but alive; and if by chance she awoke

from the chloroform sleep after he had finished

screwing in the screws, so much the better!

So it was that his mind had worked. And the

scheme had been executed with that courage,

that calmness, that audacity, that minute

attention to detail, of which only madmen at

their maddest appear to be capable. Beyond

any question the scheme would have succeeded

had not Hugo, the moment Albert Shawn

uttered the word 'cemetery,' perceived the

general trend of it in a single wondrous flash

of intuition. He had guessed it, and even

while afraid to believe that he was right, had

known absolutely and convincingly that he

was right.
Camilla murmured some phrase, and gave

a sigh as she lay on the gravelled path.
She had recovered from the fatal torpor in

the cool night air. He said nothing, because

he felt that he could do nothing else. Albert

and Simon were certainly looking for him in

the maze of the cemetery; they would find

him soon. It did not seem to him extraordinary

that he had left them in that sudden,

swift fashion without a word.
Then he heard, or thought he heard, a

noise in the vault, and, summoning all his

strength of will, he descended the steps again

and glanced within. Ravengar was there.

Had he been there all the time, hidden behind

the door? Or had he fled and stealthily returned?

Only Ravengar could say. He had

taken up the image from the corner and was

replacing it in the coffin. It was as if he had

bowed his obstinate purpose to some higher

power which was inscrutable to him. Children

and madmen can practise this singular and

surprising fatalism. Disturbed, he raised his

head and caught sight of Hugo. They gazed

at one another by the flickering candle.
'Where's the man who helped you?' Hugo

demanded faintly.
He had not much heart, much force, much

firmness left. Ravengar's eyes, at once empty

and significant, blank and yet formidable,

startled him. He had the revolver and the

handcuffs in his pocket, but he could not have

used them. Ravengar's eyes, so fiendish and

so ineffably sad, melted his spine. Ravengar

stepped forward and Hugo stepped

back.
'Let me pass,' said Ravengar, in the tone

of one who has suffered much and does not

mean to suffer much more.
And Hugo let him pass, inexplicably,

weakly; and at the end of a narrow path he

merged into the vague, general darkness.

And then Hugo heard the sound of a struggle,

and the voices of Simon and Albert—young

and boisterous and earthly and sane. And

then scampering footfalls which died away in

the uttermost parts of the cemetery.
And Camilla sat up, rubbing her eyes.
'It's all right,' he soothed her.

CHAPTER XXVIII
BEAUTY
'Hum! he's going to marry her,' Simon had

said, and Albert had said, and Lily had said.

'I knew it all along.' When, at the end of six

months, Hugo went away, much furnishing

of rooms near the Dome took place by his

orders during his absence.
Yet here was Hugo back at the end of the

fortnight, radiant certainly, but alone.
'There was one little matter I forgot,' Hugo

began, rather timidly, as Simon thought, when

assured that everything was in order.
'Yes, sir?' said Simon.
'I want you to be good enough to give up

your room.'
'My room, sir?'
'To oblige a lady.'
'A lady, sir?'
'I should say a lady's lady.'
Simon paused. He was wounded, but he

would not show it.
'With pleasure, sir.'
'To-night,' Hugo proceeded, 'you can

occupy my bed in the dome;' and he pointed

to the spot where, during the day, the bed lay

ingeniously hidden in a recess of the wall. 'I

shall no longer need it. To-morrow we can

make some more permanent arrangement for

you.'
'Yes, sir.'
'Also,' Hugo continued, 'I would like you

to go along to the offices of the Morning Post

for me some time to-night before ten o'clock

and take this. There will be a guinea to pay.'

Hugo handed him a slip of paper.
'Yes, sir.'
'Read it,' said Hugo.
And Simon read: '"A marriage has been

arranged, and"—and—has taken place, sir?'
'Precisely.'
'Precisely, sir. "Has taken place at Hythe

between Mr. Owen Hugo, of Sloane Street,

London, and Mrs. Camilla Tudor, widow of

the late Mr. Francis Tudor."'
'You are the first to know, Simon.'
Simon bowed.
'May I respectfully venture to wish you

every happiness, sir?' Simon pronounced at

his most formal.
'No, you may not,' said Hugo. 'But you

may shake hands with me.'
And he respectfully ventured to explain to

Simon how, in the case of a man like himself,

with three thousand five hundred tongues

ever ready to wag about him, absolute secrecy

had been the only policy.
'Telephone down to the refreshment department

for Tortoni to come up to me

instantly. I must order a dinner for two. My

wife and her maid will be here in half an hour.

I shall not want you—at any rate, before ten-thirty

or so.'
'Yes, sir. And the maid?'
'What about the maid?'
'You said you would order dinner for two, sir.'
'Look here, Simon,' said Hugo. 'If you

will take the maid down to dine in the Central

Restaurant and keep her there—take her

with you for a drive to the Morning Post—I

shall regard it as a favour. Catch!' And

he threw to Simon the gold token, which made

Simon master of all the good things in the

entire building. 'Make use of that.'
Simon felt a little nervous at the prospect.

He had not seen the maid. However, he

hoped for the best, and assured Hugo of his

delight.
'I forgot to inform you, sir,' he turned back

to tell Hugo as he was leaving the room,

'Doctor Darcy called again to-day. He has

called several times the last few days. He

said he might look in again to-night.'
The bridegroom started.
'If he should,' Hugo ordered, 'don't say

I'm in till you've warned me.'
'Yes, sir.'
Three hours later the bride and bridegroom

were finishing one of the distinguished Tortoni's

most elaborate dinners. Tortoni had

protested that it was destructive of the elementary

principles of art to order a dinner for

eight-thirty at seven o'clock. However, he

had not completely failed. The waiters had

departed, and Camilla, in dazzling ivory-white,

was pouring out coffee. Hugo was cutting a

cigar. They did not speak; they felt. They

were at the end of the brief honeymoon, and

the day was at an end. The last remnants of

twilight had vanished, and through the eastern

windows of the dome the moon was rising.

Neither the hour nor the occasion made for

talkativeness. Life lay before Hugo and

Camilla. Both were honestly convinced that

they had not lived till that hour—that hour

whence dated the commencement of their

regular united existence. They looked at each

other, satisfied, admiring, happy, expecting

glorious things from Fate.
There was a discreet alarm at the door.

Simon came in. It would have been a gross

solecism to knock, but Simon performed the

equivalent. He paused, struck when he beheld

Camilla, as well he might; for Camilla

was such a vision as is not often vouchsafed

to the Simons of this world. She was peerless

that evening. And she smiled charmingly on

him, and asked after his health.
'Your coffee, dearest,' she murmured to

Hugo.
It occurred to Simon that the dome would

never be the same again. This miraculous

and amazing creature was going to be always

there, to form part of his daily life, to swish

her wonderful skirts in and out of the

rooms, to—to—He did not know

whether to be glad or sorry. He knew only

that he was perturbed, thrown off his balance,

so much so that he forgot to explain his

invasion.
'Well, Simon,' said Hugo, 'had your dinner

and been to the Morning Post office?'
'Yes, sir.'
'Alone?'
Simon blushed.
'No, sir.'
'Good.'
'Doctor Darcy is here, sir. Are you at

home?'
Hugo had utterly forgotten about Doctor

Darcy. He glanced at his wife interrogatively,

but Camilla looked at the moon

through the window.
'Show Doctor Darcy in in five minutes,'

said Hugo.
'Poor old Darcy!' exclaimed Camilla when

they were alone. 'Does he know?'
'Know what? That we are married?

No. I wrote to him nearly six months ago

to tell him that you were safe and all that,

and he acknowledged the letter on a postcard.

Afterwards I sent him that trifle of money

that you owed him, and he sent a stamped

receipt.'
'He always hides his feelings,' said Camilla.

'This will be a blow for him!'
'How?'
'Didn't he tell you he was most violently

in love with me in Paris?'
'He did not,' said Hugo. 'Did he tell you?'
'No, of course not. He was far too

chivalrous for that. It would have seemed

like taking advantage of my situation to

force me into a marriage.'
'How do you know he was violently in love

with you, bright star?' Hugo demanded in

that amiably malicious tone which he could

never withstand the temptation to employ.
'My precious boy,' replied Camilla, 'how

does a woman know these things?'
And she came over and kissed Hugo.
'You shall talk to him first,' she said. 'I'll

join you later.'
'Did he ever commit sublime follies for

you,' Hugo asked, detaining her hand, 'as I

did when I shut up the entire place because

I thought you looked exhausted one hot

morning?'
She bent over him.
'Darcy is incapable of any folly in regard

to women,' she said. 'That is one reason why

we should never have suited each other, he

and I. A fool should always marry a fool.

Consider my folly when I came back to work

in your Department 42 simply because I

could not forget your masterful face. Wasn't

that also sublime?'
'You never told me—'
'But you guessed.'
'Perhaps.'
She withdrew her hand, and then that delicious

swish of skirts which Simon's imagination

had foretold thrilled Hugo with delight.

He launched a kiss towards her as she

vanished.
'We are all to be heartily congratulated,'

said Darcy, somewhat astonished when Hugo

had put him abreast of the times. 'At one

period I suspected that you were going to

make a match of it, and then, as I heard

nothing, I began to be afraid that she had

been unable to banish my humble self from

her mind. And, to tell you the truth, the

object of this present visit to London was to

inform myself, and, if necessary, to—offer her—See?'
Hugo was bound to admit that he saw.

Inwardly he laughed to think that he had

been seriously disturbed by Darcy's statement

in regard to the condition of Camilla's

heart.
'Shall we go out to the top of the dome?'

he suggested.
They rose.
And at that juncture Camilla reappeared.
The greeting between the Paris friends was

commendably calm, but neither seemed to be

able to speak freely. And at length Camilla

said she would get a cloak and follow them to

the belvidere.
The two men climbed to the summit which

dominated the City of Pleasure. To the east

the famous roof restaurant glittered and

jingled under the moon. To the west the

Great Wheel was outlined in flame—a symbol

of the era. Hugo told Darcy the history of the

night in the cemetery, and what preceded,

and what came after it, including the strange

death of Ravengar in a lunatic asylum, and

how everything was explained or explicable—even

Mr. Brown, the manager of the Safe

Deposit, had run up against justice in Caracas—save

and except the identity of Ravengar's

accomplice during the last days. He was

enlarging upon the inscrutability of that part

of the affair, and upon the interest which it

lent to the whole episode, when Darcy, who

had not been listening, broke in upon his

observation with an inapposite remark which

obviously sprang from deep feeling.
'She's simply marvellous!' cried Darcy.
'Who?'
'Your wife. Simply marvellous! I had

no idea—in Paris—'
'Recollect, you are not in love with her,

my friend,' Hugo laughed.
'She must have the best blood in her veins.

With that style, that carriage, she surely must

be—'
'My dear fellow,' said Hugo, 'beauty has

no rank. It bloweth where it listeth. It is

the one thing in the world that you can't

account for. You've only got to be thankful

for it when it blows your way, that's all.'
A white figure appeared in the cavity of the

steps leading to the circular gallery.
'What are you talking about?' Camilla

inquired.
'Women,' said Hugo.
