    PREFACE.


The only merit that the writer claims for the following pages is, that

they contain a record of facts, setting forth the sacred sentiments of

duty, religious trust, and the spirit of liberty, amid sufferings-and

hardships of persons, whose loyalty was put to the severest test.


It has been beautifully said, "that he who sets a colony on foot designs

a great work." "He designs all the good, and all the glory, of which, in

the series of ages, it might be the means; and he shall be judged more

by the lofty, ultimate aim and result, than by the actual instant

motive. You may well admire, therefore, the solemn and adorned

plausibilities of the colonizing of Rome from Troy, in the Eneid! Though

the leader had been burned out of house and home, and could not choose

but go. You may find in the flight of the female founder of the gloomy

greatness of Carthage a certain epic interest; yet was she running from

the madness of her husband to save her life. Emigration from our stocked

communities of undeified men and women, emigration for conquest, for

gold, for very restlessness of spirit, if they grow toward an imperial

issue, have all thus a prescriptive and recognized ingredient of

heroism. But when the immediate motive is as grand as the ultimate hope

was lofty, and the ultimate success splendid, then, to use an expression

of Bacon's," "the music is fuller."


In the hope that the privations and heroic conduct of those who are the

subjects of the story, in the following chapters, may prove as

interesting to the public as they did to the writer, when he first

learned the history of such heroism, the writer submits them to the

reader.

    INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER


The records of the lives and actions of those who have preceded us in

the procession of the generations, are full of instruction and interest.

In many instances they hold up to our emulation great models of

patriotism, patience, endurance, activity and pluck. It is to be

regretted that many documents of past ages have been destroyed through

lack of knowledge of their real value, and of the light they would have

thrown upon the early history of the country. Some few, regarded merely

as the relics of departed ancestors, have been so secretly kept and

treasured, that dust, must and rust have all but completely defaced

them.


If our ancestors had been wise in preserving the papers of their

fathers, long ago there might have been collected from such documents,

and displayed, many particulars of positive information concerning the

very early history of the English in Acadia.


We might have possessed a much fuller history of the times when great

difficulties and dangers opposed the settlers. When rushing rivers had

to be crossed without boat or bridge; when men and women often found it

necessary to contend single handed with Indians; and when, for meeting

the many obstacles that placed themselves in their path, our ancestors

were often but poorly equipped.


Whilst we take pride in the hardships cheerfully borne by our

forefathers in the early colonial days, may we not be sometimes inclined

to forget those fleet-footed, clever, dusky sons of the forest, to whose

generous aid they were not infrequently indebted for protection from

hostile men and savage beasts, and even sometimes for sustenance?


When we have secured positive information that now and again there have

appeared among the brawny men of the forest noble specimens of all that

is true and kind, let us not fail to record their deeds of faithfulness

and heroism. The least we can do for such is to bring to light their

actions and preserve their history. When beneath the shade of the

forest, on the trackless desert, on the rushing river, in tempest and

thunder, or when watching in the vicinity of an old fort or near the log

cabin of the early colonists, the Red man has been found a faithful

friend and guide; should not his deeds of kindness, faithfulness and

bravery be recorded side by side with those of the noblest of the human

race?


The story related in the following chapters has been gathered from facts

stated in time-worn documents, which have been lying for generations

concealed in a wooden box. The only regret of the writer is, that it was

impossible for him to gain access to all the old musty and defaced

papers in the box. The old gentleman, in whose possession they were

found, is very old and eccentric, and by no effort or persuasion could

the writer induce him to part company with the documents, but for a

short time. But although the task of procuring them was extremely

difficult, and that of deciphering them afterwards was both difficult

and tedious, still the satisfaction of having rescued from decay and

destruction, what seems so interesting, is satisfaction sufficient for

the writer.


That portion of the documents relating the events in connection with the

first and second settlement of an English officer and his family, during

the last century, in a district which is now said to be one of the most

beautiful portions of Canada, is most instructive and interesting,

although at times, while deciphering it, the writer felt his blood

quicken in its pulsations, and tears forcing their way to the surface.


A few years previous to this English officers first attempt at

settlement in Nova Scotia, he came out to Quebec with his regiment. The

remaining portion of this introductory chapter will narrate some events

in connection with the early life of the officer, his coming to Quebec

with his regiment, his short stay there, and his return to his native

country:—


On board the transport Pitt, in the year 1765, at Cork, embarked

Captain Godfrey with his regiment, the 52nd foot, for Quebec, North

America.


On the passage the Pitt was wrecked in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where

Captain Godfrey with his regiment suffered many hardships.


The ship ran ashore in a dense fog, which had prevailed for several

days. The Captain remaining by the wreck for eleven days, assisted in

saving the lives of the soldiers wives and children, and in landing the

King's stores. The transport struck well up the gulf on the Nova Scotian

coast (now New Brunswick). The exact locality is not stated. The night

of the disaster was densely dark, and soon after striking the ship

began to pound and leak badly. Had the wind sprung up during the hours

of darkness not a soul on board would have lived to record the tale.

Very early the next morning, as Captain Godfrey was standing on the

quarter deck, conversing with the officer in charge of the ship, the

rain began suddenly to descend in torrents and the wind to freshen. The

mist that had enshrouded the ship for so many days, began to lift, and

the sun shone through by instalments. Soon it was seen that the Pitt

was hemmed in by rocks, almost wedged in among them. Fortunately the

storm soon abated, and the situation of the vessel kept her in an

upright position. The fog settled down again, and for the next ten days

all on board were kept busy in saving their effects and the King's

stores.


At the end of ten days all on board were taken off. General Murray,

commanding at Quebec, by some means not recorded, having heard of the

disaster, sent a man-of-war schooner to the relief of the sufferers, and

they were safely conveyed to Quebec.


Captain Godfrey, through exposure and fatigue, contracted a severe cold,

and at last, his life being despaired of, the surgeon of the regiment

advised his return to England. He applied to General Clavering for leave

of absence, or to grant him permission to sell out of the army. The

permission being granted, he soon set about preparing to leave Quebec,

and rejoin his wife and five children in England. Captain Godfrey notes

in a memorandum his great sorrow in parting from his regiment, and that

his zeal for serving his King and country was so great that nothing but

extreme weakness would have induced him to part from his regiment and

King George the Third's service.


Before leaving Quebec to return home to his native land, Captain Godfrey

visited the spot where, six years before, the gallant Wolfe had poured

out his life's blood in the service of his King and country. Here the

Captain knelt and offered up to Him who guides the stars in their

courses, thanksgiving for the brilliant and decisive victory gained by

the British arms.


The following is from one of his memoranda:—"As I stood, and as I knelt

where Wolfe fell, I more than ever realized what it is to be a brave

soldier and a good man. As I rose from the spot I whispered to myself,

if I am, through the providence of the Almighty, allowed to once again

visit my native land, I will go to the widowed mother of General Wolfe

and tell her where I have been and what I have seen. That I have stood

on the very spot where victory and death gave the crowning lustre to the

name of her great son."


Charles Godfrey was born at St Ann's, England, in the year 1730. The

following, copied from an old document, gives a brief sketch of his

early career:—"Was put on board His Majesty's ship Bedford, Capt.

Cornwall master, in the year 1741, and in 1742 went out to the

Mediterranean. In 1743 was at the siege of Villa Franca, where with a

large party of seamen was ordered on shore, and quartered at a six gun

battery, under the command of Capt. Gugger, of the Royal Artillery. Was

at the battle of Toulon, with Admirals Matthews and Lostock, on board

said ship Bedford, then commanded by George Townsend. Was at the

taking of several rich ships off the Island of Malta, which ships and

their cargoes were afterward restored to the Genoese. Continued in the

navy till the peace of Utretch, and for sometime subsequently.

Afterward, a warrant being procured, attended the Royal Academy at

Woolwich as a gentleman cadet, in which station was allowed to remain

till 1755. Received a commission, and was appointed to the 52nd foot, by

the recommendation of His Royal Highness the Duke of Cambridge, who was

afterwards pleased to recommend me for a Lieutenancy, and a few years

later my friends procured for me a Captaincy."


1Captain Godfrey returned to England on board a transport from Quebec.

This young officer appears to have been highly respected by the

different Generals and Field Officers under whom he had served. He was

presented, shortly after his arrival in England, with a certificate of

character, signed by Lieut.-Genl. John Clavering, Colonel of the 52nd

Regt., Lieut.-Genl. Edward Sandford, Lieut.-Genl. Sir John Seabright,

Major-Genl. Guy Carleton, Major-Genl. John Alex. McKay, Lieut.-Col.

Valentine Jones, Lieut.-Genl. Burgoyue, and Major Philip Skene.


The above has been copied principally for the purpose of showing that

the following story has for its characters those who once lived and

moved in the early English colonial life of Acadia. If the districts and

places where the events related in this book occurred could speak, they

would tell nearly the same thrilling and extraordinary story. In many

of these localities great and important changes have taken place through

a century and a quarter of time, but the records of the past remain

unchanged.


Our barns may be built over the graves of the Indians, and our houses on

the sites of their wigwams; our cattle may graze upon the hillsides and

valleys of their hunting grounds, and our churches may be erected on

positions where the Red men of the forest gathered together to invoke

the blessing of the Great Chief of the everlasting hunting ground, yet

what is truly written of the past must remain unalterable.


NOTE.—The wrecked transport Pitt was named, it is said, in honour of

the Earl of Chatham; and tradition states that one of the boats of the

ship drifted from the wreck and went ashore at a point of land near

where the town of Chatham now stands, the ship's name being painted on

the boat; and from this circumstance Chatham, on the Miramichi River,

received its name.


    CHAPTER I.


    FIRST EXPERIENCE OF COLONIAL LIFE, 1769-70.


Captain Godfrey's health gradually improved after his return to his

native country. When he thought himself sufficiently recovered he felt

anxious to embark in some branch of business, and not feeling inclined

to do so in England, he purchased a grant of land from Lynge Tottenham,

Esq., this land was situated on the bank of the River St. John, Nova

Scotia.


In the early part of the year 1769, after three years of rest, Captain

Godfrey purchased various kinds of merchandize, which he was advised

were best adapted to the colonial trade. He freighted a vessel in

London, and embarked with his wife and family for Halifax, in the month

of June, 1769.


On the passage out the weather was usually fine, but the progress was

slow, and nothing remarkable occurred on board during the sixty-two days

they were in crossing the Atlantic.


Soon after landing at Halifax, Captain Godfrey heard that the Governor

of Nova Scotia, (Lord William Campbell,) required some person of

experience to enter into possession of Fort Frederick, situated at the

mouth of the River St. John, and take charge of the arms, ammunition,

and all other of His Majesty King George the Third's stores. He had an

interview with the Governor and was appointed to take charge of the

fort.


After having secured the appointment at Fort Frederick, he concluded to

commence trading operations at that post, and gave bonds to the governor

in the sum of one thousand pounds for the privilege of carrying on a

legitimate business with the settlers and Indians.2


After spending the winter at Halifax, he chartered a brig in the month

of May, 1770, and then putting on board his goods and stores sailed for

Fort Frederick with his wife and family. On his arrival at the fort he

carefully surveyed the situation and concluded that he would abandon the

idea of trading there.


He found no one at the fort to assist him in protecting it, and a few

days after his arrival the Indians became so troublesome and threatening

that he found it would be impossible to remain there, protect the fort

single-handed, and carry on trading operations successfully.


One afternoon the Indians appeared before the fort in numbers,

threatening that if the place was not vacated at once they would murder

the occupants. They then made a rush and got within the enclosure, and

soon after retired.


Captain Godfrey had fortunately purchased from the master of the vessel

in which he brought his merchandize to the fort, a small boat. The boat

had been securely moored at the island below the fort.


The day following the assembling at the fort the savages again appeared

and attempted to steal the boat, and would have done so had not Mrs.

Godfrey succeeded in reaching the shore in time to discharge a musket at

the thieves. The Redskins pulled the boat to the spot where she stood,

but Mrs. Godfrey never moved from the position she had taken. When the

Indians were in the act of jumping on shore she ordered them to take the

boat back to the place from whence they had loosed it. One of the

Redskins, a tall, muscular fellow, who could speak some English, asked

her if she would get into the boat and go with them. If so, the boat

would be taken back and made fast. She replied, "I have no doubt you are

an honest man and would do no injury to a weak, pale-faced woman, I will

go with you." And as she said these words, she sprang into the boat and

sat down, resting the musket upon her knees.


The Indians paddled the boat back to the place whence they had loosed

it, and not one of them uttered a word. After the boat had been made

fast Mrs. Godfrey was assisted ashore by the tall, muscular savage, his

four companions walking away without saying a word. They were soon

joined by their tall, muscular friend, and a few minutes later all were

lost to view among the trees on the shore.


Mrs. Godfrey retired to the fort, where she was warmly congratulated by

her husband for the tact and courage she had displayed in presence of

the savages. She replied, "the Indians seemed completely taken aback

when I jumped into the boat and had not recovered from their surprise

when they parted from me, and while I was sitting in the boat, the deep,

black eyes of the tall, muscular fellow looked straight and steady at

me, and at times I felt as though they were piercing me through and

through."


The evening was a solemn one at Fort Frederick. The Captain and his wife

talked over their situation, and the children were restless, the

slightest noise about the place making the little ones tremble like

aspen leaves. The Captain and his wife agreed that it would be useless,

while the Indians were so troublesome, to remain at the Fort and attempt

to transact business with the settlers, who were few indeed.


As they sat together that night in the Fort by the dim light of a

flickering candle, expecting every moment to be disturbed by the

war-whoop of the savages, Captain Godfrey said to Margaret, (for such

was the name of his wife,) "our situation is serious." She replied, "I

believe it to be most dangerous." "What move would you propose," asked

the Captain. Margaret answered, "I would propose to return to Halifax,

if it be possible to get there." The Captain then said to his wife,

"What do you think about going to Grimross Neck where our grant of land

is?" Margaret replied, "I am your wife, whatever you think best to do,

do it, and I will follow and support you to the best of my ability." She

then, together with her husband and children, knelt in the lonely Fort

and asked Him who had guided and protected them thus far not to forsake

them in their present situation, but to guide, instruct and lead them in

the future. She rose on her feet, walked across the small, dingy

apartment, kissed each of the children, then taking her husband by the

hand, said to him, in a clear and decided voice, "Whither thou goest I

will follow, where thou resteth I will rest, and where thou settlest

there will I be found with thee." And in presence of the children God

had given them, they bound their hearts to suffering and death.


Fatigue and fear had overcome the little ones, and in a short time they

were sleeping soundly upon the floor.


After some further conversation between the Captain and his wife, it was

agreed that he should attempt to proceed before dawn in the little boat

to Annapolis Royal, and there, if possible, purchase a small vessel

suitable to convey his goods and family up the river to his grant of

land.


At four o'clock he secretly and alone left the fort, waving with his

hand an adieu to his wife, as he stepped out of the door. He carried

with him to the boat a camp blanket which he intended to hoist as a

sail. At four o'clock, thirty minutes, he was on his way. As the little

boat passed the island at the mouth of the harbour a breeze sprang up.

He hoisted the sail, making it fast to one of the oars, which was used

as a mast; the other oar being brought into play for steering purposes.

Captain Godfrey had been fortunate in bringing with him from England

several small compasses and two larger ones, one of the latter he took

with him.


A gentle but fair breeze followed the little ship from land to land. The

Captain found great difficulty in sighting the entrance to Digby Bay,

where he arrived safe and sound at eleven o'clock the following morning.


The next day he proceeded to Annapolis Royal arriving there at noon,

where he purchased a large sloop, and without delay got his boat on

board and next day at the turn of tide sailed for Digby. Here he took on

board some water, and after waiting several hours for a fair wind sailed

for the mouth of the St. John. At ten o'clock, a.m., June 30th, he set

sail to recross the Bay of Fundy and rejoin his wife and family at Fort

Frederick. He arrived off the harbour the following morning quite early,

but was unable to anchor off Fort Frederick, till the evening on account

of fog. On arriving at the Fort he was greatly relieved of apprehensions

that would obtrude themselves upon him during his lonely trip by finding

his wife and children all well.


The following day he commenced to get his merchandize on board the

sloop. His wife and eldest son assisting. It took fully ten days to

accomplish the task, which proved to be a tedious and toilsome one

indeed. At last, everything being ready, he vacated Fort Frederick and

sailed for his possessions up the river, intending there to settle and

trade.


Not many hours after they had left the Fort the report of a musket was

heard from the shore. Soon a canoe was seen approaching the sloop. As it

came near the vessel, an Indian was seen as its only occupant. He

paddled his canoe alongside the sloop. Captain Godfrey attentively

watched his every movement while Mrs. Godfrey seemed quite indifferent

at the presence of the stranger. She threw him a small line and made

signs to him to make fast his canoe, which he appeared quickly to

understand. Mrs. Godfrey then motioned to the Indian to come on board,

and he at once bounded over the rail. As he stood on deck, his comely

Indian features were lit up by a good humoured smile. He looked a giant,

brave and active. He was teeming all over with youthful vigour. His eyes

were black like polished jet, sparkling and deep set. His mouth large,

square and firm; and his hair like threads of coarse, black silk,

brushed back from a low, narrow forehead, hung loosely down over his

broad, square shoulders.


His whole frame seemed stirred with a strong nervous action, and a quick

but expressive motion of his small brown hand appeared as a signal for

conversation. He at once spoke, "May be if go to Grimross be scalped,"

and every word brought with it increased action of both hand and body.

He continued, "Indians say war coming, must have pale face blood and

scalp."


Capt. Godfrey said not a word, but looked serious and pale; while deep

anxiety was pictured on every feature of his face. He felt that it was

no use to retreat, and situated as they were, where could they retreat

in safety. Fort Frederick at the mouth of the river had been surrounded

by blood-thirsty savages, who had threatened them with fire and murder

if they did not abandon the place. In this distracting situation Captain

Godfrey held a council of war within himself, and finally decided, come

what might, evil or good, he would push on to his destination.


He wondered how the Indian knew he was bound for Grimross. It occurred

to him that perhaps the savage was trying to find out where he intended

to land, and there be on hand to murder all on board and seize the sloop

and cargo. He thought, "if the Indian is sincere in warning us, what

interest has he in doing so? What could he expect in return for his kind

act?" These and many similar thoughts rushed quickly through the

agitated brain of the Captain. The Indian stood silent and motionless

for a moment, then returned to his canoe and paddled toward the shore.


The eyes of Captain Godfrey followed the Red man to the shore and

watched him until he disappeared among the trees on the river bank. The

sloop was kept on her course up the river. Just after the sun had sunk

beneath the horizon, Captain Godfrey, by the persuasion of his wife,

anchored the sloop in a small recess in the shore. From the time the

Indian had reached the bank the Captain's wife scarcely ever lifted her

eyes from gazing on the right bank of the river. Was she watching for a

place to safely anchor at night? Or was she watching for the Indian's

return? These questions were agitating the Captain's thoughts.


Captain Godfrey had never fully recovered from a weakness to his nervous

system, caused by the severe hardships he had endured in the Gulf of St

Lawrence. He was strongly opposed to anchoring the sloop so near the

shore. He felt fearful that during the long watches of the night all on

board might be murdered. The armament of the vessel consisted of two

muskets, two pistols, and a sword. Her cargo was valued at over two

thousand pounds sterling. She was deeply laden, and it was with great

difficulty that all the goods and chattels had been stowed on board;

several boxes and bundles being closely packed and lashed on deck.


After everything had been made snug on board, sails furled, &c., the

Captain and his wife asked the blessing of the all-seeing One during the

hours of the night. The Captain was very tired, and the events of the

day had not added to his comfort. His wife persuaded him to go into the

small cabin and rest. She promised to call him if the least danger

appeared. She said that she was only too willing to stand as sentinel

until the sun-rise. It was only through a knowledge of the determined

spirit, good judgment, quick eye, and self possession of his wife that

he was induced to retire to rest.


The children unconscious of the dangers surrounding them, were nestled

together in the small cabin like young birds in a nest. During four long

hours nothing unusual occurred to break the stillness of the night. The

rustling of the leaves on the trees not many yards distant, and the

rippling of the water were all that could be heard, a dense darkness, a

blackness doubly deep appeared to settle over and around the little

vessel. The sentinel placed her soft white hand close to her face but

could not even distinguish its outlines.


At this moment there flashed through her mind the words, "Watchman,

what of the night." The words were accompanied by a hand gently laid

upon her shoulder. She remained as motionless as a statue in the gloom.

A gentle breath whispered in her ear, "me Paul;" "come tell you Indians

on other bank river;" adding strength to the expression by taking her

hand and pointing it to the opposite bank. He then again whispered,

"Fire gun next setting sun, where stop," and then suddenly left her

side, and she saw nothing more that night of Paul Guidon, for such was

the Indian's name.


Captain Godfrey, after his many days of toil and anxiety, slept so

soundly that he did not wake till the sun had risen. As soon as

breakfast was over, and a chapter had been read from an old family

Bible, which had accompanied four generations of the Landers through

this vale of tears, sorrows and joys, and a short prayer read from an

old service book, presented to Captain Godfrey by General Murray at

Quebec, the sloop was got under way and proceeded on her voyage, the

wind being fair and light. The prospect was not one to gladden the

hearts of the voyagers, though the day was fine and sky clear. The

progress was slow. Captain Godfrey was in better spirits than on the

previous day, the quiet night and refreshing sleep had somewhat braced

him up. The children sat on deck during the day, chatting, playing and

singing, while their mother, dauntless and buoyant in spirit, retired to

rest in the little smoke-box of a cabin. She knew that very much

depended upon her behaviour and courage in safely reaching Grimross

Neck. She closed her eyes with the whispered words upon her lips, "I

will follow what I believe to be the path of safety, and I will tread it

with a firm and unfaltering footstep, praise to the Great King who sent

us Paul Guidon in the thick darkness to watch over us from the river's

bank. It brings to my remembrance what I have read in the Book of books,

of Pharaoh's daughter standing at the river's brink and rescuing the

babe, and seeing that no harm befell it."


Little progress was made during the day. An hour or two before the

shadows of evening had begun to fling their leaden mantle around the

sloop, Mrs. Godfrey appeared on deck. Perfect stillness seemed to reign

on every hand; even the little craft appeared to be half asleep, so

lazily did she move along. All above and about stretched the wondrous

beauty of the sky; the deep blue clouds, as the day wore away, becoming

tinged with gold, contrasted in loveliness with the green of earth. Not

a sound was there to stir the perfect stillness except the rippling of

the water against the vessel.


As Margaret sat beside her husband on that lovely evening of July, the

deep feelings that were stirred within her soul seemed to find their

natural outlet, as she turned to her husband and said, "this seems like

a glimpse of some better world." He replied, "it appears as though we

are sailing through a land of perfect rest." "I trust we are, though we

sail through a country peopled with savages." She replied, "To-day we

beheld the sun in his glory, and strong in his power, now he is

departing, but I trust as we continue to sail o'er the ocean of time,

guided by the King of Pilots toward a land where glory never fades, and

where the True Light never grows dim, our passage may continually be lit

up by the reflecting rays of the Sun of Righteousness." As she finished

speaking a bright light flashed on the starboard shore, quickly followed

by the report of a musket. The Captain, starting at the report,

remarked, "perhaps that Indian (Paul) has been watching and following."

Here the Captain's words were cut short by a loud cry from one of the

children and the sound of a splash. Little Jack, the fourth child, had

tripped against the forward rail and gone overboard. His mother, almost

as quickly as the flash of a gun, threw herself overboard at the stern

of the sloop, holding on to the rail with her hands and calling to the

little fellow to catch hold of her dress, as the tide carried him toward

her. He was too far out to reach her skirt, and the running water

carried him by her. She immediately let go both hands and floated from

the vessel, and made a desperate effort to reach her boy. The Captain,

almost beside himself, put the helm hard down, and was in the act of

plunging in. Meantime his wife and son were drifting farther away. Just

then, making a second desperate effort, she succeeded in grasping her

child. At this moment a canoe shot like an arrow past the sloop, in it

was Paul Guidon, paddling with might and main, making straight for the

drowning mother and her boy. In another minute he had the child grasped

firmly in his long sinewy arms, and laying his breast and head over the

stern of the canoe, he called to the mother to grasp at once his long

hair as its ends fell into the water. He managed to get the child safely

into his canoe, but he experienced great difficulty in saving its

mother. She drifted fully one hundred yards, but all the distance

holding stoutly to the Indian's locks. With all the strength of Paul

Guidon he was not able to get Mrs. Godfrey into the canoe. Once he

nearly succeeded, but almost upset his little bark. He told her to cling

tightly to his hair, as he shoved the paddle over her head, and at last

he got the canoe to move slowly ahead, and in a few minutes time he was

at the side of the sloop, and the mother and child were rescued from a

watery grave. The Indian would not go on board, and as soon as he saw

that the mother and child were likely to recover, he pulled away to the

shore.


The child soon recovered, but the mother lay upon the deck for some time

in a half unconscious state. At times a quiet happiness seemed singing

in her soul, that often broke into words of praise as the vessel drifted

along in the stillness. On the right and left slept the country with its

wooded hills and dales. As Margaret Godfrey recovered she said,

"Charles, we appear to be sleeping on to our destination." "Yes," he

said; "but perhaps that Indian has been watching and following us,

hiding among the trees along the shore; and as we have been going slowly

all day, he could with ease keep way with us. He may now consider us far

enough away from the fort to decoy and murder us, seize our vessel and

goods, and no suspicion rest upon him as the murderer and robber."


"It may be that he has accomplices on our track; a band of savages to

quietly dispose of us and seize our possessions." As he spoke these

words he appeared much more agitated than on the previous evening.

Margaret replied, "God's will be done! We must anchor at some point

to-night—Why not anchor here? At the earnest solicitation of his wife,

Captain Godfrey consented to run the sloop toward the shore and anchor.


After a lengthened discussion between the Captain and his wife upon the

question of keeping watch during the night, Margaret carried her point,

and soon after stood alone on the deck.


The reader, doubtless, will wonder why Margaret expressed so strong a

desire to keep watch through the long, lonely hours of darkness. Before

the conclusion of the story is reached, he will have found out the

reason.


Soon all was hushed, gross darkness had gathered over the face of

nature, and the eyes of the beloved on board were closed in sleep. At

about midnight Margaret was slightly startled at hearing a footstep on

deck. "Paul," she whispered, "is that you." "Me," he answered in a low,

soft tone. "Most Indians away, far up country after game, and not come

back few days."


Paul Guidon was a sub-chief, and one of the bravest of the tribe over

which he exercised some authority. He was feared and respected by all

the tribes of the St. John. He had used all his cunning and power to

pilot the sloop safely to her destination. He had for several days

spread the report that large herds of caribou and moose had appeared in

a part of the country forty miles west of the St. John River. The

Indians took the bait and had suddenly left in pursuit of the game.


Before leaving the deck Paul advised Margaret to get the vessel under

way at daylight next morning, in order that the journey might be

completed before the next setting of the sun. He then took Mrs. Godfrey

by the hand and raising it to his broad breast passed it firmly over his

quickly throbbing heart, and almost instantly turned and shot from her

presence like an arrow in the darkness. Very early in the morning the

sloop was made ready to proceed on her voyage. The wind was blowing

stiffly and fair, the little vessel reached along and arrived at her

destination at five o'clock in the afternoon. The anchor was let go

between an island and the river's bank. Thanksgiving and praise were

offered on board for past mercies and supplication for continued

guidance. Neither was Paul Guidon forgotten, for Margaret breathed a

silent supplication to Him who can soften and subdue the savage breast,

to guide, control and direct the life and steps of her benefactor.


    CHAPTER II.


    TRADING,—TROUBLE,—RETREAT.


After landing at Grimross, Captain Godfrey looked about to find his lot

of land. Lot No. 14 he found belonged to a Captain Spry, lot No. 15 to a

Reverend Smith, and his own lot he found to be No. 16. These lots were

all facing the St. John river, and extending back parallel with each

other. In looking over the plan of the lots, it appears that Captain

Godfrey settled on No. 14, Spry's lot, and on this lot he commenced

trading operations in an old house situated not far from a stream

leading from a lake on his own lot to the St. John. On Captain Godfrey's

lot were two small log houses, one occupied by a person named Sayhon,

and the other by a man named Crabtree. It may be, that the Captain

settled on Spry's lot because he could trade here to the best advantage.

Here he commenced business after expending forty pounds, sterling money,

in repairing the log house and adding a store room, made of solid logs.

About the middle of September, 1770, he opened out his wares and began

business. A few days later several Redskins came to his shop and warned

him to move away from the place, threatening, if he did not do so, to

burn his buildings and goods.


The Indians did not trouble him further until the middle of November,

when about thirty of them came to his place of business with beaver,

otter, raccoon, mink and other skins. These he took in exchange for

blankets, powder and other goods, the Indians appearing well satisfied

with the exchange. About a fortnight later the Indians again returned in

numbers, accompanied by a white man who acted as spokesman. The white

man, a peculiar looking character, with one eye looking due north and

the other due east, from beneath a forehead very much resembling that of

a monkey, stuttered out to Captain G.: "We-e-e-e co-co-mé t-t-to

war-war-warn you t-to g-g-g-git ou-out. Th-the la-lan-lands ar-are Free

n-sh le-le-lands, an-and th-the In-in-d-dans we-we-will dri-dri-drive

aw-all de-de-damd E-e-en-glis way, an-an gi-gi-give the-the-em

b-b-b-back to Fre-e-e-nsh." The Indians and their low-browed, cross-eyed

spokesman then left the Captain's place of business without uttering

another word. On Christmas day, 1770, or about one month after their

last visit, eight of the Indians, accompanied by two squaws, returned to

the store at Grimross Neck and whooped out in tones of fury, "Fire,

blood, scalps."


Captain Godfrey immediately barred his shop door, and also the door of

his house, seeing that the savages were bent on mischief. The children

were inside the store and house, and were terrified and trembling. At

length the Redskins became so excited and noisy and so wild in their

movements, that the place seemed like a pandemonium. They were-armed,

each one having a knife about ten inches in length stuck in his belt.


Captain Godfrey consulted with his wife as to the wisest course to be

pursued, but no definite line of action was arranged. The two old

muskets were in the bedroom, loaded, not having been discharged since

they were fired off on leaving Fort Frederick. The Captain's wife ran to

the room and brought out both guns into the kitchen. She handed one to

her husband remarking, "if the brutes attempt to force their way into

the house shoot the first one that puts his moccasin over the door

sill." At this time the howling, yelling and cursing of the

blood-thirsty fiends would strike terror into the stoutest heart.

Finally they took up a large stick of wood that was lying near the

kitchen door and made a desperate attempt to smash it in. Mrs. Godfrey,

who had stood near the door for sometime, appeared calm and decided amid

all the murderous clamour. She stepped back a pace, and placing the butt

of the musket against her hip, with the muzzle slanting upwards, stood

firm as a statue.


The door was soon forced and the fiends came tumbling in. Mrs. Godfrey

fired, the charge going over the heads of the savages and entering the

ceiling above the door. The Indians in the rear seeing their comrades

fall, and thinking they were killed by the shot, at once retreated

uttering terrible threats of vengeance. One of the squaws, a short,

stout old creature, was so terrified by the report of the musket and the

falling to the floor of the three Indians, that in her bewildered

retreat she tumbled headlong down a steep, stony bank and laid as if

dead on the ice below. She was left by her companions, who travelled as

fast as their legs would carry them. The old squaw was found and taken

prisoner by Mrs. Godfrey. Her nose and one rib were broken, her left arm

dislocated at the elbow, and both her eyes completely closed with heavy

shutters. She presented a pitiable appearance, as she staggered along

toward the house supported by her captor. The Indians were so completely

surprised and cowed by the courage of Mrs. Godfrey that they never came

back to look after the wounded squaw, or sent to inquire whether she was

living or dead.


As soon as the old squaw began to recover, Mrs. Godfrey found out that

the old woman could speak some English. She said she was a widow about

sixty years old. That her husband had been killed at Fort Pitt in 1763.

Her only son had been taken prisoner by the English at Fort Pitt, and

had afterwards remained nine moons with an English officer in New York.

The officer went away to England and wanted her son to go with him, but

on the eve of the officer's departure he ran away, soon got on the trail

of his mother, and at last found her at Detroit living with a band of

Iroquois. Not long afterward she and her boy wandered from post to post

and camp to camp until they at last got over among the tribe on the St.

John, where they had made their home among a strange tribe for the past

two years. Her son did not respect the tribe with whom they lived. He

had often told her that these Indians were not pure bloods. Her son was

sixteen years old when taken prisoner at Fort Pitt. She had always been

called Mag, but when any of the tribe addressed her, it was by the not

very respectful addition of "Old Mag." Her boy had gone toward the

setting sun to be with a party of English officers on a hunting

excursion, he had left her in September and would not return for some

moons.


Captain Godfrey and his family rested in comparative peace for some

weeks, and Mrs. Godfrey drew from Old Mag many stories respecting the

manner of life among the various tribes of American Indians.


About one month after the old squaw had been captured, she began to

appear exceedingly dull and dispirited. The Captain's wife said to her

one morning, "Mag, are you ill," "No! no!" she replied, "me no sick

to-day," "bad dream some nights ago. Saw all Indians outside house, and

big black devil's spirit come into them, black spirits come out woods,

and fire on their heads, all went into Indians and made them dance war,

yell and whoop and burn house."


All went fairly well until the 26th February, 1771, when the red men

again appeared at the premises of the Captain. They were armed, and

their actions seemed to be in keeping with Old Mag's dream.


Their shrieks, yells and war-whoops were terrible, they acted like

demons. The children hid under the beds and held on to the garments of

their parents. The terrified little ones trembled like leaves in an

autumn breeze. Spirits let loose from the regions of the damned could

hardly present a more devilish appearance than did the savages. They

were armed with muskets. Old Mag, who was crouching in a corner of the

kitchen, shook with fear, her teeth were chattering, and she appeared

like a person badly affected with fever and ague.


The Redskins, about twenty in number, ran round and round the house

roaring like wild beasts thirsting for gore. Charlie, the Captain's

eldest boy, came rushing into the kitchen screaming out that two of the

Indians were making a fire at the store door. Captain Godfrey ran to the

shop, looked out of the window and was horrified to find the side of the

building in flames. A minute after he had left the kitchen two of the

red devils broke in the door, Mrs. Godfrey, with Charlie holding on to

her skirt, had taken up a position in front of Old Mag, as the charging

enemy came toward her, she fired. There was a yell, as of death. Captain

Godfrey had placed the other musket in Old Mag's lap, Mrs. Godfrey

instantly seized it and quick as a flash again fired and the door way

was cleared.


In a few moments the smoke had cleared away. Two human forms lay across

the door sill and one within the kitchen. These were the bodies of one

dead and two dying Indians. The dead man was completely scalped, the

whole top of his head being torn off. The other two were so terribly

mutilated about their faces and necks that they lived but a few minutes.

Forty minutes after Mrs. Godfrey had fired the first shot scarcely a

vestige of anything remained on the spot where the house had stood. As

soon as the savages were aware that three of their comrades had fallen

in the assault, they beat a hasty retreat.


Let the reader pause for a few moments to consider the situation of

Captain Godfrey, his wife and their five children. There they were alone

in the wilderness, thousands of miles from friends and home. Out in the

cold, amid the frost and snow of an Acadian winter, without a house to

shelter them, a friend to cheer them, or a fire to warm them; surrounded

by demons of the forest, panting and thirsting for their blood. There

was no possible escape by water, the St. John was covered by a thick

winding sheet of ice, and the sloop was lying some miles away in an icy

bed of a lake. The history of early colonial life does not and cannot

present a more affecting scene than that of the Godfrey family, as they

stood alone on the banks of the river St. John in the midnight of a Nova

Scotian winter.


All that was saved from the flames were several pieces of half-burnt

pork, the two old muskets, a few half-burnt blankets, one hundred and

forty pounds of beaver skin, between two and three hundred weight of

gunpowder, the old family Bible and service book, and a trunk containing

some papers and old clothes. The above articles Captain Godfrey and his

son, at the risk of their lives, saved from complete destruction. In an

hour the little band of early settlers was reduced from comfortable

circumstances to a misery beyond the power of words to express. Darkness

would soon cover the spot of desolation. But five hours of daylight were

left in which escape could be made. They knew not in which direction to

flee for shelter. The Captain consulted with his brave partner, but all

seemed dark; no way of escape presented itself. To remain where they

were during the coming night meant death. There were only two log houses

in the district and they were miles away. Finally Mrs. Godfrey

assembled her shivering children about her and read aloud the

twenty-third psalm, and closing the old service book she said to her

husband, let us no longer tarry here, let us make haste towards the

sloop. As they were about to start, it suddenly occurred to Mrs Godfrey

that Old Mag was missing. The Captain had not seen her since he placed

the musket in her lap. The children had not seen her since the burning

of the house, and Mrs. Godfrey had not seen her after she had taken the

musket off her lap. The old squaw's absence caused a delay in setting

out for the sloop. As no trace of Old Mag could be found, it was the

opinion of both the Captain and his wife, that she had either perished

in the flames or had slipped out of the kitchen before the smoke had

cleared away and followed the Indians in their retreat.


Neither the Captain nor his wife would leave the locality without making

a search for Old Mag. During the search, Captain Godfrey, whose strength

had been severely tested since his arrival at Grimross in July, sank to

the ground in a swoon. At this crisis his wife displayed the greatness

of her character. As troubles thickened about her she seemed to develop

qualities that only woman cast in an heroic mould are capable of

exhibiting. She whispered to her husband, "We cannot find Mag, I must

save you." These words appeared to have a magic effect on the Captain.

He rose to his feet, supported by his wife, and soon after they were

staggering on towards the river leading to the lake, followed by their

five children, the eldest, who was but twelve, carrying with him his

youngest brother, only two years old.


At length they reached the lake, and at this point of the journey Mrs.

Godfrey was compelled to order a halt. She was heavily handicapped,

having a large shawl tied across her shoulders filled with the burnt

pork and some blankets. After a few minutes rest they were again tugging

along towards their little ark. As the light of the sun gradually faded

away, the little band of colonists tried to quicken their pace, but they

tried in vain. They were so exhausted that it was with great difficulty

they kept on their feet.


The children were more dead than alive, and the approaching darkness

filled them with terror. Their mother would say to them, "Keep along,

follow closely, the moon is rising, we shall soon have plenty of light."

In this manner they toiled on till midnight, when they reached the

sloop. Fortunately for the little band of wanderers, Captain Godfrey had

left on board the vessel a small Dutch stove and a number of broken

boxes. A fire was soon made, some of the burnt pork was sliced and put

in a pan and fried for the night's meal. But the children sank to rest

soon after getting on board, and lay huddled together on the cabin

floor. After the Captain and his wife had partaken of the meal and

before retiring to rest on the hard boards of the floor, Mrs. Godfrey

read, by the dim light of a candle, the fifty-fourth psalm.


Nothing can better prove the genuineness of a life, the soundness of a

profession, the real character of a man or woman, than those extreme

trials and difficulties of earth, when no friends are near to help and

where no way of escape seems possible. In trials, such as those related

above, the noblest traits of character or the hollowness and rottenness

of a profession are often plainly seen. Five cold winter days and nights

came and passed, yet no relief came to the imprisoned family. They dare

not move out, fearing the Indians would see them and come at night and

murder them. The sixth day Crabtree, who lived some miles distant from

where the Godfreys had resided, having heard of the attack of the

savages and the destruction they had caused, made his way to the scene

of the ruins. He could find no trace of the Godfreys and was returning

by the border of the lake to his log cabin, when he saw the sloop far in

the distance like a speck on the frozen surface of the lake. He hastened

out to where she lay. To his surprise and joy he found out, when nearing

the little craft, signs of life on board. Sparks were issuing from the

cabin. Very soon he was on board. He was met at the companion-way by the

Captain who gave him a thousand welcomes. Crabtree, after a few minutes

rest and conversation, started for his home, eleven miles distant,

promising to return early the next morning with a sledge to assist in

taking the children to his cabin. In the morning he returned, and

Captain Godfrey, his wife, and little ones, left the sloop and went to

Crabtree's. Captain and Mrs. Godfrey and Charlie had to walk the entire

distance over the lake and through the forest to Crabtree's log house.


The man who had rescued them attended to their wants as well as his

circumstances would allow. He kept the distressed family until the month

of May, when the ice in the river broke up. Captain Godfrey then set to

work to fit out the sloop, being determined to leave the place as soon

as possible. The sails and part of the rigging were consumed in the fire

at Grimross. He had fortunately saved two of the compasses from the

flames. After days of toil he managed to get the vessel in fair working

order. The old half-burnt blankets were patched together and a mainsail

and jib were completed. On the 30th of May, 1771, he set sail for Fort

Frederick.


On the passage down the river several Indians were seen on the banks of

the stream, but none of them made any trouble. After eleven months

absence the Captain found himself at Fort Frederick once again. Captain

Godfrey said to his wife, "Margaret, what changes are often wrought in a

few months." "Yes! true!" she replied, "we have lost our property, but

we have escaped with our lives and those of our children. Our

reputations are not dimmed, neither has the Lord forsaken us. The best

of our fortune remains with us. An honourable foundation remains on

which we can re-erect our future structure. Let us thank a wise,

over-ruling providence that a fortune still remains to us, though we

have passed through great misfortune."


    CHAPTER III.


    ARRIVES OFF FORT FREDERICK—PAUL GUIDON.


After the arrival of the sloop at the mouth of the St. John, the Captain

was compelled to leave his wife and family. There was not a morsel of

food of any description in the locker. The necessaries that had been

supplied by Crabtree for the voyage were entirely consumed.


The day following the arrival off Fort Frederick, Captain Godfrey set

sail in his small boat for Passmaquaddy, eighteen leagues distant. The

boat was the same one in which he accomplished his successful journey to

Annapolis Royal. His intention in setting out for Passmaquaddy was to

visit a settlement belonging to a Lieutenant of the Royal Navy, and

there procure some supplies for his family, and sails and rigging for

the sloop.


He left his family in a most destitute condition, they having neither

shoes nor stockings to their feet, and every other article of their

clothing being in rags and tatters. While the Captain was absent, his

wife and family were obliged to traverse the shore seeking for small

fish, which they were sometimes fortunate in securing. The second

evening after Captain Godfrey had left for Lieut. Owen's settlement,

being a clear, moonlight one in June, Mrs. Godfrey thought she saw an

object floating leisurely down the river in the direction of the sloop.

She went below and brought on deck one of the old muskets which did such

valuable service at Grimross. Charlie, her twelve-year old son, said to

his mother: "Do you see Indians?" The little fellow was so agitated he

could scarcely speak. She cautioned her son to remain perfectly quiet,

and not to utter another word. Brave, calm, unmoved, she stood over her

boy at the bow of the sloop. On the nearer approach of the object she

discovered it was a canoe, with someone leisurely paddling it along. It

had almost drifted by the vessel when, to her surprise, it suddenly

turned, and ran straight as an arrow for the side of the sloop.


Mrs Godfrey, in a loud, firm tone, sang out:


"Pull away, or I'll shoot you!"


The canoe was turned about in an instant, and as quick came floating

over the water the words:


"Me, Paul: Me, Paul Guidon!"


She threw him a small line and then invited him to come on board,

immediately resuming her former position with the musket by her side.


The Indian came on board, fastened his frail bark and stood for a moment

watching the retreating tide. Mrs. Godfrey asked him to come forward,

while little Charlie was shaking as though he would fall in pieces. He

obeyed her, and stepped forward. She took him by the hand and said:


"Paul! Paul! You have again come to see me. I have thought of you,

prayed for you, and shall never forget you. You have saved my life and

the lives of my husband and dear children. I am in great trouble; God

has sent you again."


Paul Guidon stood speechless and motionless with his sparkling black

eyes fixed on her thin, pale hand. The mild effulgence of the lunar

light shone full upon his face, bringing out every feature in perfect

outline. Presently his whole frame shook as though it had received an

electric shock. Mrs. Godfrey looked straight at him with her piercing

black eyes from the moment he had stood before her. Her power over him

seemed like that of a charmer. Her magic nature had completely overcome

him. Never did a naval hero appear on deck after a victory more

transcendently grand than did Margaret Godfrey at that moment of her

life. She pressed his hand more closely and said: "Paul, are you ill?"

He replied by placing her soft, white hand upon his throbbing breast,

and then moved toward the canoe. He spoke not a word. He pointed towards

his canoe, and made a sign with his right hand from the eastern horizon

up the semicircle of the sky. She understood it to mean that he would

return in the morning, at the rising of the sun. He at once got into his

canoe, and in a minute or two was paddling up the stream against the

rushing tide.


Very early the following morning, Margaret was on deck preparing to go

on shore while the tide was low, and, if possible, catch some fish for

breakfast. She had not been long on deck before she saw a canoe

approaching. As it neared the sloop she saw that Paul Guidon was its

only occupant. In a few minutes Paul was on board, looking as bright as

the morning star. Margaret bade him good morning and then related to him

the distressed condition of herself and children. He replied, with a

cheerful smile: "Suppose big boy and little ones go with Paul and catch

'em some fish?" She felt that the Indian had a kind heart and at once

consented to accompany him with her children. All got into the canoe,

and Paul at once began to paddle down the river. Although the morning

was without rain the sky was leaden, and the atmosphere heavy and damp.

As the Indian paddled the canoe along for a couple of miles, all on

board were joyous and seemed refreshed as they drank in the breeze from

off the breast of the bay.


They landed at a point of land, or rather of rocks, where Paul succeeded

in catching several fish, which he placed in the bottom of the canoe. He

then proposed to leave the place and proceed further down the shore.

Margaret replied that occasionally drops of rain fell upon her face, and

she feared a storm might suddenly spring up and bar their way back to

the vessel. She rather urged the Indian to return, but she saw by his

manner that he was inclined to demur to her solicitation. He said there

was a brook a short distance further down the shore, where there was

always plenty of good fish. Mrs. Godfrey finally consented to follow

Paul. He took in his arms the two smallest children, and pressing them

closely to his broad chest with his long sinewy arms, was soon skipping

from rock to rock like a mountain goat. The mother and the three other

children followed as closely as possible in Paul's tracks.


After the Indian had gone about a hundred yards, he looked over his left

shoulder and appeared satisfied that all was well. He redoubled his

speed and bounded along as a deer, and suddenly turning to the right he

made his way up a slope of ground and was out of sight among the trees.


Margaret now began to feel anxious, fearing that after all the trust she

had reposed in Paul, he might yet prove unfaithful. She called to the

Indian, but he heeded not her cry. She again called, but he had

completely disappeared.


Under such circumstances a less brave woman would have sunk on the spot

in utter despair. She kept on, following as nearly as she could the

track that Paul had taken. She toiled on and on for three quarters of an

hour, but never sighted the Indian. At last she completely lost the

trail. The rocks and uneven ground impeded her progress, and the trees

confused her in the line of march. All traces of a pathway were lost.


She sat down on a large boulder—the children wanted rest, they were

completely fatigued. She judged that they must be nearly two miles from

the canoe. In her distressed situation she contemplated returning to the

shore. To proceed further in the direction she had been going seemed

hopeless. Without a guide she and her children would certainly get lost,

and likely all would perish. Whilst she was thus debating in her mind

what course to pursue, a peel of thunder passed over her head, and large

drops of rain began to fall. The wind suddenly sprang up, and all around

her was growing dark. Her blood quickened in its pulsations, as the

elements were increasing the difficulties of her position. Alone, on a

rocky, stormy shore, with three small children and two others far away

in the arms of an almost unknown savage, what could she do? Where could

she go? She said to herself: "evil seems to follow me closely, and heavy

trouble is continually weighing me down. I am in a strange land, among a

strange race; where will the end be? It may be here." As the above

thoughts were running through her brain, a brilliant flash of lightning

streamed close by her pale face, and for an instant lit up the earth and

sea around. A tree, a few feet distant, was shattered by the flash. Her

children trembled as the thunder shook the solid ground. She delayed no

longer, but determined at once to start back in the direction of the

canoe, and taking each of the smaller children by the hand, with Charlie

following, she pointed for the shore.


The rain descended in torrents; the thunder roared, and the lightning

flashed. Through the terrible storm Mrs. Godfrey pressed on, buoyant

with a hope that all might turn out well. As she was staggering from

rock to rock with the little ones pitching and stumbling along at her

sides, now and again almost blinded and bewildered by the lurid

lightning, she felt as one amid the crash of worlds.


Just as she sighted the canoe, which Paul had hauled upon the shore, a

sharp, rattling clap of thunder peeled above her head. This was preceded

an instant before by a dazzling blue and golden flash that all but

blinded the band of wanderers. Another and another flash, followed by

their thunderbolts, in quick succession shattered a solid rock over

which they had just passed. The whole shore appeared to tremble and

crash, and away far out over the surface of the bay the waters seemed as

if in a blaze. The sight was grand and terrible. Every rock along the

shore appeared to sink into an abyss as the lightning passed by, and

many of them were riven. At length Mrs. Godfrey and her children reached

the side of the canoe. There calm and unmoved amid the storm, she knelt,

she wept, she prayed. The waters of Fundy were heaped into angry

billows, and dashed their spray over the mother and children assembled

round the altar on the shore. Darkness began to throw its sable mantle

over land, rocks and bay. Margaret was suddenly started, she thought she

heard the sound of a voice coming through the gloom. She turned her head

in the direction of the sound, and at that moment a flash of lightning

revealed a human form coming toward her. In an instant it was lost to

view, shut out in the darkness. "Me come!" "Me come!" fell upon her

waiting ears. Margaret, with a heart overflowing with gratitude and

swelling with praise, quietly exclaimed "God is love." Paul stood before

her, panting like a stricken deer, with but one of the children in his

arms. As Margaret looked at him her pale face turned ashen white, her

lips quivered and she fell into the arms of Paul Guidon as if dead. He

sat down upon a rock, and by the lightning's flash bathed her temples

with water from the sea shore. The Indian continued to pour salt water

out of his brawny hands upon her head and neck. In about ten minutes

Margaret was restored to consciousness. When she opened her eyes her

missing child was at her side. Paul Guidon had placed the little fellow

in charge of an Indian he had found fishing on the bank of the stream,

and he asked him to take the child in his arms and follow on to the

shore.


After Paul had been fishing along the stream for some time, seeing that

Mrs. Godfrey and her children had not come up with him, he decided to

return and look them up.


As they rested together on the shore beside their birchen boat, the

thunder gradually died away, and there was also a truce to the lightning

and rain. In two hours from the time of the happy reunion of the loved

and lost the water became quite calm. Paul Guidon then launched the

canoe and the little ships' company were soon heading toward the mouth

of the St. John. In another hour and a half Paul and his companion had

safely paddled Margaret Godfrey and her children to the sloop.


Margaret's first act, after reaching her small floating home, was to

place each child upon its knees, doing likewise herself. As her clear

voice rang out over the water, conveying words of thankfulness to Him

whom winds and seas obey, the two Indians sank slowly on their knees.


Plenty of fish had been secured by Paul to last the family some days

Margaret cooked the supper, Paul and his companion ate heartily, then

left the sloop and proceeded in the canoe to their homes, Paul promising

to return the next day with a load of wood to replenish the stock of

fuel which was well nigh exhausted.


At seven o'clock next morning Paul again was seen sailing along toward

the sloop, his little bark skimming over the river like a petrel on the

ocean's breast. He appeared anxious and excited as he approached the

side of the vessel. He had but a few pieces of wood in his canoe.

Margaret at first sight noticed a change in his features; he looked worn

and weary. His bright black eye had lost much of its fire, and as he

stepped on board Mrs. Godfrey thought she noticed a tear on his cheek.

As usual she saluted him and asked him on board, and as he stepped over

the rail she took his hand in her own. This act of kindness on the part

of Margaret seemed to electrify his whole frame. She said to him, "And

how is Paul this morning." Without answering her he placed his hand on

his left breast and sighed deeply. "Is my Paul ill this morning," she

again asked, thinking that the strain from carrying the children the day

previous, and the worry and excitement, had been too severe a task even

upon the hardy and wiry frame of the Iroquois. "No! No!" he replied,

"but," "but," and here he stopped being too full to utter another word.

He pointed to his canoe, and then pointed up the river past the fort.

She guessed his meaning. It was to return to his home at once.


Margaret said to him, "Paul do you want me and the children to go with

you?"


He bowed an assent.


All hands were soon on board the canoe and in a few strokes of the

paddle the homeless emigrants were sailing toward the rapids. The tide

was running up and the long sinewy arms of Paul, as he plied the paddle,

made the little bark fairly leap along. The rippling of the water was

all that broke in upon the stillness of the morning.


The steep, rugged country on either side the mouth of the St. John was

dressed in deepest green, tall and noble trees lined both banks. The

clear bright sky and the brighter sun made the river appear like a

winding stream of silver with borders of emerald. Her admiration of

natural beauty, she had herself confessed more than once during the

voyage to Grimross.


While Mrs. Godfrey was drinking in the beauties of the scenery, and

meditating on the loneliness that reigned supreme among the hills, the

canoe touched the shore. As Margaret stepped from the little bark to the

shore, a large grey snake passed athwart her pathway and disappeared

into a hole at the roots of a tree. She felt much concerned at this

circumstance, as in Ireland, her native land, it was a common belief

among the people that if a snake passed across a persons track without

being killed by the traveller, some evil was close upon his or her

track.


After the Indian had pulled the canoe out of the water, he led the way

up a slight incline, followed by Margaret and her children. They had

walked some two hundred yards over uneven ground and among trees, when

Paul suddenly stopped and then stepped off to the right, and beckoned to

those in his rear to follow him. A few steps brought the visitors in

sight of a wigwam. It was situated in a small open space, surrounded by

a dense forest of large, tall trees. In a minute or two all stood at the

opening in the camp.


Paul seemed to hesitate as he led the way inside. He removed an old

blanket which was hanging over the aperture. Opposite the entrance on

the further side of the camp lay a human form stretched on some old grey

blankets, that were spread over branches of spruce trees. The Indian

approached the bed and then stooped down and kissed its occupant, and

then beckoned to Margaret Godfrey to step forward. She at once obeyed.

To her astonishment there lay an old squaw with sunken cheeks and eyes.

Over her form was stretched a time-worn grey blanket, and on it laid a

wampum belt, and a string of wampum beads, an old plaid shawl supported

her head.


Margaret thought that she recognized the shawl as one she had brought

with her from Ireland, and wondered how it came there. She knelt down,

and placing her arm under the old squaw's neck, gently raised her head a

few inches. The poor old squaw tried to speak but was too weak to do so.

Margaret took the withered hand of the Indian woman and placed it in her

own. On one of the bony fingers of the squaw was a ring which fell off

into Margaret's hand. Margaret recognized it as a ring she had often

seen. She asked Paul who the sick woman was. "She is my poor old

mother," he replied, "she has been sick long time, since last winter,

got bad fall and almost stiffened with cold." "She fast going away from

her Paul." Margaret noticed the old woman's lips moving, she put her ear

close to the squaw's mouth and heard her say in a whisper, "Me Mag!"

Mrs. Godfrey, completely surprised, laid her head upon the dying woman's

bed. The shawl, a red and black plaid, she had given old Mag at

Grimross. Now it was used for her dying pillow. The old Indian woman

fairly worshipped it in her days of health and strength. And the ring

was also presented to old Mag while a prisoner at Grimross. The

afternoon that old Mag was given the ring was one never to be forgotten

by Mrs. Godfrey. The old Iroquois squaw on that occasion danced the war

dance on the kitchen floor, so great was her joy in receiving the

precious gem.


Margaret asked Paul where he had found his mother on his return from the

setting sun. He then related to her in broken English the following

story:—


He had returned from his hunting expedition on the evening of the day

the house at Grimross had been consumed by the flames. He had been

detained with the officers one month longer than he expected to be when

he left home. On his arrival home he found that his mother was missing.

He made inquiries as to her whereabouts, and was told that she had gone

off with three Indians named Nick Thoma, Pete Paul, and Christopher

Cope, to trade furs for some pork, blankets and powder at Grimross. That

white woman had killed the three Indians; that white man's house was

burnt, and white woman had put his mother into the flames and burnt her

up. Early in the morning after his arrival home he set out for Grimross

Neck, crossing the lake where the sloop lay. When he arrived at Grimross

he saw nothing but blackened ruins, and was convinced the Indian's story

was true. He saw also the dead bodies of the three Indians, he could not

recognize them, they were so cooked by the fire. He walked about the

ruins, almost bewildered, and swearing vengeance. Not many steps from

where the house had stood were dense woods. He wandered in among the

trees scarcely knowing where he was going, when to his surprise he saw

his mother sitting down on the snow with her back resting against a

large tree, her feet and knees covered with blankets. He pulled off one

blanket, then another, and yet another, but his mother never moved. She

sat as motionless as the tree itself. Her face was covered with frozen

blood. He took hold of her shoulders and shook her when she appeared to

breathe. After rubbing her hands and beating her feet on the frozen snow

for a long time she began to move her limbs. And finally he got her to

stand on her feet. Her eyes were swollen and completely closed. He was

at a loss to know how he was to get her to the camp twelve miles

distant. Part of the journey was comparatively easy; they could go by

way of the lake. At four o'clock he started with his mother for the

camp, she could only walk slowly and with great difficulty. They made

many stops on the way and reached the camp long after midnight. About

noon the next day the old woman had gained sufficient strength to tell

her story. She said "she went first time with Indians to trade furs at

Grimross. Indians were very savage and blood-thirsty. Broke in door of

house, white woman fired gun, they all ran away. She was captured after

falling down bank. She was taken to house of English people and

afterwards treated like one of the family. A lot of Indians came back

second time about last of winter, few days ago broke into the house of

English people and set it on fire. The English woman fired two guns and

killed three Indians. The rest of Indians ran away. When gun was fired

and house burning, was afraid English woman would kill her. As soon as

could get over dead Indians in door, ran away among trees, and was

frightened to come out again till all pale faces went away. Felt very

cold when pale faces went away, wandered back to burnt house, found the

blankets, returned with them to woods, got down against tree, put

blankets over feet and legs, and remember no more till my Paul woke me

next day."


As Paul Guidon related his mother's story his face was bathed in tears.

Mrs. Godfrey attentively listened, and at the same time carefully

watched every feature of old Mag's face. When Paul had finished his

mother's story, Margaret Godfrey gently raised old Mag's head, and

bending over it said, "Poor old Mag this is indeed you." The dying

Indian woman tried in vain to move her lips, while her body seemed

convulsed. She then stretched herself out at full length and a slight

tremor passed over her frame, her chin dropped.


Mrs. Godfrey looked up at Paul, who was standing at the foot of the bed,

and remarked, "Paul your dear old mother is gone, forever gone." The

Indian without replying then threw himself upon the bed and lay

motionless beside the body of his mother. In a short time he began to

weep and moan, which he continued to do so long and piteously, that

Margaret thought his sorrowing heart would burst. At last completely

exhausted with grief he remained quiet and passive as though his spirit

too had passed over to the green fields and still waters of the

everlasting hunting grounds.


Margaret gazed upon the quiet features and still form of the handsome

young Iroquois, he was in the vigour of his manhood, being scarcely

twenty-four years old; and said, as she admired his manly look, "Paul,

your mother is happier now;" "she is in that land where trials, trouble

and death are unknown. You must live to meet her there. Your mother is

now sailing on silvery water; breathing an atmosphere perfumed with

celestial spices; and sitting in a canoe made from the bark of trees

growing on the shores of Canaan's stream. Her wigwam will be made of the

same kind of bark and ornamented with pearls and precious stones. She

will wear a neck-lace of jewels and on her head will be a crown of

glory."


Paul, weary and sad, went to his canoe, launched it and sailed down the

river to catch some fish for supper, and Mrs. Godfrey proceeded to

prepare the body of old Mag for burial, while the children played around

the wigwam. When the Indian had returned he found all that remained of

his mother neatly prepared for the grave.


The black and red plaid shawl was wound round and round the body from

head to feet, no part being visible but the face. Margaret had fastened

the shawl at the throat with a silver brooch. Old Mag, as she lay upon

the camp bed, resembled a dead Highlander. Arrangements were made for

the funeral, and Paul paddled Mrs. Godfrey and children to the sloop and

then returned to dig his mother's grave. Next morning Paul came down to

the sloop looking very sad. He said that he had not closed his eyes

during the night. He sat watching through the long night at the side of

his dead parent.


Many of us have heard and read accounts of lonely scenes and lonely

spots, but what place could be more lonely and what scene more solemn

than that of a lone Indian sitting beside the corpse of his mother in a

Nova Scotian forest a hundred and twenty years ago, through the dread

hours of a whole night?


What thoughts passed through the brain of Paul Guidon during the weird

hours of that night, it may be, will be revealed in eternity.


Mrs. Godfrey and her children again went with Paul to the abode of

death. After landing, Margaret accompanied the Indian to inspect the

place of burial. It was situated on the bank of a small stream running

down to the river, and about two hundred yards from the camp. The grave

looked like the newly made nest of some huge bird. It was cleanly dug

and neatly lined with evergreens. In this grave the body of old Mag was

placed as the sun was sinking below the horizon. It was conveyed to its

last resting place by Paul, Margaret and her son Charlie; the four

younger children forming the procession.


None of the Indians of the tribes of the St. John were present at the

burial, as Paul had not circulated the news of his mother's death.


Mrs. Godfrey read, from the old service book, the Church of England

burial service, the most beautiful of all burial services, that of the

Masonic brethren perhaps excepted.


Mrs. Godfrey and Charlie filled in the grave. When they returned to the

wigwam all within was darkness and gloom. Margaret and her children were

paddled to the sloop by Paul. He was invited to spend the night on board

the little vessel, but declined to do so. Margaret then took him by the

hand, and, as she drew him toward her, he placed his hand upon her

shoulders and cried aloud, "Mother!" "Mother!" She led him to the canoe,

he got into his little bark and was soon sailing away towards his lonely

dwelling-place, where it may have been the spirit of old Mag kept watch

that night over the wigwam and her boy.


    CHAPTER IV.


    TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AT SEA.


Captain Godfrey arrived safely at Passmaquaddy and was warmly welcomed.


He was supplied with sails, rigging and a general outfit for his family,

and he was sent back to the mouth of the St. John in a much larger and

more convenient boat, bringing the smaller boat in tow. He was absent

twelve days.


The day previous to the Captain's return Paul Guidon had visited the

sloop, but Margaret could only prevail upon him to remain for a few

minutes. He said something wanted him back at the wigwam. He appeared to

be impressed by some invisible and irresistible power to return at once

to the sad camping ground.


"Me: Paul!" he said to Margaret, "cannot stay long away from camp and my

mother's grave." "Happy mother must be in the woods near wigwam."


As far as Mrs. Godfrey could learn from the lone Indian his thoughts

were something like the following:—


All the birds that used to sing so sweetly around the little birchen

home and gaily fluttered from branch to branch, seemed to sit quietly

and pour out their songs in mornful strains, and all about the spot the

wind appeared to whistle a requiem for the departed squaw. And in the

long and quiet hours of the darkness, he felt certain that old Mag's

spirit left the woods, and in never ceasing motion kept watch about the

camp, and at regular intervals would pass within and kiss him when

asleep.


The Indian from his habits of life, skimming in his canoe over the

lonely and wooded river, or skipping from rock to rock on the lonely

mountain side; in tracing the border of the roaring cataract, in

pitching his tent along the edge of the flowing river or the sleeping

lake; out on the prairie or in the midst of the dense forest; among the

trees on the ocean shore, is most deeply impressed with the belief that

the Great Chief is watching his actions from behind trees, out of the

surface of the waters, from the tops of the mountains, and out of the

bosom of the prairie. He thinks that the lightning is His spear, and the

thunder His voice. He feels that a terrible something is all around him,

and when death calls any of his tribe away supreme superstition takes

firm hold of his very existence.


    "Lo, the poor Indian! whose untutored mind
    Sees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind."


The poet, and the highly imaginative person, the wise and the good, seek

the hills and the valleys, the dashing cataract, the forest and stream,

the mountain range, the rocky coast and roaring ocean, and there drink

in the grandeur of creation in those sublime scenes. In such places they

feel a nearness to the Creator, and view His power and handiwork in a

measure not always attainable in the ordinary scenes of everyday life.

Such persons admire with reverential awe the greatness of God and feel

His love.


The Indian, in superstitious dread, lives in ignorance of His greatness,

His ways and His love.


Paul Guidon visited the sloop the next morning, and Captain Godfrey

welcomed him on board and invited him to remain during the day and

assist in refitting the vessel. The Indian did not refuse in words to do

so, but his looks and movements plainly indicated his disinclination to

remain.


Margaret approached him and said, "Paul, you will stay with me and help

us get the vessel all ready to sail away, won't you?" He took her hand,

pressed it tightly, and then let it fall at her side. She knew she had

won him, and was well aware that she could lead him as a child.


He remained, and all were soon at work. The children picked over the

oakum, the Captain fitted the rigging, and the Indian and Mrs. Godfrey

tried their hands at making a mainsail.


At the setting of the sun Paul returned to his lonely home. The next

morning, before the sun had risen, he was once more on board the sloop.

The day was a lovely one, and similar work to that of the previous day

occupied the attention of all The following day the vessel was hauled to

high water mark on the island, there to be overhauled and caulked.

Captain Godfrey had brought a supply of necessary tools for the work

from Passmaquaddy. The Indian came down each morning from his wigwam and

assisted until the sloop was ready for sea, (The repairing of the little

vessel La Tour was probably the pioneer work of refitting and

repairing which a century later assumed such gigantic proportions on

both sides of the mouth of the St. John.) Mrs. Godfrey named the vessel

La Tour, because, she said, that was the original name of the fort

that sheltered herself and her children during Captain Godfrey's absence

at Annapolis Royal.


At length everything was ready, and the morning to weigh anchor came. A

stiff breeze blowing up the harbour caused a delay in sailing. The

morning was so wet, and the wind blew so hard, that Paul Guidon did not

venture out in his canoe, but he came down by land, and quite early in

the day stood upon the shore opposite where the sloop lay.


Margaret was first to notice him. She thought that she never saw him

look so handsome as when he stood on the right bank of the harbour that

morning. She called her husband, and pointing toward the shore said:

"Look at that noble form at the water's edge. It looks like a statue

standing on a line between the water and the woods!"


Captain Godfrey rowed to the shore and took Paul off to the sloop. He

remained on board but an hour, promising as he left to return in the

morning if the storm abated.


Captain Godfrey had decided to sail for Halifax via Passmaquaddy. The

morning was fine and the wind fair. Paul was on hand bright and early.

Margaret said to him, "Paul, in an hour we shall sail away from here,

and perhaps I shall never see you again on earth." These words seemed to

almost paralyze the Indian, and for a while he appeared unconscious of

everything that passed. His canoe was tied alongside the sloop. Captain

Godfrey hauled up the anchor. Margaret asked the Indian if he would go

with them as far as Passmaquaddy. He made no reply. He sat down on the

deck and covered his face with his hands. Captain Godfrey said to him

rather sternly, "Paul, we are now on our passage, if you are going to

leave take your canoe and go." He made no reply to the Captain. The

sloop was slipping down the harbour and had passed the lower island

before the Indian seemed to recognize his situation. He looked wildly

first at the shore, then on the other side at the great waters, and

burst into a flood of tears.


Margaret stepped to his side and said, "Paul, do you feel ill?"


He shook his head, and with his hand pointed at the vast waters of the

bay.


Margaret proceeded to get dinner, and the red man was left alone. Paul

was asked to the lunch, but replied not.


The sloop ran leisurely along the shore all day, the wind being light

and the water quite smooth. All were compelled to rest on deck during

the night, which was bright, and the moon made it almost like day,—the

little cabin was besieged with mosquitoes. About midnight the Indian,

who had not spoken since leaving the St. John, suddenly sprang to his

feet and peered over the moon-lit water in the direction of the shore.

Captain Godfrey, who was at the helm, seeing him, thought he was about

to make a plunge overboard, and called to his wife who was asleep. She

sprang up, asking what was the matter. At this moment Paul sang out,

"Indians coming." Margaret went to the cabin, got the musket and pointed

toward the canoes, three in number, and fired. The canoes soon after

disappeared in the direction of the shore. Paul sank back into his

former position, and in a short time all were asleep except the Captain

and the Indian. Nothing unusual occurred during the remainder of the

night, and in the morning, the wind growing stronger, the little ship

made greater headway. The day was a beautiful one, and Paul was as quiet

as usual. He ate nothing. Night again came on, and the breeze holding

through the moon-lit hours, the Captain ran the sloop into Passmaquaddy

early in the morning.


As the sun was rising in all his splendour, throwing his brightening

rays over land and water, the little vessel was headed into her port of

destination. As she was running in, Paul, quick as a flash, jumped up,

as though some attendant spirit had suddenly opened to him a vision of

the future. He fixed his eyes intently on the shore. In an instant he

crouched down on the deck with his head and shoulders partly over the

rail. His attitude and manner were those of a wild beast about to spring

upon its prey. The Captain thought Paul saw something strange on the

shore. In a few minutes the Indian sat down again, and for sometime

remained perfectly quiet. The anchor was let go, and the little craft

rested in Passmaquaddy harbour. The Captain ran in for the purpose of

getting some one to pilot the sloop to Halifax, but to his great

disappointment could find no one willing to go. He had neither money nor

goods to offer in payment for the service of a pilot.


The day following he set sail for Machias, ten leagues distant, in the

hope of securing some person at that place willing to assist him in the

passage to Halifax. Paul Guidon had consented to go as far as Machias,

and there land and make his way back to the St. John.


After leaving Passmaquaddy, Captain Godfrey concluded to put into Head

harbour and try his luck at that place in securing a pilot, but being

unacquainted with the locality he ran the sloop on a ledge of rocks.

However, the tide coming in she floated off unharmed.


    "Flung from the rock, on ocean's foam, to sail
    Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail."


The wind suddenly veered round and blew off shore quite fresh. The

vessel stood well off during the night, and the Captain hoped to make

the harbour sometime the next morning, but toward daylight a fog began

to settle down fast and thick. Captain Godfrey fully realized the

perilous position of all on board, but having been early trained in

seamanship, he had full confidence in his ability to manage the sloop.


In the morning land could not be seen. The fog continued for three days,

during which time (to use the Captain's words) "the situation was dismal

enough, and every moment I was expecting to see the craft drawn on the

rocks and all on board perish." The fourth day the fog was less dense,

and those on board could see for some distance, but the sun was

invisible, and the war of the elements was raging with increasing fury.

In the afternoon the wind had shifted to north-west and increased to a

partial gale. The sloop was running under a bit of mainsail; it seemed

at times as if the following seas would founder the little vessel as

they towered over the low rail. Nothing was to be seen but the wide

expanse of water. Not even a solitary gull. The Captain remarked to his

wife, "It is a curious fact that, excepting the petrels, sea birds keep

near to the land in bad weather." Captain Godfrey feared the night, and

as it came on the wind grew in strength. A terrible sea was running, and

all were fastened below excepting Paul and the Captain. The Indian would

not leave the deck, although more than once he was nearly washed

overboard. At length darkness covered the face of the ocean, and the

wind howled in all its fury. The seas were like mountains, tossing the

sloop about like a cork. Mrs. Godfrey would remain below no longer. She

told her children, who were tumbling like nine-pins about the cabin

floor, not to cry, as she would soon return to them. As she put her head

out of the companion way, the Captain ordered her back. She said, "Where

is Paul?" Her husband answered, "I have called to him time and time

again to get below." She called to Paul, who was holding fast to the

anchor chain with his legs stuck under the windlass. He did not answer.

She started to creep forward. Her husband could not see her. At this

moment the sloop took a dreadful plunge. A heavy sea swept over her from

stern to bow, completely submerging her. The Captain, who had taken the

precaution to lash himself to the deck, in a half-drowned state, held

steadily to the tiller. As soon as possible he called to his wife, but

no answer came back. He called to Paul, and he too was silent. Was she

lost? Had she, in whom all his hopes were placed, been carried into the

sea and for ever lost to him on earth? These thoughts bewildered him

while he was trying to steer his vessel. He dare not leave the helm to

look after his wife and children. He hoped the sea had not broken into

the cabin and drowned all that were left to him on earth. He had often

been called to drink the cup of bitterness, had he been called to drink

it to its dregs? Had his sorrow at last reached its destined depths. He

burst into tears, almost stupified, and calling upon Him who is able to

guide the storm in its course and hush it to a calm; to Him whose

charities have distilled like the dews of Heaven; who had fed the hungry

and clothed the naked; who had opened a way of escape in the wilderness;

to Him he cried for succor. And at last in utter despair he earnestly

prayed for morning or death. Now and again a huge sea would break over

the little ship, but she rode the waves as beautifully as an ocean

liner. Terribly the night wore away. With the dawn of the morning the

gale began to abate. The Captain lashed the tiller and crept to the

companion way. He opened it, went down, found his children, bruised,

bleeding and terrified. He kissed them, feeling they were now dearer

than ever to him. They asked him where their mother was. He came on deck

and shut them in the cabin without replying. As Captain Godfrey crawled

to his position at the helm, he said to himself, my dear children have

escaped the arrow and tomahawk, the flames at Grimross, the thunder,

lightning and tempest, and even yet they are safe. If it were not for my

children I would prefer to sleep here in death rather than live

elsewhere. I would be near my wife to share a part with her in the

resurrection.


While the Captain was thus mournfully musing, a faint light began to

creep around the eastern horizon. He was so absorbed in thought and in

watching every movement of the sloop that he did not notice the

increasing light. There were rifts in the dark clouds, and the air was

growing moist. The morning light brought with it rain. The sea gradually

grew less and less troubled, and the little vessel rolled and pitched

more easily. The Captain was suddenly startled from his reverie by the

increasing rays of the rising sun, who was now beginning to show his

golden circle above the horizon. He made fast the tiller and went

forward to see what damage had been done through the night. The jib had

been snugly furled before darkness set in. As he stepped forward of the

mainsail, to his great surprise he saw two human forms wedged in under

the windlass and locked in each other's arms. They were tightly wedged

to their knees, between the windlass and the deck. Mrs. Godfrey's

clothes were torn in shreds. She lay with her head across the Indian's

shoulders, her arms were tightly locked around his neck and flowing

black hair.


The Captain had on board the sloop an old axe, which he at once got and

commenced to cut the windlass from its fastenings. A piece of the wood

flew and struck his wife on the leg, he thought he the saw the limb,

which was partially bare, tremble. He then threw his whole strength into

his work, and in a few minutes had the satisfaction of seeing one end of

the windlass loosened. He took hold of the unfastened end and with a

sudden jerk wrenched the other end from its socket. He then rubbed his

wife's limb with his open palm, and soon felt it growing warm. In a few

minutes she breathed quickly, and appeared to grasp her swarthy

companion more tightly. She moaned, and then opened her eyes and stared

vacantly at her husband, who almost fainted with joy. He turned his wife

over, and pulled the shreds of clothing towards her feet. He then went

to the cabin and got a bottle containing brandy, presented to him during

his first visit to Passmaquaddy. He poured out a spoonful, and forced it

down his wife's throat. Soon after she spoke, and asked her husband to

raise her up. As he did so she said, "give some brandy to Paul, he

cannot be dead, if I am alive." Paul all this time had never stirred. He

lay like a fallen statue, brown and stiff. Margaret brushed the coarse

black hair from off his face. Captain Godfrey opened the Indian's jaws

and put a spoonful of brandy into his mouth. His muscles began to

quiver, he trembled, he breathed, he moaned, and again relapsed into

perfect quietness. Margaret sat beside Paul while the Captain went to

jibe the mainsail and port the helm. She thrust her hand beneath his

torn shirt and laid it over his heart. She felt its weak pulsations. She

then ran her hand around and over his swarthy skin; she felt it growing

warm. He moaned and moved. She continued the application of her hand,

his eyelids opened, he trembled all over, and looked up at Margaret in a

sort of amazed stare. At length the Indian completely recovered his

senses, and by this time Margaret Godfrey again became exhausted. She

was carried to the dingy little cabin by her husband and her son

Charlie. Paul was so weak that he could not raise himself from the

deck. The Captain moved him a few feet and lashed him to the mast.

Neither Margaret nor the Indian were able to move from their resting

places till late in the afternoon.


Captain Godfrey judged the sloop to be well across the Bay of Fundy, and

he determined to make all speed possible for the town of Halifax. The

wind was fair, and all the reefs in the sails were shaken out. For the

next two days the weather was fine and the wind fair, and Margaret and

Paul were regaining their strength. Nothing of an unusual character

occurred on board. Since the jam under the windlass, Paul Guidon

appeared more lively and conversed more freely. About four o'clock in

the afternoon of the second day after the storm, while the Indian was

sitting at the bow of the sloop, a school of porpoises was seen

approaching in as regular order as a company of British soldiers to a

charge. When the fish had approached to within a hundred yard's of the

sloop, the Indian threw up his hands and uttered a most mournful wail,

and staggered backward. Captain Godfrey rushed forward and caught Paul

as he was falling overboard. Both fell athwart the rail and all but into

the sea.


The Indian, who had not recovered sufficient strength to endure much

excitement or hardship, was in a high state of feverish bewilderment.

The Captain said: "Paul, what gave you such a fright?" He replied, "that

when he first saw the fish approaching, he thought that they were a lot

of canoes paddled by evil spirits from the dark, dismal hunting grounds

of thieving and murderous Indians, and that they were after him to carry

him away over the great waters to live in misery among them, because he

had left the wigwam and forsaken his mother's grave before two moons

were gone."


Early next morning Mrs. Godfrey relieved her husband at the helm;

Charlie assisting her. The Captain went below to rest, asking to be

called if anything out of the ordinary occurred. He had hardly closed

his eyes during the voyage, but fell asleep at his post during the

previous night, when the weather fortunately was fine and the sea quite

peaceful.


At about ten o'clock, a.m., Paul sighted something in the distance. He

called to Mrs. Godfrey to look in the direction of his hand, which he

was pointing over the port bow. She could see nothing, but she headed

the sloop in the direction that Paul gave, and in an hour's time had the

satisfaction of seeing what she supposed to be the outline of rocks or

land. She kept the vessel headed in toward what she supposed to be land,

and at three o'clock called her husband on deck. The Captain judged his

vessel to be on the east coast of Nova Scotia.


Margaret called her children around her, and asked Paul to sit down with

them. She opened the old service book and read a portion of scripture.

The deck was made an altar of the living God. From the deck fervent

prayer mingled with the voice of the ocean and with the sighing wind

ascended on high. Margaret said to Paul: "You and I were rescued at the

gate of death. When our frail bark was tossing and labouring hard for

life in her lone path over the surging billows and through the blackness

of the night, a kind hand overshadowed us and kept us, and now not one

of the ship's company is lost."


Full of bright hope, she turned to her husband and said: "I now am

satisfied we shall safely reach port, and once again we and our dear

ones shall see our native lands. English civilization and English

justice will do rightly by us in our misfortunes. We, who have lost all

our possessions,—in an hour stripped of all that we owned,—and have

been compelled to endure hardships and face death itself in an English

colony, may in confidence look to the old land for succor."


The next two days the wind continued favourable, and the little vessel

ran along in sight of the coast.


The following day an adverse wind blew and a storm seemed brewing, but

the wind only freshened a bit, and all day the vessel beat about in

sight of land. Paul, who had now sufficiently recovered, appeared to

take a great interest in everything about the sloop; the sun shone

brightly and the clouds were lifted high in the heavens. All around was

perfect peace.


The Indian remarked to Captain Godfrey: "This not so good as canoe on

stream, or roaming hunting ground. Wide, big, great sea, would make

splendid hunting ground if only covered with grass and trees."


Early the next morning a King's schooner was sighted. The wind shifting,

Captain Godfrey ran the sloop into Petite Passage and anchored. The

King's schooner came to an anchor about the same time—a league distant.

Captain Spry, (Captain and pilot) of the King's schooner, sent a

messenger on board the sloop, who inquired where they had come from and

whither they were bound. After the messenger had returned to the King's

schooner, Lieutenant Knight of the Royal Navy, commander of the

schooner, sent a boat to the sloop with three men to assist Captain

Godfrey to Halifax, also some tea, chocolate, coffee, sugar, wine and

rum, bread, pork and flour. Captain Spry took the sloop under convoy.

The vessels put into several harbours; and the night before they arrived

at Halifax Captain Spry's schooner was lost sight of in a thick fog. The

fog lifted during the night, when they were able to see Halifax lights,

but on entering the harbour the sloop ran foul of a ledge of rocks

called "Two Sisters." The sea was running very high. Destruction seemed

on every hand. Fortunately a passage was perceived between the rocks. At

last they succeeded in getting through the passage, and came to anchor

before morning opposite the town of Halifax. Captain Godfrey and his

wife, after a long and eventful passage from Fort Frederick, found

themselves once again at Halifax, worn out and almost disheartened. The

new men on board the sloop appeared to admire Paul Guidon, and Paul took

kindly to them.


Shortly after their arrival at Halifax Captain Godfrey admitted to

Lieutenant Knight, that during the terrible storm in the mouth of the

Bay of Fundy, he expected every moment to see the sloop founder and all

on board perish in the ocean.


    CHAPTER V.


    CAPT. GODFREY AND LORD WM. CAMPBELL.—YOUNG LION OF THE WOODS.


Shortly after the arrival of the sloop at Halifax, Capt. Godfrey waited

on Lord William Campbell, at that time (the summer of 1771) Governor of

the Provinces.


His Lordship received him in the most cordial and gentlemanly manner,

and remarked that he would be pleased to order an investigation into his

case and have the Indians who committed the outrage ordered down from

the St. John river.


On September 2nd, 1771, a council met and an investigation took place.

Letters and affidavits were produced, sworn to before Plato Denny and

William Isherwood, Justices of the Peace for Campo Bello, where Lewis

LeBlond, a Canadian, made oath, that he was told by Lewis Neptune, an

Indian, that Captain Godfrey was to be burned out by Chief Pére Thomas'

orders, and that other Indians of the St. John tribe were to perform the

deed.


An affidavit was made by Gervase Say, an inhabitant of Gage township,

sworn to before Francis Peabody, Justice of the Peace, in which it was

stated that John Baptiste Caltpate, an Indian of the St. John tribe, had

declared to him that Francis DeFalt, an Indian belonging to Pére

Thomas' tribe, set fire to Captain Godfrey's house and store at

Grimross.


A schedule of the Captain's losses, attested before one of His Majesty's

Justices of the Peace at Halifax, was also laid before the council. The

reader will not be troubled with the items, suffice it to say the

losses, including lands, amounted to seven thousand four hundred and

sixty-two pounds.


His Excellency, finding that Captain Godfrey had acted conformably to

the rules and regulations of the Province, returned to him his bond that

he had given the government for carrying on a legitimate trade with the

Indians.


He was also satisfied that the Captain's losses were on account of the

action of the savages, and being fully convinced of the great hardships

and privations the Captain and his distressed wife and family had

undergone, he was pleased to give him an honourable clearance out of the

province, according to the regulations of said province, and also to

recommend him to the protection of the Right Honourable the Earl of

Hillsborough, at that time first Lord of Trade and Plantations for

public relief. The Governor had it not in his power to grant Captain

Godfrey any suitable gratuity for the great loss he had sustained.


  COPY OF LORD CAMPBELL'S LETTER TO LORD HILLSBOROUGH.


  HALIFAX, October 9th, 1771.


My Lord:


  The gentleman who will deliver this to you was lately a Captain in the

  52nd Regiment of foot, and came out to this province in August, 1769,

  with his wife and a large family, to settle on some lands on river St.

  John, which he had purchased before he left Europe, with a view of

  carrying on trade with the Indians. I have frequent complaints of those

  Indians since Fort Frederick, situate on the entrance of the St. John

  river, has been dismantled, and the garrison, which consisted of an

  officer's command, reduced to a corporal and four.


  The Fort, when properly garrisoned, kept the Indians of that district in

  pretty good order, but not so effectively by situation as it would if it

  had been constructed higher up the river, and as now the fort is

  entirely dismantled, I beg leave to offer to your Lordship's

  consideration whether a strong Block House, properly garrisoned, might

  not prove a proper check upon the insolence of the savages, at the same

  time it would afford a secure protection to a very increasing settlement

  on the banks of the river St. John, a situation abounding with most

  excellent soil, which produces the most valuable timber of all sorts in

  the province.


  These are considerations which I beg your Lordship will please to submit

  to His Majesty's advisers. The unhappy state of Mr. Godfrey's

  misfortunes will, I am persuaded, speak everything in his favour with

  your Lordship, which his past services or present suffering can entitle

  him to.


  I have the honour to be,

  Yours, &c., &c.,


  WM. CAMPBELL.
The Earl of Hillsborough.


After remaining at Halifax for five months, an opportunity offered for

Captain Godfrey to leave for England. He sailed with his wife and family

in the brigantine "Adamante," William Macniel, master, on the twentieth

day of December, 1771. Paul Guidon remained at Halifax about six weeks

after he had arrived with the Godfreys. While at Halifax he was much

admired by the officers of the army, and those of the navy paid him

even greater attentions. Margaret had circulated the report that the

Indian was of the Iroquois tribe, and as brave a man as ever drew a bow.

He wanted for nothing. He was dined and wined by the citizens generally.


The Governor took a deep interest in him, and secured a vast amount of

information from him respecting the character and movements of the

Indians on the St. John. One of the officers of the navy presented him

with a complete suit of navy-blue clothes, and an officer of the

garrison fitted him out with a second-hand undress military suit.


In his blue suit his appearance was most commanding. It suited his

complexion to a charm. He was straight as an arrow, and looked as

graceful as an elm. His frame was wiry; his limbs long and straight. He

would bound over the rails of the ships like a deer. His step was long,

quick and elastic, and he would run like a greyhound. His long black

hair, reaching down to his slender waist, seemed to make his broad

square shoulders doubly broad as it hung over his blue coat. But the

Indian, while he appeared to enjoy his new mode of life, was not always

happy or at ease. A sudden expression of sadness would often flit across

his features. He would roam for hours all alone in the woods. He often

longed for his canoe, which was washed overboard in the mouth of the Bay

of Fundy. He would often inquire of Captain Godfrey when he would get

back to his home on the St. John.


The time at last arrived when Paul Guidon was to depart. The King's

schooner was soon to sail for Passmaquaddy. Captain Godfrey, his wife

and children went on board the schooner to bid Paul farewell. They found

it hard to do so, especially Mrs. Godfrey. Paul Guidon had no idea that

he was to be separated from the family he loved. He thought they were

going to return to the St. John soon again.


As the Godfreys left the side of the King's schooner to return to the

shore, the "Young Lion of the Woods," (for such was the name given to

the Iroquois by the naval officers at Halifax) would not let go of Mrs.

Godfrey's hand. He gently pulled her back and said, "I may never see you

again, I want to speak to you alone." They went into the cabin, and

there the Indian poured out the agonies of his soul. He spoke to

Margaret as follows (the words are given as he spoke them): "You 'member

evening Fort Frederick when pale face man 'way, me, Paul, saved your

life and children too? when Indians threw tomahawk, and fired arrows at

you? when you come out Fort, and one arrow struck you in arm?" Mrs.

Godfrey replied: "Paul, the mark of that arrow I shall carry with me to

the grave." The Indian continued: "You and children been all dead now

and buried near old Fort if Paul not been there; when you come out Fort,

after Indians threat to burn Fort and all up, me saw you like spirit

from some other land; you looked pale, and stood brave; you mind me put

hand up and told Indians stand back. Pale face and looked so brave,

saved life and in boat too. All squaws in woods none like you." Paul

then relapsed into silence, and his head dropped forward. He firmly held

Margaret Godfrey's hand all the time he was repeating the event at the

Fort, and her small white hand was frequently wet with tears as they

rolled off the swarthy face of the Indian.


At last she said: "Paul, I can stay here no longer, they are waiting to

take me to the shore. You have been a good friend to us all; without

your assistance I might never have been here to bid you good-bye. May

the great good Spirit bless and help you on the big, broad waters and in

the lonely woods. You, Paul, ask him to guide you. I shall always ask

the Great Spirit to look after you, and, if it be the Great Chief's

will, I may come back to see you again." A smile played over his face as

she uttered the last words, and he brushed the tears from her pale hand

with his long flowing hair. She asked him for a lock of his hair; he cut

off a piece and handed it to her. She then went to the boat, but the

Indian did not leave the cabin.


Margaret was so completely overcome with emotion that she laid her head

on her husband's shoulder and quietly wept, as they were being rowed to

the shore.


Captain Godfrey knew that his wife admired the Indian for his courage

and honour, but was entirely ignorant of those warmer feelings that Paul

expressed for Mrs. Godfrey during his leave-taking.


The Godfreys remained at Halifax four months after Paul Guidon had

sailed, and Margaret never ceased to praise the actions of the noble red

man. Yet, it may be after all, that the husband and children owed their

lives, as much to the good sense, brave spirit, firmness and steadiness

in the face of danger, of the wife and mother, as to the action of the

noble Iroquois. Yet again had not Paul appeared on the scene at 3Fort

Frederick and at the taking of the boat, all the splendid traits of

character possessed by Margaret might have availed little in defeating

the purposes of the other Indians.


Noble bearing and grand courage in the case of Mrs. Godfrey, it would

appear, touched the tenderest chords of the Iroquois' heart, and brought

to the surface his better nature. Naturally, some human beings are

better than others. Such seem born to exert a power and cast a healthy

influence all about them. Doubtless Margaret was one of this class. Her

early training, her immortal hope, her strong belief in the spread of

everlasting truth, and in prayer and God, had much to do in steadying

and solidifying her character.


We may all profit by her example, if we seek to incorporate the

principles of the Christian religion into our every day actions and

life, in the full conviction that it is the happiest life, the soundest

life, the bravest life, that partakes of the mild and peaceful spirit of

Christianity. Something more than ordinary courage in the presence of

yelling savages and flights of arrows is necessary to support a delicate

woman single handed and alone; this something Margaret Godfrey

possessed, and, possibly, the penetrating eye of the Iroquois detected

it in her every feature and movement.


The King's schooner arrived at Passmaquaddy in due time, and Paul took

his departure for his native woods. He sent word hack by the captain of

the schooner to Margaret Godfrey that he would watch for her spirit some

evening when he sat by his mother's grave. He felt sure he would see

her there.


In the next chapter Captain Godfrey and family will be followed across

the ocean, and Paul Guidon will be allowed to remain in his native

woods, to fish, to shoot, and occasionally to sit beside Old Mag's grave

and commune with her immortal spirit.


    CHAPTER VI.


    IN ENGLAND.—THE CAPTAIN AND THE LORDS.


The "Adamante" arrived in England after a rough and stormy passage of

forty-eight days. Captain Godfrey and family suffered severe hardships

on the run over the Western Ocean. Owing to his exhausted funds, Captain

G. was unable to provide his family the conveniences and comforts which

would have rendered the voyage home more agreeable than under the

circumstances it proved itself to be. As it was they suffered severely.

They had no bedding, and found their beaver skins a great luxury to

sleep on. The few pounds that the sale of the sloop brought him were all

expended during his long stay at Halifax while he was waiting for an

opportunity to sail for England.


Margaret Godfrey was as high spirited as she was brave, and would not

condescend to seek assistance from their friends in Halifax. If

assistance was not gratuitously bestowed, she was the last woman in the

world to beg. The family were well cared for while in the capital of the

province (or to put it in Mrs. Godfrey's words) "as well as people

generally are who have honestly lost their all. Our real wants were not

known to the middle and lower classes, and that other class was not

heartily concerned about our future. Governor Campbell, all honor to his

name, secured and paid our passages."


The cabin of the "Adamante" was below deck, it was dark, dingy and

dirty. The bows of the vessel resembled the side of a tub, and the stern

the end of a puncheon cut through the centre lengthways. A passage

across the stormy ocean in the "Adamante" in the winter of 1771-2, in

comparison to one in an ocean greyhound of 1889, would be much the same

as the difference between a ride in an ox-cart and one in a palace car,

both for comfort and speed.


A terrific storm was experienced off the west coast of Ireland, in which

the foretopgallant mast and jibboom were carried away. The water-casks

and caboose were washed overboard, and the cook carried into the forward

shrouds feet foremost, where he hung like a fish in a net. With this

exception, no accident occurred during the passage.


Shortly after Captain Godfrey arrived in London, he called on the Earl

of Hillsborough and made known to that gentleman his great misfortune,

and also delivered to His Lordship the letter of recommendation which

Lord William Campbell had been pleased to give him. After the Earl of

Hillsborough had carefully perused the letter and examined into Captain

Godfrey's affairs, His Lordship was most generously pleased to present

him with twenty guineas out of his private purse for present relief,

until His Lordship could more essentially serve him.


Not long afterward Captain Godfrey's case was laid before the Right

Honourable the Lords of Trade. The Earl of Hillsborough was again

pleased to grant him fifty guineas from his private purse for a

temporary support, with the assurance of providing for his further

support till his case was settled.


Upon Lord Hillsborough's resignation as first Lord of Trade and

Plantations, his Lordship was pleased to recommend Captain Godfrey's

case to the Earl of Dartmouth, who succeeded His Lordship in office.


The case, with all the original papers and certificates, was laid before

the Earl of Dartmouth and the Right Honorable the Lords of Trade and

Plantations. A commission was appointed by Parliament and several Lords

sat on it, but nothing definite was arranged. Captain Godfrey remained

for the greater part of the time in England and sometimes in Ireland,

all the time seeking relief from Lords many until the year 1773. All

this time he was in great difficulty and distress through his losses in

the Colony. Fortunately for himself and his family, he was left a legacy

in 1773 amounting to a considerable sum, which enabled him a second time

to try his luck in Nova Scotia. He expended a large sum of money in

purchasing goods suitable for the colonial trade, and embarked with the

goods and his wife and family in 1774, and once again settled on his

estate at Grimross.


His former misfortune did not discourage him; he was full of hope for

the future. He left his case in the hands of his fellow-countrymen. What

a pity he did not induce some of these English Lords to accompany him

and spend a winter with him in the wilds of Nova Scotia. It is quite

possible had he been able to prevail upon them to do so, that they would

have returned home in the early spring and strongly advised the Lords of

Trade and Plantations to at once settle the case of Captain Godfrey by

reimbursing him for his losses.


The boast of England is her colonies, yet the statesmen of Britain at

that time knew little, and, in all probability, cared less, about the

hardships, dangers and perils which their countrymen were enduring while

laying the foundations of a Greater Britain.


The great bulk of the early colonists were thoroughly British, and

Captain Godfrey was no exception. They suffered what most early

colonists suffer, but they suffered without murmuring, because they were

Englishmen in an English colony. They possessed a sort of blind loyalty

and a sincere patriotism toward their King and old England. Their spirit

is ours, and a century or more has been forming and moulding it into a

purely Canadian patriotism, while the wisdom displayed for fifty years

by the best ruler that ever sat upon the British throne, has

strengthened the attachment British North Americans have had for English

institutions and induced them to cling strongly to them, though the

circumstances of a new country have required a modification in the forms

of those institutions.


Queen Victoria's good sense, excellent judgment, and consequently wise

rule, have made the people of every portion of the Colonial Empire feel

that they have an interest in the Mother land.


Long may she reign; and God grant that the American Republic may never

be allowed to extend its institutions to our Dominion, and overthrow the

foundations laid by our ancestry and on which we are building.


    CHAPTER VII.


    ARRIVAL AND RETREAT.


In the month of September, 1774, Captain Godfrey, after an absence of

three years, arrived and settled for the second time on the estate at

Grimross Neck. He lost no time in preparing to once again try his luck

in trading with the Indians and settlers. He erected and finished a

house and store, and before winter set in everything was made ready to

receive his wife and family, who arrived in the latter part of November.


He commenced trading again buoyant with the hope of retrieving his

losses, and for a short time he carried on a profitable business. The

Indians were comparatively quiet, and he and his family enjoyed a season

of peace. Uprightness stamped all the Captain's dealings. He remarked to

a friend, that he had again attempted to do business in the colony, and

said he: "with the spirit of a true British soldier, I mean to do or die

in the attempt, and my dealings with both the white and red man shall be

guided by the dictates of an honest conscience. I hope I shall succeed."

He felt almost certain that the dark plots and devilish crimes of the

Indians would never have occurred had Paul Guidon been near him. He

would often say to his wife: "I wonder where Paul has gone?" Since his

arrival at Grimross he often made enquiries as to Paul's whereabouts,

but none of the tribe on the St. John appeared to know where he was. Six

months had elapsed since his arrival and yet he had received no tidings

of the brave Iroquois.


Mrs. Godfrey, true to the promise she had made to Paul on board the

King's schooner in Halifax harbour, never revealed to her husband the

Indian's feelings of regard toward her. Like a wise woman, she

considered it better to let the matter forever rest.


Captain Godfrey presented Paul with the two muskets previous to the

Indian leaving Halifax for Passmaquaddy. Paul named one "Old Mag" and

the other "Chief Mag," cutting as he did so an arrow mark in the butt of

the latter, and saying "this one my Chief." The Captain told his wife of

the circumstance, and she laughingly remarked that it was a custom among

the Indians to name trinkets and presents after the persons who had

given them. She believed as Paul had seen her first at Fort Frederick,

her name was probably first in his thoughts when accepting the muskets.


One night, in the month of March, 1775, Captain Godfrey and his wife

were aroused from their slumbers by a loud and continued knocking at the

house door. The night was very dark. The Captain got up, dressed

himself, and called his eldest son, (Charlie) a lad of sixteen. They

together went to the door, asked who was there, and what was wanted. The

answer came ringing back, Paul Guidon. The Captain called his wife, as

he did not recognize the voice as that of Paul. She came and said, "Is

that you, Paul?" "Me, real Paul, and got Chief Mag with me," was the

answer. Margaret could not recognize the voice as that of Paul. She said

to her husband, "it sounds more like the voice of a British officer than

that of an Indian." She lit a candle, and said, "Paul, do you know me?"

"Yes, yes," he replied; "arrow mark on arm, and almost dead with you

under windlass in sloop, great storm, lost canoe." She opened the door,

and in stepped Paul Guidon, dressed in the military uniform presented to

him at Halifax, or a similar one, and in his hand a musket. A fire was

made, and Paul was so pleased to once again see his old friends that he

could not sit quiet. He walked up and down the kitchen with a quick

nervous tread, looking like a hero from some field of victory. Margaret

burst out in exclamation, "So it is really you, Paul; you who

accompanied us in our trials, and watched over us in our dangers, and

who, side by side with me, lay on the verge of eternity, while the

roaring of the ocean and the howling of the storm passed along unheeded

by us both." There before them was the brave Chief, (the "Young Lion of

the Woods,") who a few years before, at Fort Frederick, was subdued by

the presence of Margaret Godfrey, where her exhibition of unexampled

fortitude took a deep hold of the very being of the Iroquois and turned

him from an enemy to a friend.


The Indian remained with the Godfreys for a few days, amusing himself

with shooting and assisting in a general the premises. Trouble occurring

among the tribe of which Paul was a sub-chief, he was sent for to

return to the tribe, and at a great war council he was elected Chief in

Thomas' place.


About this time the colonists in New England were beginning to show

signs of dissatisfaction with the Mother land, and some Americans living

along the St. John river were showing signs of discontent, and becoming

agitated over matters in New England. The American sympathisers did all

they could to stir the Indians along the river to revolt.


Paul Guidon did all in his power to soothe their savage breasts, and

soon after returned to Grimross Neck. In a short time the rebellion

broke out, and affairs in New England were fast assuming a most serious

aspect. The rebels in the vicinity of Grimross were fully aware of

Captain Godfrey's firm attachment to the cause of King George the Third.

At length they approached him and tried hard to persuade him to enter

the service of the dissatisfied colonists. The cross-eyed, monkey-faced

character alluded to in a former chapter, was their chief spokesman on

this occasion, and instead of stuttering, as on a former visit, his

words flowed forth as freely and as fast as the waters of a mill-race.

It may be that similar specimens of humanity exist in every age, whose

folly and wickedness seem to be perpetual. Will such characters ever

learn to live and be content under the old flag of their fathers, or

will they be content to live on despised by their countrymen? Should

such seditious spirits ever receive mention from the historian, it must

be anything but a flattering one, and must cause the blush to mantle

upon the cheek of any worthy descendant.


Captain Godfrey was offered by the rebels the command of a party of men

to march forward and attack Fort Cumberland, besides which further

inducements of preferment and advancement were held out to him. But

nothing the rebels could offer was able to shake his allegiance to King

George the Third. His former losses, his present situation, the safety

of his wife and family, his treatment by the Board of Trade and

Plantations, were all to him of less importance than his duty to his

sovereign. Unshaken and unmoved he replied to the traitors, "I am as

zealous as ever I was in my life for the cause of my King and my

country."


The rebels finding the Captain firm in his determination not to forsake

his King, approached Margaret Godfrey. She was protected not only by her

good sense and thorough good judgment, her sterling honour and decided

character, but also by the highest convictions of duty. In answer to

them she replied, "My husband has given you his answer and in it he has

also given you mine. You will oblige by at once leaving the premises."

They made a hasty exit from her presence, and did not return for some

weeks.


A day or two after the rebels had left Grimross, Paul Guidon related to

Mrs. Godfrey his life and wanderings after his arrival at Passmaquaddy

from Halifax in 1771. "He found his way from Passmaquaddy to Grimross

Neck, carrying the two muskets with him, and also a knapsack filled with

powder, shot and bullets, given to him by the Captain of the King's

schooner."


"He then went to where the tribe was living and remained some weeks,

being very tired and weary. Pére Thoma, taking a great fancy to his red

jacket, offered to canoe him down the river to his old camping ground if

he would give him the coveted garment on their return. Paul consented to

do so. One fine morning they started from Grimross Neck and paddled all

day down the river, occasionally resting on the banks of the stream. It

came into his (Paul's) head, on the way down that Pére Thoma was the

cause of the Godfreys' misfortunes, and he suddenly felt that the spirit

of "Old Mag" (his mother) called upon him to kill Thoma. The burning of

the house, the escape of his mother from the flames, the driving away of

the English people, the great storm on the bay, his first sight of the

pale-faced woman at Fort Frederick, the parting with her at Halifax, all

these events recurred to his mind in an instant and went like a flash

through his brain. His head seemed to dance like the canoe on the water,

then the canoe appeared to whirl round and round. He got so dizzy he

could scarcely see, and was afraid that he would fall overboard. He felt

something touch him on the shoulder like a dip from the wing of a bird.

He had his musket in the canoe, it was loaded. He suddenly pulled in the

paddle and then grasped the musket. It was "Chief Mag," and he pointed

it at Thoma who was sitting in the stern of the canoe. He fired and

Thoma rolled overboard and sank. Paddling on he arrived at his old

camping ground near the mouth of the river. The wigwam was still

standing but very much out of order, he sat in it till daylight and then

visited his mother's grave. After returning to the camp as he felt sad

and faint, he took his musket and wandered off in search of game. He

spent the remainder of the day near the resting place of "Old Mag," at

night he went to the camp and there slept. In the morning he got into

the canoe and paddled off up the river, arriving at Grimross he went on

shore and started at once by trail for Quebec, where after two moons he

arrived carrying Chief Mag with him. Here he was much in request by the

military, who detained him for three winters accompanying them on their

hunting excursions. During the latter part of the last winter, while

shooting with some officers on the borders of Acadia and Quebec, he met

an old Indian by the name of Joe Paul moving West with his family. From

him he learned that the pale-faced people were again living and trading

at Grimross. Paul told the officers that he must go back to the St.

John. They were not inclined to release him, until he had accompanied

them back to Quebec. Yielding to their entreaties he returned with them,

remaining a few days. Just before he left Quebec, there was a great stir

among the military. It was rumoured that war was impending, and the

officers tried hard to persuade him to remain and share with them the

fortunes of war, if they should be ordered to take part in the fighting.

He said he could not stay, but promised the officers, as he put on a new

red jacket they had given him, that he would never fight against the

British soldiers. As Paul came to this part of his narration he looked

straight at Margaret Godfrey and continued, (it is given in his own

words) "all Paul want to make him British soldier be pale face and

little hair."


In a few days the Iroquois went out again to visit his tribe. Desiring

to revisit his mother's grave he required some one to assist him down

the river. He selected as his companion Francis DeFalt who appeared

willing to accompany him. On the way down he found out from DeFalt, that

he was one of the Indians who by Thoma's commands set fire to the

Englishman's house and store. DeFalt bragged about what he had done and

said his only sorrow was, that all the white devils were not burned up

with the house.


As DeFalt was speaking, the Iroquois blood began to stir quickly. As

soon as darkness was closing down over the face of the river Paul

meditated on revenge. He seized Chief Mag, which he always took with

him, and fired it at DeFalt, who turning a complete somerset over the

bow of the canoe into the river, was seen no more. Paul drifted down

stream a few miles, paddled to the shore, hauled the canoe upon dry

land, turned it over and slept under it during the night, feeling

satisfied that he had avenged the insult to the pale-faces. Paul

remained about the old camping ground for three weeks, when he again

returned to Grimross. The Iroquois was never suspected as the cause of

Thoma's disappearance, the canoe was afterwards found, bottom up, in the

river, and he was supposed to have been drowned.


On Paul's return to his tribe, he told the Indians that DeFalt had

become acquainted with a pretty young squaw named Charlotte Toney, and

had gone over to Fort Cumberland to spend a few months with the Toney

family, who were moving over there to settle during the coming winter,

and that DeFalt would likely be married before his return. The Iroquois

shortly after this returned to Grimross to spend a few days with his

pale-faced friends. He told Margaret that some of the tribe were greatly

agitated. The American sympathisers had seduced them by making great

promises and by holding up to them a grand future. Paul said to Captain

Godfrey, "you may all be murdered if you stay at Grimross; some bad

white men now among Indians." Margaret did not care to advise her

husband to leave, although she had learnt enough from Paul to convince

her that great danger was all about them.


The Iroquois had proposed to Margaret to escape with her children to

Fort Frederick, saying that he would take them down the river in

DeFalt's canoe, which he had kept at Grimross. He said to her, "I will

never leave you in times of trouble and will lose my life to save

yours." She would not consent to leave her husband, although he strongly

advised her to go, if she thought their lives in danger.


At length the Rebels and Red men grew furious. They arrived at Grimross

early one morning, while Paul was out among the tribe trying to keep

them quiet, and surrounding the house and store of Captain Godfrey they

demanded his surrender. The yells and whoops of the Indians were

terrific, demons from the depths of perdition could not have made a more

frightful noise. The children were terrified; the youngest fainted with

fright. At this crisis Margaret Godfrey calmly walked to the door while

her husband and son Charlie stood a few paces in her rear. She opened

the door, and as she did so in rushed the demons, led by the cross-eyed,

monkey-faced rebel. One of the Indians by name Pete Gomez, took hold of

Margaret and forced her to the floor, Charlie took up a stick of wood

and knocked Gomez senseless. At this moment Paul Guidon returned,

Horatio Keys, one of the rebels, had seized Captain Godfrey by the

throat and was holding him tightly against the wall, Margaret clinched

the rolling-pin and in an instant sent Keys staggering to the floor. The

squinting monkey-faced rebel's name was Will, and Will by force pushed

Margaret to the floor, and was dragging her by the hand toward the door,

as Paul stepped in. Paul struck him with his fist, and like lightning

placed both his feet against the rebel's breast, almost knocking the

life out of him. Jim Wade, Sam Scarp, and Mark Paul, three Indians,

rushed in after Paul, who turned and struck Wade a terrific blow on the

neck, knocking him out. The Captain, Charlie, Paul and Margaret went for

the other two in lively style and soon laid them low. The remaining

rebels and Indians beat a hasty retreat to the woods. The insolent

invaders who had got so deservedly well punished at the hands of the

Godfrey household were pitched out of the house, and when they had

sufficiently recovered they also made for the woods. During the tumult

the four smaller children were fastened in the bedroom and their screams

were terrible. The night after the assault was a dismal and anxious one

at Grimross. The children trembled and sobbed during the entire hours of

darkness. The morning at length dawned, and with its dawning Margaret

Godfrey's soul went out for counsel and guidance to Him, who in all

their perils, in the darkest moments of their lives, had never forsaken

them.


She said to Paul Guidon, "the rebels may kill my husband, my children

and myself, but from this hour their threats shall not intimidate me

from acting as a British subject should act in a British Colony. I shall

do my duty, for under God I am determined whenever and however we

attempt to make our escape, if I have to die I shall die free and not as

a slave or traitor." The Indian who had attentively listened to

Margaret's words promised to stand by her.


"Paul Guidon," she continued, "there remains to us a great duty to be

performed. I am fully convinced there will be a way of escape opened to

us, but we must seek it first. Cannot we escape to Fort Frederick? Is

the canoe safe to convey the whole of us and what stuff we may require?"

To which the Iroquois replied, "If water smooth no trouble, trouble may

be Indians 'long river bank, I go up Neck and bring down canoe." This

latter he quickly did, hauling it on shore and hiding it among some

bushes.


In a few days three of the rebels, armed with pistols, again came to the

shop of Captain Godfrey, and sternly demanded of him all his goods and

chattels, to be held by them in trust, and to be restored to him at the

close of the American rebellion, on condition that he joined General

Washington. His refusal of these conditions was, by the decree of the

war committee, to be punished with death. This committee had a number of

armed men as the instruments by which they enforced their decrees. The

three envoys gave the Captain one hour to consider their proposal.


At the expiration of the hour Margaret Godfrey and her husband came into

the room where the rebels were seated. Margaret asked them how her

husband and family should be able to join General Washington; "Would

they not be arrested as spies or enemies of the New England colonists if

they attempted to pass over among them?"


One of the rebels answered her, "If you will go and join General

Washington, we will give you a pass into New England, and as soon as we

can consult with the war committee we will bring or send you the

passport."


Margaret trembled lest her husband would suddenly object to the

proceeding, as nothing definite had been arranged during their hour of

debating the situation, only that they must escape if possible. She was

well aware of her husband's sterling loyalty. She caught his eye and

nodded to him to assent to the proposition of the rebels.


He did so. The rebels left, promising the pass the next day, and that in

twenty-four hours after receiving it, a guard would be ready to escort

them on their way to New England. It being late in the afternoon the

rebels then left. At noon the following day a messenger arrived with the

passport, and also an order to be ready to proceed toward New England on

the following day. The permit or passport read as follows:


Permit the bearer, Charles * * * Godfrey, * * * Esqr.,

to pass from river St John in Nova Scotia with his family

to any part of New England.


Maugerville, ye 8 July, 1776. } By order of the Committee, JACOB BARKERLY, _Chairman_.


After a few words of conversation with the Captain and his wife, the

messenger took his departure. No time was lost in preparing to escape.

Mrs. Godfrey was determined to have everything in the canoe before

daylight next morning. The night fortunately was fine, and if all went

well they would be well on their way to Fort Frederick before Jacob

Barkerly or any of the rebels were aware of their departure. Accordingly

the night was a busy one getting ready and transferring bundles of stuff

to the canoe, which was some distance off. At early dawn all were in

readiness, and the last to leave the homestead at Grimross were Margaret

and Paul, who had returned from the shore for a box containing the

Captain's private papers, which had been overlooked in the hurry. A few

minutes before four o'clock the Indian and Mrs. Godfrey arrived at the

canoe with the box.4


The morning was a lovely one, and Margaret Godfrey was the most hopeful

and cheerful of the little band of fugitives who were preparing to step

into the canoe. Her every act and word seemed void of fear. Defeat and

disaster with her were but spurs to further effort. She possessed that

fortitude of soul that bears the severest trials without complaint. A

few minutes after four o'clock they pushed off from the shore, the water

was quite calm, but the progress was slow as the canoe was deeply laden,

and Paul Guidon had to be very cautious in its management. Not an Indian

was seen on the shore. The next day they arrived at Paul's old camping

ground, and after resting there a few hours they started for Fort

Frederick, a short distance below. Here fortune seemed to smile upon

them. A small schooner lay at anchor immediately below the fort.

Margaret and her husband lost no time in going on board. The Captain of

the schooner said that his vessel would sail for Port Royal, if there

were sufficient wind, early the next day. He agreed to take the whole

Godfrey family over with them. Paul seemed bound to accompany them, and

it pleased Margaret, when she found out that he was anxious to go with

them, as she feared he would be murdered if caught by the rebels. Toward

evening they all embarked on board the schooner, Paul having got

permission from the Captain of the vessel to take his canoe on board,

he, assisted by Charlie, embarked it also.


In the morning there being a fair wind sail was set, and next day all on

board were safely landed at Annapolis. Fortune once more favoured the

Godfrey family, at Annapolis Royal there they found a British sloop of

war. Margaret got Paul to take her and her husband in his canoe to the

ship. They were received on board by the Captain in the most cordial

manner, who said they had arrived in good time, as he intended to sail

in a day or two. In a short time Captain Godfrey and his wife returned

to the shore, having completed arrangements with the Captain of the ship

for a passage to Halifax.


In a day or two the Godfrey family, accompanied by the Indian, sailed in

the British sloop-of-war Viper, commanded by Captain Greaves.


Four days later the Viper arrived in Halifax harbour, and previous to

the Godfreys disembarking, Mrs. Godfrey requested permission of Captain

Greaves to address a few words of farewell to the ship's company. Her

request being granted and all hands ordered on deck, Mrs. G., in

appropriate terms and in a modest, yet dignified manner, spoke words of

counsel to the company, concluding her short exhortation in these words:

"And to the Captain of my salvation I commend you all."


    CHAPTER VIII.


    REBEL PLANS—PRAYING THE LORDS.


Before Captain Godfrey sailed with his family from Halifax for England,

he waited on Governor Arbuthnot and General Massie5 and informed them

of the rebels intentions, and gave them a history of his sad experience

on the St. John.


He told them that he had been offered by the rebels the command of a

party of men to march forward and attack Fort Cumberland, and if they

(the rebels) should be successful, they were to be reinforced, and at

once proceed to Halifax, set fire to the town, and sack it.


In their proceedings the rebels, who were in constant communication with

the New Englanders, and who were instructed by them, were talking of

forming this plan in order if possible to keep General Howe's army from

being largely reinforced.


Captain Godfrey, though very weak and ill, offered his service to

General Massie, if the latter would arm two schooners and put on board

of each of them one hundred regulars besides a crew of twenty-five men.

He proposed to proceed to Fort Cumberland and secure the place in case

an attack was made. His offer was declined. He then bid adieu to Halifax

and sailed for England, where he and his family arrived on January the

8th, 1777.


He lost no time in applying to Lords North and Germain, who after proper

examination found his claims for losses in the colony well founded; and

were generously pleased to order him the annual sum of one hundred and

fifty pounds for the temporary support of his family. This sum was

afterward reduced to one hundred and twenty pounds, and finally

altogether withdrawn.


He then put his distressed condition before the government, and his case

was again tossed about from Lord to Lord, and from board to board, and

finally brought up again before the Lords of Parliament, and from it was

sent back to the Lords of Plantations and Trade. From thence to the

Lords of commission for services and losses in America, and the Lord

only knows where else it was sent, until it was sent out to Nova Scotia

in 1784.


Thirteen years had elapsed since the Captain experienced his first

misfortune in Nova Scotia, and more than seven years had elapsed since

his second loss, then his case was sent out to Nova Scotia.


During all this long time he had exercised the greatest patience, and

his loyalty to his King (George the Third) was never for a moment

shaken.


He had lost in lands and goods about twelve thousand pounds sterling by

settling in a British Colony where Indians and rebels destroyed his

prospects, and yet he had received no redress for the hardships he and

his family had endured, and the great wrongs inflicted upon them. His

wife and children were allowed to remain in an almost destitute

condition by the King and his advisers. Financially, Captain Godfrey

could have been in no worse condition had he joined General Washington.

But there was no power on earth that could induce the Captain to turn

his back upon his King and his country.


He, with the assistance of his heroic wife, had done all in their power

to rouse the whole mind and heart of their fellow countrymen in office

to a satisfactory settlement of their just claims, but all they had done

seemed useless, and they knew not what more to do.


After the close of the American war Captain Godfrey once more thought of

crossing the ocean to settle in the colony where he had experienced so

much misfortune. But after he had made all the arrangements for leaving

England, he found out that he was too weak in body to stand the wear and

tear of a passage across the Atlantic Ocean. In those days it usually

took two months to cross from Great Britain to Nova Scotia.


The Captain's case had been tossed from one official to another, and

from one commission to another, until it had probably travelled through

the completely developed rounds of Red Tapeism. After this it appears

to have been allowed to slumber till the close of the American

Revolutionary War.


Captain Godfrey's health, since his last arrival in England from the

colony, was anything but good, and his means of support being gone, he

was largely depending on friends and relatives for the means of

supporting his family. His eldest son, (Charlie) through the never

failing energy of his mother, had received an Ensign's commission in the

British Army.6


The last effort Captain Godfrey appears to have made in trying to secure

something in return for his services to his country, and for the great

losses sustained by him in the colony, was after the conclusion of the

war between England and America.


He got his case before the "Lords of the Commission" for services and

losses in America, and there it seems to have met its doom, it was

granted a sort of Ticket of Leave for transportation to Nova Scotia,

where it died in exile.


Their Lordships referred Captain Godfrey in the following manner to the

Governor of Nova Scotia:—


  WHITEHALL, May 24th, 1784.


  SIR,—


  You will receive herewith a memorial, which has been presented to me by

  Captain Charles * * * Godfrey, * * * praying that proper orders may be

  given for the immediate recovery of his lands upon the St. John, River,

  in the Province of Nova Scotia. As I understand, upon inquiry, that Mr.

  Godfrey was dis-possessed of his property previous to the Independence

  of America, on account of his loyalty and the active part he took for

  the support of His Majesty King George the Third's Government. I am

  induced to recommend the prayer of the petition to your favourable

  consideration.


  I am, Sir, your most

    Obedient Humble Servant,

      SYDNEY.


  TO JOHN PARR,
Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief

      of the Province of Nova Scotia.


In the year 1776 the New England Colonists appear to have had their

emissaries in Nova Scotia. There is no missing link, the chain of

evidence is completed by the passport to Captain Godfrey from the Rebel

Committee at Maugerville, in July, 1776. After the lapse of one hundred

and twelve years, the fact is revealed that there were persons in Nova

Scotia who were employed by the New England colonists, and paid by them

to incite the Indians to revolt, and hold out bribes to honest and loyal

settlers to forsake their King and country.


It may be that in the near or distant future facts will be brought to

light which will prove beyond a doubt that the United States had

emissaries in Nova Scotia in 1888 who were paid for their services in

Yankee gold.


    CHAPTER IX.


    PAUL GUIDON.


It will be remembered that the Godfreys, accompanied by their faithful

friend Paul Guidon, arrived at Halifax in the "Viper." Paul remained

twelve days with his friend, and then a vessel being about to sail for

Quebec, Commander Greaves secured him a passage in her.


But the farewell almost broke the heart of the noble Iroquois, and he

wept many bitter tears. Margaret Godfrey was aware of Paul's desire to

gain possession of the old service book, she knew he had longed for it

since the day of his mother's burial, and on bidding him adieu she

presented him with the book, saying as she did so, "Paul keep this book,

it is from your friend, no doubt you will sometimes be able to get some

one to read to you useful lessons from its pages."


Paul Guidon had frequently told Mrs. Godfrey that he felt a sort of

charm come over him whenever his eyes rested on the book, and when he

touched it with his hand he imagined he could hear his mother whisper

the words, "Paul be good man, and bye and by you will come to me on the

sunny plains of the happy hunting ground."


At Quebec a British officer, becoming greatly attached to Paul, engaged

him as a sort of confidential servant, and noticing the Iroquois

admiration for the military dress, he had a suit made for him. Indeed,

Paul became an especial favorite with all the soldiers of the garrison.

Colonel MacLean, with whom the Indian had engaged, had great confidence

in him, and frequently trusted him to carry important messages. The

Colonel found him to be a most trusty fellow, and occasionally sent him

alone to observe the enemy's movements. Paul was as straight as an

athlete and had an eye keen as an eagle's. He scarcely ever failed in

reporting to the Colonel something worth knowing.


On the night of December 31st, 1776, the Iroquois advanced in a creeping

position so close to the enemy's lines, that on his return he was able

to state to the Colonel what the enemy were doing, and he told what he

had observed in such an intelligent way that the British were prepared

to meet and repulse every attack of Arnold and Montgomery on that night.

In the attack Montgomery was killed and Arnold wounded.


One night, an exceptionally dark and stormy one, the Indian was sent out

to reconnoitre. He lost his way, and getting inside the enemy's lines,

came near being captured. In the dense darkness he crept right up

against one of the enemy's pickets. The sentry fired, and Paul fell flat

on the snow quite near the sentry's feet, the shot passing over the

Indian's head. In another instant Paul had regained his feet, and while

the sentry was attempting to reload his musket the Iroquois grasped at

him, and in doing so caught him by his hands, which were clasped

tightly around the weapon. The sentry gave a most determined backward

jerk, but Paul held him firmly and then wrenched the musket out of his

hands, bringing with it a ring off the sentry's finger. The Iroquois put

the ring on his own finger and made off at once for the British lines.

In his haste, when nearing the British outposts, he stumbled and fell,

and with such force that he was knocked senseless and lost the ring. He

lay there for some time, and when he had somewhat recovered he found

himself so benumbed with the cold that he could scarcely move his limbs.


It was snowing when he fell, and when he became conscious of his

situation, he found himself covered with an inch or more of snow, and

his head and face badly cut and bruised. On all four he crept to the

British outposts with the blood streaming from a cut in his leg and one

on his face. At last he reached the lines, more dead than alive. Paul

received a cold from which he never recovered.


In the morning he crawled out in search of the ring, thinking it might

be of some value. He was enabled to find the place where he had fallen

by retracing his steps and seeing the blood on the snow in spots here

and there. It had stopped snowing soon after he recovered consciousness,

consequently it was not difficult next morning to find out the spot

where he had received his injuries. The sun was shining brightly, and as

he kicked away the snow after hunting about for an hour or so, his eye

caught something shining brilliantly. He picked it up. It was a ring. He

put it into his pocket and returned. He knew he had seen the ring

before. He put it in an inside pocket of his coat and sewed it in,

fearing he might otherwise loose it.


The Indian for a long time was unfitted for active duty. He made his

home sometimes at the garrison and sometimes with the tribes of Indians

in the neighborhood.


When General Burgoyne, in June, 1777, advanced from Canada into the New

England States, Paul Guidon attached himself to one of the officers of

the expedition. This officer was afterward killed and Paul was captured

by the Americans and sent a prisoner to Boston, and at that place

detained for some months.


At length he managed to make his escape. He wandered for weeks in the

woods and along the paths, and at last struck the Nova Scotia boundary

and continued on until he reached the vicinity of Fort Frederick. There

he remained for a short time visiting the scenes and places of other

days. He then set out once more for Quebec, and arrived there in

September, 1778, where he remained till the close of the war. In

September, 1780, he was united in marriage with a handsome young

Chipewayan squaw. Paul Guidon was loved and admired by most of the

Indians of the Quebec district, and never wanted for a home amongst

them.


His wife was of medium height, her face was handsome, and her features

clean-cut, as they are seen in Greek statuary. She was as brown as some

statues are. Her eyes were of the deepest and brightest black, they were

quick and piercing as arrows sent to their mark.


    CHAPTER X.


MARGARET GODFREY ARRIVES IN NOVA SCOTIA.—DEATH OF THE YOUNG LION OF THE

WOODS.


In the month of August, 1784, Margaret Godfrey once again arrived in

Nova Scotia. This time she came alone, her husband being too ill to

accompany her. She left her English home and came out to Nova Scotia to

secure a personal interview with Governor Parr, and do all in her power

to get back the property on the St. John River; or if not, then she

would endeavor to secure some compensation for it, through the

instrumentality of the governor. She remained at Halifax a few weeks,

and then left for the St. John River. She did not appear satisfied with

her visit to the governor. She could get no promise from him that the

estate at Grimross Neck would be restored to her husband, or that any

compensation would be granted in its stead. Nothing seems to have been

done in her interest, and she left Halifax deeply disappointed in her

mission.


Trouble had recently arisen between the people settled at the mouth of

the St. John and the authorities at Halifax. Instead of one Province she

was informed that there were now two Provinces. She determined to cross

over to Parrtown, and see what she could accomplish by visiting the

estate personally. With the letter from Sydney to Governor Parr, she

took a certificate of survey, which read as follows:


  This may certify, that by the desire of Captain ——, I have laid nine

  hundred acres of land on the Peninsular or place called Grimross Neck,

  in the Township of Gage, on the River St. John, beginning at the Portage

  and running down the river about two miles and a quarter to a maple tree

  marked, thence running S.W. till it meets Grimross Creek, thence up the

  said Creek to the Portage, thence crossing the Portage to the first

  mentioned bounds.


  ISRAEL PERLEY,
Dept. Surveyor.


Gagetown, Jany. 31st, 1771.


Mrs. Godfrey finding that nothing could be accomplished by her visit up

the river, returned to the settlement at its mouth. The place of

settlement had undergone a great change since the year 1770, when she

first came to Fort Frederick with her husband.


She remained at Parrtown a few weeks, in order if possible to gather

further information respecting the property at Grimross Neck, and to

consult with some of the leading inhabitants, as to what course they

would advise her to pursue. She was most kindly entertained by the

people of the place.


One fine morning, while walking about the settlement, she accidently met

a fine looking young Indian girl. The young squaw, whose black eyes

shone in the bright sunshine as polished jet, put out her small brown

hand and said in quite good English, "Please mam, won't you give me

something for sick husband?"


Margaret thought the dusky beauty looked rather young to be married, but

she said to her, "And where does your husband live?"


She pointed her hand up the river and replied, "Not far that way."


"Have you been living here long?" asked Margaret.


"Not very long," replied the young squaw.


"What is the matter with your husband?" said Margaret.


The little squaw answered, "My husband be very sick with consumption,

most dead."


"Where did you get that pretty ring on your finger?" said Mrs. Godfrey

to the Indian woman.


Margaret Godfrey had noticed the ring on the squaw's finger, sparkling

in the sunlight, as she pointed her small brown hand up the river in the

direction of her home.


The swarthy beauty, with an innocent smile, as she hung her head on one

side, said, "My husband give it me after we get married." The Indian

lass then began to run her fingers over a string of red and white beads,

that encircled her round plump neck and hung loosely down over a well

proportioned bosom. At the same time she kept scraping the ground with

the toe of her moccasin, and now and again crossing one foot over the

other and resting the tip of her toe for an instant on the earth. Then

she would swing one of her feet about a foot from the ground over the

other. Her dark blue dress being quite short, and the wind blowing

stiffly, she would occasionally display a small prettily formed foot,

and an ankle that looked as though it had been formed in nature's most

perfect mould.


Mrs. Godfrey broke the silence by asking the young woman if she would

like her to go to the wigwam and see her sick husband? The Indian woman

answered, "May be dead now, and long rough walk, no canoe here."


Margaret said to her, "Suppose you come down here to-morrow morning in a

canoe and take me up to your wigwam?" She answered, "Have no canoe, but

might get Jim Newall's, who lives mile more up river, he has canoe and

sometime bring me down here."


Margaret agreed to accompany her to her wigwam early the next morning,

if Newall and she came to the settlement in a canoe.


She said she would go and see Newall, and if he could not come, she

would walk down and let her (Margaret) know how her husband was.


Mrs. Godfrey told the squaw where she would find her at ten o'clock the

next morning, and then taking the hand of the Indian woman into that of

her own, looked carefully at the ring, as she bid her good day.


Margaret recognized the ring as the one she had lost during the assault

of the rebels at Grimross, in 1776. She missed it from off her finger

soon after the cross-eyed, monkey-faced rebel "Will," had pulled her

about the floor by the hand, and never saw or heard of it after. Paul

Guidon often said to Mrs. Godfrey, that he believed the rebel "Will" had

stolen her ring.


It was a very valuable one, set with a choice emerald, surrounded by

precious stones. It was presented to Margaret by her father, on the day

he was elected Mayor of Cork, and cost forty-live guineas. It had never

occurred to Margaret, during her conversation with the squaw, to ask her

name.


Mrs. Godfrey said to herself, "This Indian girl may be a daughter of one

of the savages who attacked us at Grimross. Perhaps she has lied to me

and I may never again see her or the ring. I may possibly get some

information to-morrow that will satisfy me. I must wait."


At ten o'clock the next morning a strapping big Indian knocked at the

door of the house where Mrs. Godfrey was lodging, and inquired if "woman

lived there who wanted go in canoe and see sick Injun up river?"


He was informed that there was a lady inside, ready and waiting for a

man named Jim Newall, to take her up the river. "Me Jim," he replied.


Margaret came to the door. She said, "Are you Jim Newall?" "Yes, me Jim

Newall," he answered gruffly.


Margaret asked Jim how far it was to where he had left his canoe. "Just

few steps," he replied. "Down among stumps at water edge." Margaret

accompanied the Indian, and finding out where the canoe was, told Jim to

remain there until she returned, as she wanted to get a few things for

the sick man.


Half an hour later Mrs. Godfrey and a Mrs. Fowler were making their way

by stumps of trees and over branches, with their arms loaded with things

for the sick Indian. They were soon on board, and then Jim Newall

paddled away up stream.


As the canoe slipped along, every spot on the shores seemed familiar to

Margaret's eyes, and many sad thoughts flashed across her mind; memories

of days never to be forgotten rose in her soul. She remarked to Mrs.

Fowler, "How little everything has changed since I was here last, eight

years ago, except at the settlement."


The morning was a charming one, the river was running, fairly rushing

up, otherwise all nature seemed to sleep. The splash of the paddle, the

ripple of the water along the sides of the canoe, and the gentle rolling

of the little bark, were the only things that disturbed the quiet that

reigned supreme all about. The Indian never spoke, and Margaret and her

companion, as they sat one ahead of the other in the bottom of the

canoe, seldom exchanged a word.


Mrs. Godfrey saw at a glance that the canoe was nearing the place where

Paul Guidon and his mother had once lived. As she looked toward the

shore her eyes rested upon a form standing at the water's edge, and as

the canoe approached nearer and nearer the shore, she recognized the

form as that of the pretty squaw she had met at the settlement the

previous day. Margaret Godfrey remarked to Mrs. Fowler, "There stands

the pretty creature I met yesterday." Mrs. Fowler replied, "She does not

look like the squaws we so often see about the settlement." She

continued, "What a neat, tidy girl she is. I have never seen her at

Parrtown, what a handsome face and fine form she has"


     "And ne'er did Grecian chisel trace 
     A Nymph, a Naiad, or a Grace, 
     Of finer form, or lovelier face." 


The bow of the canoe had now touched the shore, and the Indian lass

most politely made a courtesy to the ladies in the canoe.


After landing, Mrs. Fowler put a piece of silver in Jim Newall's hand

and asked him if he would take them back home again in an hour or two.

Jim nodded an assent as he pulled his little bark out of the water to

the dry land.


Mrs. Godfrey, once on shore, fully recognized that she was at the old

camping ground of her protector in by gone days, Paul Guidon.


The squaw replied to Mrs. Godfrey's inquiry after her sick husband, that

he was very weak, almost dead. Does he know that a white woman is doming

to see him this morning? asked Margaret G. "Yes," replied the Indian

woman, "he be so glad see you, but he be very weak, no speak, he told me

in whisper last night, after I come back camp from Jim Newall wigwam,

best friend, best woman ever saw, was pale face woman, who told him of

Great Chief, Big Spirit, and great hunting ground way back sun, where

old Mag, (mother) was now. Pale face woman gave him book, and would talk

Great Spirit and tell him look after Paul and make him good man."


Is your husband's name Paul? asked Margaret Godfrey. "Yes mam," she

answered, "Paul Guidon his name." Mrs. Godfrey felt all must be a dream.

She appeared lost and bewildered after she had heard the name Paul

Guidon. She cast a glance at her companion and exclaimed, "Am I back to

the old camping ground of Paul Guidon, and is he here?" Then her

faculties seemed to desert her, for at that instant she staggered and

fell into the arms of the Indian woman, with such force as to almost

knock the squaw over. Mrs. Fowler noticing the stupor of her companion

and her pallid features, asked her if she felt ill. She did not reply.


Little Mag, for such was the name of the handsome squaw, ran down to the

river side, filled her moccasins with water and tripping back, she

poured the contents full in the face of Mrs. Godfrey. She went again and

again to the river, filled her moccasins and poured the water over

Margaret's face and temples.


Jim Newall, who was sitting in his canoe a few yards distant, seeing the

woman lying on the ground, came up and proposed to carry her to the

wigwam two hundred yards distant, or under the shade of some trees near

by. The latter proposition was acted upon. Jim, Mrs. Fowler and Little

Mag, carried Margaret to a shaded spot a few yards away. They all sat

down beside her, as she lay stretched and apparently lifeless upon the

ground. After little Mag had once more poured the contents of her shoes

down the neck of Margaret, and Mrs. Fowler had steadily rubbed her

temples and wrists, she opened her eyes, looked wildly about, and then

sat up supported by her companion.


She then commenced to speak in a low weak voice. Mrs. Fowler, listening

attentively, heard her say, "Forever honored be this spot of earth: Here

'Old Mag' departed this life. Here her son Paul, that most noble spirit

of the woods, who when I was weary, distressed, and a wanderer, broken

in everything but spirit, poor in all but faith and courage: Here! Here!

Paul took refuge, and my husband, my children and myself rested. Never

shall that day be forgotten by me. I shall always look back during my

life, and when I get to that other home, I shall, too, look back to this

sacred spot with unabated affection and regard. Here! Here was I eight

years ago with husband and children, unprovided for, unprotected, on the

shore of this river, in a rude and fearful wilderness, surrounded by

savages, but that noble Indian, that splendid Iroquois, whose old mother

lies in everlasting sleep near here, protected us and provided for us.

The hills around are hallowed in my memory, and these trees seem to

stand with grace and beauty. This shore is as sacred to my mind as those

of the Jordan were to the people of old. Here! yes here! how often have

I communed with my loving Saviour! This ground is sacred to me because

it incloses the dust of the mother of my protector. The ashes of old

Margaret Guidon repose here. Is this sacred ground soon to claim the

dust of her loving son? It may be that both came here to live for a

brief space and then to die and mingle their ashes with this Acadian

soil."


Tears streamed down over her beautiful waxen features, as Mrs. Fowler

and little Mag assisted her to her feet. No penitent at a Methodist

revival-service ever looked more serious than did Jim Newall, as

Margaret Godfrey uttered the above.


Margaret had at length sufficiently recovered to proceed to the wigwam,

assisted on either side by little Mag and Mrs. Fowler. The three walked

slowly toward the home of Paul Guidon. Arriving at the entrance of the

wigwam the little Chipewayan led the way inside.


The first object that met the eyes of Mrs. Godfrey was the sick Indian

lying, wasted and emaciated, on a bed of spruce-boughs covered with a

blanket.


Margaret Godfrey at once knelt at his bed-side and placing his dark thin

hand in that of her own, said "Dear Paul, I come to see you."


He looked up at her and stared in a sort of vacant manner. He tried to

raise his head, but was too weak to do so. She looked straight in his

eyes, and said again, "Paul, you remember your old pale-faced friend who

used to live at Grimross Neck?" As Margaret spoke the last word, Paul

Guidon faintly whispered, "Thank Great Chief, I told him get you come

me, Paul must not be made die till you come." Great tears rolled down

his sunken cheeks as he whispered the above, and Margaret Godfrey,

overpowered with emotion, lightly rested her forehead on his thin sinewy

arm. Not a step. Not a sound was heard for a few minutes within the

narrow circle of the wigwam, all rested as if in silent prayer, a more

touching, a more peaceful, a more solemn scene, was never witnessed in

palace or cottage. Deep grief, real sorrow, took full possession of

those women who knelt around the bed of the dying Iroquois, in that

birchen home on the banks of the St John, on the morning of September

the 20th, 1784.


There in the stillness of a North American forest, on a magnificent

autumn day, when the trees were dressed in all their gorgeous

loveliness, and at an hour when not even the rustling of a leaf could be

heard, death was gradually releasing the spirit of Paul Guidon from its

swarthy tenament.


Margaret Godfrey raised her head from off the arm of the Indian, and as

she did so, he again whispered, "me soon be on hunting ground behind

setting sun, you must come see Paul." Mrs. Godfrey, promised him that

she would. He looked at his little wife and tried to move his right hand

toward his breast. She knew what he wanted her to do. She knelt down,

kissed him and took from inside his shirt a book. It was the old service

book. She handed it to Margaret Godfrey, who opened it and read to Paul,

whose eyes were steadfastly fixed on the reader. As she continued

reading, the eyes of the dying Indian gradually closed, and as she, shut

the book he ceased breathing. The spirit of the "Young Lion of the

Woods" had taken its everlasting flight.


             "Like a shadow thrown 
     Softly and sweetly from a passing cloud, 
             Death fell upon him." 


An hour after Paul Guidon had died, Jim Newall, Mrs. Godfrey, Mrs.

Fowler and Mag Guidon went to the shore and brought Newall's canoe to

the wigwam. The dead chief was laid out in a military coat, which he had

kept with great care, on his head was an undress cap, and his lower

limbs were dressed in dark trousers, and long military or hunting boots

coming up to the knee.


Paul Guidon was united in marriage to Margaret Reonadi at Quebec in the

summer of 1760, and several military gentlemen were present at the

ceremony. He was dressed for burial in the same suit in which he was

married.


Newall's canoe, on which the body was laid, was draped along the sides

with evergreens. Spruce boughs were laid athwart the canoe forming a

bed for the body of the departed hero. On his breast were placed his bow

and arrow, also his moccasins. The widowed squaw said the canoe would

help his soul to cross rivers and lakes on the way to the happy hunting

grounds, the arrow would bring down game and the moccasins protect his

feet. When all preparations were completed Newall had arrived back with

another canoe. Mrs. Godfrey and Mrs. Fowler were then taken to the mouth

of the river by Jim, where they secured the services of a man named Cock

to accompany Newall up the river and assist him in digging a grave. A

person by the name of Farris presented Mrs. Godfrey with a British flag,

which he wished displayed at Paul's burial.


The following morning, according to an agreement, Newall came to the

settlement and took Margaret G. and Mrs. Fowler to the wigwam which

should hold the noble Paul no more forever. The British ensign was drawn

over the body of the dead Indian. He lay in a sort of state till next

day, the body being viewed by many of the Indians of the district, and

also by not a few people from the settlement. All those that came

expressed great sorrow for the quiet little Chipewayan widow, who was

far away from her home and people. On the day of the burial there was a

great gathering of the tribes. The body was borne to its final resting

place by ten stalwart Indians, five on each side of the canoe, which was

placed on five paddles. The procession was a most solemn one. The

forest, the rugged scenery, the quiet retreat, all these appeared to add

to the solemnity of the occasion. The grave was alongside that of his

mother, and neatly lined with spruce. At five o'clock in the afternoon

all that was mortal of Paul Guidon was lowered into its last abode.


     "They laid them fondly side by side, 
       And near their icy hearts 
     They placed their arrows and their bows, 
       Their clubs, and spears, and darts; 
     For use when they with life are crowned 
       In heaven's happy hunting ground." 


Margaret Godfrey read the burial service from the old service book,

while rivers of tears flowed down a score of swarthy faces, and an

occasional low wail uttered by the Indians standing round the open

grave, told of their sorrow and superstitious fear. The British ensign

was then placed over the dead Iroquois. It was the flag under which he

had lived and died, and a fit emblem to cover the remains of so true and

brave a man. (The characters of American sympathizers, of traitors and

rebels, as black as they appear in Colonial History, will appear

deeper-dyed as they stand in contrast to the loyalty of this true

Indian.) Margaret Godfrey spoke to them as follows: "I believe it to be

my solemn duty, yea, my special duty on this most sorrowful occasion,

that I should express my feelings. If there ascends from my heart a

prayer to the throne of the Great Chief, in behalf of this youthful

widow and in behalf of you people, let it be a prayer that the Great

Chief may turn the hearts of all from the thoughts of war to sentiments

of mercy and peace, such as our dear brother, whose remains we have just

committed to the grave, possessed in his life. When I think of that

true, and noble man, whose remains lie before us, I thank Him who rules

the winds and guides the stars in their courses, that such a man was

ever born. And if, at some distant period, it may be many years remote,

one of my own or my husband's countrymen (some of whom are now peopling

this country) should visit this spot or this neighbourhood, I trust that

tradition or history may inform such a one that here sleeps one of the

bravest, truest, and most noble sons of the forest that ever lived and

roamed over the hunting grounds of time. He was true to his adopted

country, true to its king, and true to its loyal people. An Indian, but

too honest and noble-minded to be a rebel, he not only discountenanced

the dark plottings of enemies within Acadia, but his sagacity sometimes

was the means of frustrating them. He was an Indian, high in character;

a noble example to some pale faces, to all. His body now rests beside

that little brook, but his spirit is in a country of light and peace.

This country is a good and pleasant country, and those who are coming to

live here are sprung from a noble race, and if you, my friends, all

prove as good and true as this departed red-man, you will have no cause

to complain at the pale faces settling around you. You will secure a

righteous treatment of your race, and your people will be a happy

people. The British people (my people) are a great people, and where

they settle they govern wisely, and in their dealings with all peoples

they are guided by that justice and generosity which alone becomes a

Christian people. These may be the last words I shall ever speak to you.

These may be the last moments I shall ever be with you. Remember my

loving advice and act upon it. If you do this you will earn the love of

the pale faces and build up for your race a lasting renown. You and I,

all of us, can learn good lessons from the life of Paul Guidon. If we

live as he lived we will be happy here, and bye-and-by be more happy in

the hunting fields of the hereafter. If we are as true to our Great

Chief, and as true to our king and country as he was, we will worship

the Great Spirit and never talk against our king and our country. Then

bye and-by we shall go to meet Paul Guidon in a country where there will

be no more wars, no more sighs, no more tears, no more parting, no more

dying."


The Red men paid the utmost attention to the words as they dropped from

Margaret Godfrey's lips. The grave was then filled in and the mourners

dispersed to their homes along the river, leaving Paul Guidon to rest

beside his mother.


For more than a century the "Young Lion of the Woods" has slept on the

banks of the St. John. His loyal spirit took its flight to another

sphere about the time thousands of united loyal spirits were forming a

city near his tomb. The few thousand people that had settled in the

colony in the days of Paul Guidon, were the ancestry of the nearly one

million true, loyal subjects who inhabit the Maritime Provinces at the

beginning of this year 1889. The colony, of which the noble Iroquois was

a citizen, was confined within narrow bounds. Now the sons of the

Loyalists are on the shores of the Pacific. Our country extends there.

It is a noble faculty of our nature which enables us to connect our

thoughts with the past as well as with the future, and by contemplating

the example and studying the character of Paul Guidon, we must come to

the conclusion that were that Indian living now his heart would glow

with patriotic pride at the strides the country has taken, and that our

destiny is Canadian, not American.


It is a pleasure to be able to exhibit to the present generation

something of the splendid character of the Iroquois, whose ashes,

commingled with those of the Union Jack, repose near the loyal City of

St. John.


     "And has he not high honor, 
     The hill side for a pall, 
     He lies in state while angels wait 
     With stars for tapers tall; 
     And the dark rock pines, with tossing plumes, 
     Over his tomb to wave; 
     'Twas a kind dear hand in that lonely land, 
     That laid him in the grave." 


     "In that lonely grave without a name, 
     Where his uncoffined clay 
     Shall break again, O, wondrous thought! 
     Before the Judgment Day, 
     And stand with glory wrapped around 
     On the hills he never trod, 
     And speak of the strife that won our life, 
     And the Incarnate Son of God." 


    CHAPTER XI.


    MARGARET GODFREY'S FAREWELL.


The widowed squaw and the two pale-faced women were the last to leave

Paul's late camping ground. As they were pushed off into the stream by

Jim Newall, who with another Indian paddled them back to the settlement,

Margaret saw the other canoes, nine in number, going up the river. In

the twilight she watched them, and it came to her mind that when Paul

Guidon saw the porpoises at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy coming toward

the sloop, he was not to be blamed for thinking they were canoes. She

remarked to Mrs. Fowler those canoes resemble, at first sight, porpoises

on the Atlantic Ocean.


When they arrived at the settlement Little Mag was taken to the home of

the Lesters. As she sat down in one of the small, unfurnished rooms, she

rested her head upon her hands and bitterly sobbed. Mrs. Godfrey tried

to comfort her, but she wept on. Little Mag said she felt badly at

leaving the wigwam. If she had stayed there her husband's spirit would

have come in the night and been with her. She would not see him but she

would know he was there. Indians always come back the night they are

buried to see their loved ones again before going off to the great

hunting grounds. After a time "Little Mag" fell asleep, and in her

dream, as she reclined on a bench, talked in an unknown tongue. Neither

Margaret nor any present could understand a word she uttered. She

appeared to be conversing with some invisible being, invisible, at

least, to the pale faces. It may have been that in that little room

there was sweet communion between the widowed squaw and her departed

husband. She said to Mrs Godfrey after she awoke that she thought she

saw her husband and heard him say, "Don't worry about Paul." "Happy

hunting grounds here." "See you far off." "Far beyond setting sun." He

appeared to be speaking to her out of the setting sun. He was surrounded

by a golden light, while he looked to be dressed in polished silver, and

when she awoke by falling on the floor, she had started to fling herself

into his arms, which were outstretched to receive her; but when her eyes

were opened all around her was darkness.7


Soon after relating the above she retired to bed and in the morning

seemed refreshed and happy. She sang songs in the Chippewayan tongue

during the morning; her deep black eye became brighter; her step was

light and quick, and her whole frame seemed to move to silent music, so

regular, graceful and quick were her motions.


Who among us of earth knows but there are times in the lives of some of

us, if not all of us, when the silent influences of dear departed

friends, happy in the etherial or spirit world, unconsciously direct our

thoughts and guide our movements.


In a few days Margaret Godfrey was preparing to leave the settlement

and return to Halifax, and there make one more effort to secure some

compensation for her husband's losses on the St. John.


She invited "Little Mag" to give her the history of the ring. In reply,

"Little Mag" said her husband, Paul, had given it to her, and when he

presented it to her told her that it once belonged to the best pale face

woman he had ever seen in all his travels, that it was stolen from off

the pale face's finger, and some moons afterwards he had knocked down

the thief and taken it off his finger, one night far outside the British

lines at Quebec. The thief was a rebel who had nearly killed pale face

woman. About two weeks after Paul had knocked the rebel down, there was

a sharp sortie between some British soldiers and some Americans, and

during the fight, which ended in the repulse of the Americans, the

monkey-faced, cross-eyed rebel, "Will," was taken prisoner. He was a

great coward, and acknowledged to her husband that he had taken the ring

off pale face woman's finger. Her husband told her to keep the ring till

pale face woman saw it. That pale face woman has arrow mark on right arm

above joint. Here Margaret Godfrey pulled up her sleeve and showed the

little squaw the arrow mark received by her at Fort Frederick, in 1770.

"Little Mag's" full brown-face lit up with an innocent smile as she

pulled the precious gem off her own finger and placed it in the hand of

Mrs. Godfrey, at the same time saying, "I know you the pale face who

lost ring." Margaret took the ring put it on her own finger and thanked

"Little Mag" for it.


The Chippewayan widow then took from a pocket in her blue skirt, a

small case and handed it to Margaret Godfrey, who opened it and took

from it a neck-lace of beads mounted with gold. A small gold cross was

attached. "Little Mag" said the neck-lace was given to her by officers

at Quebec when she was married, and Paul had given her the cross at the

same time. She had married Paul when he was visiting among her tribe,

when she was sixteen years old. When they came to Quebec the officers

were very good to them. They gave her plenty of good clothes because

they liked her husband so much.


Paul got sick while hunting with officers last winter. She was with them

and cooking in camp. In early spring left the officers and came down to

St. John River, in May, and built wigwam near his mother's grave. He got

no better, but worse, growing thinner and weaker, with great cough.

"What 'Little Mag' do now my Paul gone?" "I know you good woman will ask

Great Chief to help me go home to my tribe, there live and die. My

little papoose, Paul, dead, sleeps near Quebec, died when few moons

old."


The information in Chapter nine respecting Paul Guidon's career after

leaving Halifax in 1776, was obtained from a document pasted in the back

of the old service book, and written at Paul's request by a Lieutenant

of the British Army stationed at Quebec in the year 1780.


Mrs. Godfrey left Parr Town late in the fall of 1784 for Halifax, and

soon after sailed from the latter place for England. Her mission to

Halifax and the St. John had been a failure. She could get no promise

that her husband's property would be restored to him, or that any

compensation would be granted him in lieu thereof.


As the brigt. in which Margaret Godfrey took passage sailed out of

Chebucto Harbour, she remarked to the captain that people who attempt to

settle in a new colony would do well before leaving comfortable homes in

the old land to find out what protection is guaranteed settlers, and

what class of persons they are likely to settle among. And as she cast a

last look upon the colony, as she entered the companion way to the

cabin, she pointed her hand toward the shore, remarking, "my husband and

I came out to this land in very comfortable circumstances fifteen years

ago; to-day, without a penny to call my own, I leave the colony

forever." The vessel ran across the ocean in thirty-six days, and Mrs.

Godfrey was once again on English soil.


Nothing having been accomplished in Nova Scotia by his wife's visit,

Captain Godfrey once more made an attempt for relief to the Lords of

Parliament at home.


After the close of the American war, a commission was appointed by

Parliament with power to inquire into the losses and services of the

Loyalists in America. Captain Godfrey, as has been stated in a previous

chapter, had put his case before many commissions, before Lords many. To

use a common expression, "his case had gone the rounds." And now, as a

last effort, he was about to present his claims before the Lord

Commissioner of Losses and Services of the American Loyalists. In his

memorial the captain stated to the Lords Commissioners, his services as

a soldier to the time of settling in the colony, concluding with giving

in detail the losses he had sustained on the River St. John, in His

Majesty's Colonial possession, by the cruel and savage acts of Indians

and rebels. He also stated in his memorial that he could have joined the

service of Mr. Washington, and that great inducements were held out to

him to do so, and to desert the cause of his king and his country. The

memorial concluded as follows:


"Your memorialist therefore, humbly prays, that his cause may be taken

into consideration, and that he may be granted such relief, as in the

benevolence of His Majesty King George the Third's Commissioners, his

losses and services may be found to deserve, and that he and the

subjoined witnesses may have a hearing from your Honourable Board."

As far as can be gathered from documentary evidence, and what

information could be obtained otherwise, no relief was ever granted to

Captain Godfrey or his family by the Commission of Losses and Services

of the American Loyalists. Mrs. Godfrey, whose many trials, hardships,

disappointments and sorrows, have been sketched in the foregoing

chapters, was living in London as late as 1805. A letter written by the

old lady to her son Charlie's wife, then living in Nova Scotia, was for

a few hours in the possession of the writer of these chapters. In this

letter she states her many difficulties and the numerous applications on

her part to various Lords and other authorities seeking relief in her

distress. Many portions of the long, well written letter are touching

indeed.


The persistency of the grand old lady in doing her utmost to force the

rulers of the country to a settlement of her husband's claims is greatly

to be admired. Her letter cannot be read by any colonist without

feelings of pity and shame. In one part of the letter she says

Councillor Brand8 has given in my memorial to the treasury and I have

to wait till he gets an answer, and I pray God it will be a happy one,

but God knows what is best, and will, if we put all our trust in him,

guide us aright. The cursed Duke of Richmond is not dead yet.9


Mrs. Godfrey must have been near eighty years of age when this letter

was written. Thirty-five years had elapsed since her husband's first

loss in the colony, and nearly thirty years since he was driven out by

rebels and Indians.


Titles and pensions have been freely bestowed by English kings and

parliaments on men who have been daring and successful in Britain's

cause. If Captain Godfrey had performed no deeds worthy of a title or a

pension, he at least deserved to be reimbursed in part or in whole for

the losses he had sustained at the hands of rebels and savages. And it

is probable there were men and women in England who were styled Dukes

and Duchesses,—who wore orders on their breasts that covered less brave

and no more loyal hearts than those of Capt. and Margaret Godfrey. She

firmly supported and assisted her husband in his strict adherence to

King George the Third's cause, and faced the rebels like a Spartan and

defeated them in their designs at Grimross. Her tact, skill, courage and

cool determination in the midst of imminent danger were truly admirable.

She displayed the qualities of a born leader time and time again. In a

situation where she could seek no support she relied on her own

judgment, courage and faith. These sterling qualities brought to her aid

one who afterward proved to be a friend and guide. Alone at Fort

Frederick she defeated the designs of blood-thirsty savages by stepping

out of the Fort and standing unmoved and defiant amid a flight of

arrows. Her commanding presence and firm attitude won a savage to her

side. We can entertain no better wish for the memory of this Celtic

heroine, than that her name may be preserved, and her life and deeds in

the colony go down to the latest generation.


"Justin McCarthy in his concise and interesting work, Ireland's cause in

England's Parliament," says: "There is a charming poem by my friend

William Allingham, called Lawrence Bloomfield in Ireland," in which we

find a classic story, thrillingly told, as an illustration of the hero's

feeling on some subject of interest to his country. A Roman Emperor is

persecuted by the petition of a poor widowed woman, who prays for

redress of some wrong done to her and her children. The great emperor is

far too great, his mind is taken up too much with questions of imperial

interest, to have any leisure for examining into, or even for reading,

this poor woman's claim.


One morning he is riding forth of his palace gates, at the head of his

splendid retinue, and the widow comes in his way, right in his path, and

holds up her petition again, and implores him to read it. He will not

read, and is about to pass scornfully on, when she flings herself on the

ground before him, herself and her little children, just in front of his

horse's hoofs, and she declares that if he will not stay and hear her

prayer, he shall not pass on his way unless he passes over the bodies of

herself and children.


And then says Mr. Allingham, "the Roman," who must have had something of

the truly imperial in him, "wheeled his horse and heard."


Margaret Godfrey, the poor widowed woman, took up the petition of her

husband, and continued to pray for redress of wrong done her husband,

herself, and her children. For twenty years she continued in her prayer.

Read what the poor widowed woman says in another part of her letter to

her daughter-in-law, and see if the truly imperial is to be found in a

King or in England's noblemen, who for twenty years "heard and wheeled."


"I have been sick all winter and not able to help myself, and am very

ill at present. My illness has almost turned me, but if I had but half a

leg I'll do my duty toward my family."


In another letter written to her daughter-in-law not long after the

first, she says: "Tell Charles if he ever visits the mouth of the St.

John or old Fort Frederick, not to neglect for his mother's sake to

visit the grave of Paul Guidon. He knows the locality and may be able to

detect the spot where the hero sleeps. In my thoughts, God knows how

often I linger about that spot. Sacred indeed must be the earth that

mingles with the dust of such nobility. Were I present I would adorn his

last resting place with the early spring flowers. Many wintry storms

have passed above his grave. Spring time and summer have come and gone,

but he heeds them not.


"I feel that I am nearing the border land, and as I cross the stream I

believe I shall meet my husband and also my other protector standing

together on the shore to welcome me home, to a home where friends never

fail and where justice is administered in the highest perfection.


"It is my living desire, and by the blessing of God it shall be my dying

desire, to meet beyond on the fields of glory Paul Guidon and my dear

husband. No Briton ever lived who was more loyal to his King and

country, and trusted more fully in the honour of earthly Lords than

Charles Godfrey.


"It may be that I shall bye and by find Paul Guidon's name inscribed in

brighter characters on the columns that support the arches of the

heavens, than the names of some to whom my husband applied on earth for

redress of wrong.


"One of Briton's statesmen lately said, 'It is easy for my Lord C. or

Earl G. or Marquis B. or Lord H. with thousands upon thousands a year,

some of it either presently derived or inherited in sinecure

acquisitions from the public money to boast of their patriotism, and

keep aloof from temptation, but they do not know from what temptation

those have kept aloof who had equal pride, at least equal talents, and

not unequal passions, and nevertheless knew not in the course of their

lives what it was to have a shilling of their own, and in saying this he

wept.


"And so have I, a thousand times in silence wept, as the utmost energy

of my life has been exerted to cheer, to comfort and to encourage a

weeping heart-broken husband weighed down with misfortunes and poverty."


The grave has long ago closed over every member of the Godfrey family

who were among the English pioneer settlers of Acadia, and the history

of their lives might have slept with them, but for a trifling

circumstance. The old documents referred to and copied in the foregoing

chapters, are greatly defaced, and time is completing their destruction.

Many of them are scarcely legible, and it required the utmost patience

and perseverance to gather together the facts as narrated in this work.


LITTLE MAG'S DREAM AS INTERPRETED BY ONE OF THE LESTERS.


As the little widow narrated her dream to one of the Misses Lester, the

latter understood it to be something like the following: Mag saw a vast

land with wooded hills and dales, green fields, lakes and rivers. Her

departed husband was quickly crossing over all these toward the setting

sun. He sped over the lakes and rivers in his canoe, and when he

emerged from among the trees, his bow and arrow hung across his

shoulder, over the open country he travelled in his moccasins, with the

old flag wrapped tightly about his breast and shoulders. At length he

approached the setting sun, where she lost sight of him for a moment,

the darkness that had gradually settled down, shutting out from her view

the passage of her husband, quick as a flash burst into a beautiful

crystal light. The heavens looked like shining silver, all around the

horizon was a wide cloud of clear light blue, with a border of gold.

Beneath was a broad expanse of green, with large groves of trees at

regular intervals dressed in a deeper shade. Through these were

meandering streams or rivers as of clear glass. Clear cut avenues ran

through at regular spaces from stream to stream, on the borders of which

(avenues and rivers) were thousands of jasper wigwams, sitting and

standing, at the front of each were Indians of all ages, dressed in pure

white and ornamented with precious stones of various hues. Rising above

the blue border of the sky, slowly and majestically, a new sun was

beaming. On its face stood Paul Guidon, in a dress of glistening

whiteness. The dress was after the pattern of that of an Indian chief.

Out of his right shoulder rose a red cross slanting slightly outward, on

the top of which stood an angel slightly inclining foreward. In his

right hand he held a wreath made of flowers most pure and white, inside

of which in letters of light blue, was the word Love. Out of his left

shoulder, in the same direction, rose a staff of deep blue, to which was

attached a drooping silver flag crossed with bars of gold. (Its pattern

was like the one placed in his grave.) On the top of the staff rested a

dove, holding in its beak a wreath, composed of rainbow shades, circling

the word Peace in letters whiter than snow. As the new sun continued to

rise, the jewelled sky increased in dazzling brilliancy, ten thousand

gems of shining gold shot out, and ten thousand sapphires too, all

glistening gloriously in the new light. The jasper tents on the

everlasting hunting grounds, and the motionless streams were brightning

with living flame. Thousands of Indians, strong and fair, in countless

groupings, seemed, to surpass even the sky itself in their glittering

starry dress.


Paul Guidon appeared to move his head forward as the star-paved sky

increased in burning brightness, till overpowered by the lustre shining,

and dazzled by the increasing brilliancy. Little Mag fell to the floor

and awoke in the darkened room. As she was in the act of falling the

faint sound of distant music, mingled with the noise of far away rushing

waters, seemed to fall upon her ears, increasing in strength and melody

as she touched the floor.


If Milman's lines had been written or known at the time of Mag's dream,

they could have been most suitably recited.


               "From all the harping throng 
               Bursts the tumultuous song, 
     Like the unceasing sound of cataracts pouring, 
     Hosanna o'er hosanna louder roaring. 
     That faintly echoing down to earthly ears, 
     Hath seemed the concert sweet of the harmonious spheres." 


    CHAPTER XII.


    MARRIAGE OF LITTLE MAG.—SOCIETY AT HALIFAX.


Soon after Mrs. Godfrey's departure from Parr Town for England, Little

Mag Guidon went up the St. John and settled there with some of the

tribe, intending to remain until a chance of getting back to her people

occurred. She was not destined, however, to go back to her Chippewayan

friends. Jim Newall, who had so often paddled her to the settlement and

back, made advances toward her, which she reciprocated till it ended in

the two being married. It appears she had won Jim's heart during the

illness of her husband. She told one of the Lesters, shortly after

Margaret Godfrey's departure, that Newall had said to her one evening

while going up to the camp from the mouth of the river, "Supposem, may

be, husband Paul die, Jim Newall come wigwam." She replied, "When Paul

die, no wigwam be there, won't stay 'lone." Jim answered, "Me, you, two

keep wigwam supposem." Doubtless, the above conversation laid the

foundation of their union. It proved to be a happy one. In a letter from

a friend to Mrs. Godfrey, a few months after her arrival home, it is

stated that "Jim and Mag appear to be the happiest of mortals, their's

is true love." The lady who wrote the above, evidently did not consider

"marriage a failure," especially among the Indians. In matters of

citizenship, in matters of human life, in matters of society, it may be,

that it would be beneficial to take a lesson or two from the lives of

the Iroquois, Chippewayan, and Mic-Mac. We certainly never read or hear

that marriage has been a failure among the Indians.


When Mrs. Godfrey bade farewell to Mag Guidon, she handed her name

and address, written in large, bold hand, and remarked as she handed it,

"Whenever you want to send me any message, if you are about here, get

some of my friends to write a letter for you."


While Mrs. Godfrey was at Parr Town she sought an interview with the

newly appointed Governor, (Thomas Carleton), who had arrived a few days

before to her departure. She made known to the Governor the losses

sustained and hardships endured by her husband while in the colony. She

also stated to Colonel Carleton the noble deeds of Paul Guidon, and of

his loyalty to the king. She told of his death and of the destitute

condition of his young widow.


Some months after Mrs. Godfrey had sailed for home, Governor Carleton

was told that the widow of Paul Guidon was soon to be married. He sent

to a friend of Mrs. Godfrey for information, and found the report to be

true. In a few days the Governor called at the house of the friend and

handed to her three guineas, to be expended for Little Mag's comfort.


This friend Mag usually called in to see when she came to the

settlement. She was told of the Governor's thoughtful kindness. Mag told

the friend to use the money in purchasing her wedding outfit. Not many

weeks later Mag Guidon was married to Jim Newall.


One afternoon the Governor received a note asking him if he would care

to see Little Mag in her wedding costume. He at once replied, naming a

day and hour that it would be convenient for him to receive the bride.


At the appointed time Little Mag and her pale faced friend appeared in

presence of His Excellency, who received them in the most gentleman-like

manner.


The bride, before leaving the presence of Governor Carleton, handed to

him Mrs. Godfrey's address, and asked him if he would send a letter to

her English mother, (Mag), and tell her that little Mag was married to

Jim Newall, and is living on the old camping ground where Paul died.

That Little Mag is happy and loves Jim as she did Paul. The Governor

promised Mrs. Newall that he would send a letter to Mrs. Godfrey. He

took the address and not long after wrote to Mrs. Godfrey, giving that

lady a full account of Little Mag's appearance as she stood in his

presence decked in her wedding garments.


Governor Carleton states in his letter that he never thought of seeing

so handsome a woman among the Indian tribes of America. That he believes

there are ladies in his own country who would almost feel inclined to

forfeit a title or an estate to be possessed of a pair of hands and feet

of the form and size of those of Newall's bride. Nature seemed to have

perfected its work in moulding the form and features of the handsome

squaw. The Governor continues, "She was dressed in a suit of navy blue

cloth, her skirt reaching to within an inch of the tops of her

moccasins. A loose blue cloth jacket, buttoned up in front with brass

buttons, covered her well rounded shoulders and breast. The jacket was

edged with scarlet cloth and reached to her waist. Around her full neck

hung a double row of beads, to which was attached a gold cross,10 and

on each wrist she wore a bracelet of beads similar to the neck-lace. A

wampum band circled her head. Inside the band were three beautiful

feathers from the wing of a wild pigeon. Her hair as black as the

raven's back, was so arranged as to make her forehead appear like an

equilatiral triangle, the brows being the base. Her eyes, coal black,

round, quick and deep set, are indescribable, and a more beautiful set

of teeth I never saw in a human head. On her feet she wore light brown

moccasins, on the front of each was worked, in beads of suitable

colours, the Union Jack. As she put out her neat foot that I might

better observe the work on her moccasins, she said the work was put on

them by her wish out of respect to the flag that covered the remains of

her first husband, (Paul Guidon). In her own words she said to me: "Tell

mother in England, she see Jim Newall and know Jim; saw him when my Paul

sick and die. He paddled English mother down settlement in canoe."


  "Your letter of 5th August, I received, and will make further inquiries

  as you advise about the property." The letter is addressed as follows:


Mrs. Charles Godfrey, * * *

    Care of Charles Godfrey, * * * Esq,

      (Late of His Majesty's Service),

        Kinsale,

          County Cork, Ireland.


The above is the substance of the Governor's letter to Mrs. Godfrey. The

date and first three or four lines of it were torn off and gone, and the

remainder was, with great difficulty, deciphered, the letter being in

several pieces and quite ragged. This letter must have been written in

the year 1785 or '86, as in a letter from a friend to Mrs. Godfrey,

dated September, 1785, Little Mag and her husband are said to have been

met in the street the day previous to writing. It is not at all likely

that little Mag was long married before she appeared in presence of

Governor Carleton.


Had Margaret Newall moved in a more elevated social sphere, and been

surrounded by wealthy parents and rich relatives, possibly Governor

Carleton would have been obliged to give Mrs. Godfrey a vivid

description of Mag's trousseau, and her beautiful presents of gold,

silver, diamonds, etc. But her parents and friends were poor. Her old

father possessed only a moving tent, occuping here and there, as he

found a spot to pitch it, a few square feet of King George the Third's

wilderness. Old Reonadi was not a commercial man. He had never made an

assignment. He was born one hundred years too soon to be surrounded by

commercial morality, perfect holiness and paternal affection. It took a

later generation of Chippewayans to display that care for their

posterity which only disguises an habitual avarice, or hides the

workings of a low and grovelling nature.


During neither of the stays that the Godfreys made at Halifax had

society reached that brilliant epoch it afterwards attained when that

Royal Duke, who set such an example of duty to all men, was making it

his temporary home. That for a colony was, from all accounts, indeed a

brilliant, gay, and polished society which was assembled at old Chebucto

when the Duke of Kent was at the head of the army in British North

America. Pleasure, however, was not the only occupation of that then

brilliant capital, at whose head was one so much devoted to duty, that

in its fulfilment he acquired the reputation of a martinet. This was the

day of the early morning parade, particularly irksome in a cold climate

to those who were obliged to turn out before daybreak in the bitter

weather of mid-winter. At this day, also, there were frequent troopings

of colours, marchings out, sham fights, and all the other martial

circumstances of a fully garrisoned town.


The maintenance of this strict discipline among the garrison whom he

commanded, was not more characteristic of the Duke than his affable

condescension and the considerate kindness that he displayed toward the

inhabitants of Nova Scotia, and of Quebec also, when he occupied its

castle. So that his name and memory are still held dear by the loyal

descendants of the men to whom Prince Edward was a familiar figure,

both at Halifax and Quebec, as he rode through the streets of either

town.


But Halifax, even at the time whereof we speak, so soon after its first

being rescued from the primeval forest, was not without its charms for

those who, like the Godfreys, had enjoyed the amenities of polished

circles. But the almost destitute circumstances in which they found

themselves when these visits were made, precluded them from entering

into many of the enjoyments that offered. However, there were a few

entertainments at which their position in society seemed to demand their

presence, and which they accordingly attended. Here, of course, they met

the heads of society, as well as many strangers from Boston, Quebec and

other places on the continent, nearly all of whom would be persons of

distinction in the several places where they hailed from. At this time

several tea gardens about Halifax furnished the means of quiet

recreation to the public. Adlam's garden, adjacent to the citadel, was

the most famous of these resorts, and here on one occasion when the

Godfreys were at Halifax, a garden party was given by one of the leaders

of ton, at which Captain Godfrey and his wife were privileged to meet,

among other distinguished personages, General Massie and Mr Arbuthnot,

the governor of the province. The ladies were richly attired. The

military wore their undress uniforms and the civilians were in full

dress, which consisted in that day of knee-breeches, silk stockings, and

shoes with buckles composed of silver or gold, set with brilliants or

other precious stones; the waistcoat was often of silk, satin or velvet,

richly brocaded or embroidered; the coat of blue cloth, with gilt

buttons; and a sword was not wanting to complete the costume.


It was difficult to decide at banquet or ball which presented the more

imposing appearance, the man of war or he whose avocation was of a

peaceful character, so nice were the dresses of both.


Margaret Godfrey did not forget her situation. Roaming about the lawns

and walks in a plain gown, and seeing the plainness of her own attire as

compared with those of the ladies about her, she retired to an obscure

corner of the grounds, feeling more happy under the circumstances in a

private nook than in the midst of gay and polished society. Although she

was clever, graceful and lively, she felt that the society in the

capital was, in some respects, ill-assorted. She thought the conduct of

some of the gentlemen and ladies was not wholly unimpeachable, while her

solid faith in the virtues of most of the ladies and gentlemen she met

from time to time during her stay never wavered.


    A CONCLUDING CHAPTER.


    THEN, NOW, AND TO BE.


How often do we hear of the deeds of the fathers of the country. How

often we read of them. And how little in comparison is said or written

of the hardships endured and the heroism displayed by the mothers. In

the early colonial days the women endured equal trials with the men. It

is possible that if the lives of the early settlers and the scenes of

those times were in full laid before us for review, we would find many

instances in which women displayed even greater courage than the men,

and in enduring the most severe privations and dangers, held out even

longer.


Had Captain Godfrey not been possessed with such a companion as his

wife, it seems almost certain he would have been made a prisoner and,

perhaps, been murdered. Her tact and perseverance in danger secured his

liberty and rescued him from death.


When her friends in London tried hard to persuade her from accompanying

her husband on his second venture in the colony, she calmly replied:

"Where my husband goes I can follow, if it be in the wilderness among

savages, or even through fire and blood. I love my husband, and wherever

he may be, to that spot I am attracted more strongly than to any

other." How much these brave words sound like those of Madame Cadillac,

spoken three quarters of a century earlier.


On the 24th of July, 1701, Cadillac landed at Detroit, and set himself

to found the place. Soon after this Madame Cadillac, who had been left

behind at Quebec, plunged into the wilderness to rejoin her husband.


It was a thousand miles in a birch bark canoe rowed by half-clad

Indians, and the route was through a dense forest and over great waters

swept by the September storms, but this brave woman undertook the

journey attended by only a single female companion.


When subsequently reminded of its hazards and hardships, she simply

replied: "A woman who loves her husband as she should, has no stronger

attraction than his company, where ever he may be."


The rich heritage we enjoy comes to us through the great efforts of

patriotism and dogged perseverance of our ancestors (the fathers and

mothers of the country). As we in gratitude remember the former, let us

not forget the latter.


Margaret Godfrey died in London about the year 1807, having survived her

husband fully twenty years. She was beloved by friends, and esteemed by

all who came in contact with her. She sank full of years undimmed by

failure and unclouded by reverses. Who can think of such persons as Mrs.

Godfrey without acknowledging that such are the true nobility of the

human race!


And now, when from the long distance of a hundred years or more, we

look back upon the hardships and misfortunes endured by one family of

the early colonists, we feel assured that pen and tongue can never make

fully known to us or our posterity the extent of the misery and

suffering of most of the early colonial settlers.11


We know enough, however, to admire the heroism of our ancestors and

their firm attachment to the mother land. Our hearts should warm with

gratitude for what they have done for our happiness. And as we consider

the unflinching determination of the founders of these British colonies

to make this land a British home, we feel that we should as

unflinchingly carry on their work and expand their views. Deeply rooted

in the hearts of our ancestors was a love of the old land, and their

desire in the new was to build upon the foundations of the old.


We, under Providence, are commissioned to carry forward the work they

left unfinished.


This land was the home of our fathers and shall be the heritage of our

children. The provincial spirit of our ancestors is being merged into a

great national one. A grand idea of nationality is being deeply rooted

in the hearts of the present generation. We are preparing for all the

responsibilities and all the works of a nation, and whether our

political union with the mother country becomes weaker or stronger as

the years pass by, our love for the old land will never cease. We are

proud of our parentage. Proud of the Celtic and Saxon blood that courses

through our veins.


As our country expands, and as we continue to build, may our love of

country widen, and the light of patriotism that brightened and cheered

the hearts of our ancestors as they toiled on, brighten and deeper burn

in all our hearts, and one grand illumination throw its rays upon the

surface of two oceans.


A neighbouring nation may envy our progress and seek our union, but this

will only stimulate our energy and strengthen the bonds that bind

British Americans together.


Our fathers left us a few disunited provinces, our children will inherit

a vast dominion, bounded east and west by the world's two great seas.


In even less time than it took our ancestors a century ago to travel

from Halifax to the mouth of the St John, we can plant our feet on the

shore of the Pacific.


The stars and stripes may wave along our Southern boundary, and there

shall their proud waves be stayed


     The Eagle may be lord below, 
     But the young Lion lord above. 


We rest firm in the belief that the decree has gone forth out of the

court of heaven, that the flag which was wrapped in its folds around the

"Young Lion of the Woods" in his last sleep, shall wave triumphantly

over Canada till peoples and nations cease to exist on earth.


The provinces in which the heroic events related in the foregoing

chapters occurred, now partake of the fortunes and sentiments and

character of a vast country. They live together with Canada, they

flourish with her, and if they are ever called upon to oppose a mightier

foe than Red men and Rebels, they will not be found unequal to the

occasion.


Never was nobler duty confided to human hands than that which was

confided to our ancestors more than a century ago. It was theirs under

providence to commence the foundations on which we are building, and in

the record of our social, industrial, educational, political and

religious progress we await with confidence the verdict of the world.


Although for the greater portion of the century the growth of the

British North American Colonies has been slow, yet it has been sound,

and it will be better for Canada in the future if the growth is not too

rapid. If the process of consolidation takes place regularly and

moderately, every institution in the land will be sounder. If the

majority of the immigrants which the country annually receives are

similar in character and principles to those of the early colonists, we

shall have nothing to fear in the future. We have nothing in our past

history to discourage us, and much in our present condition and

prospects to stimulate us. We who are privileged to live in the closing

years of the century behold a wonderful unity and an extraordinary

advancement of the whole Dominion in all its great interests. And the

man, if such there be, who was born on this soil and sprung from such an

ancestry as the early colonial settlers and United Empire Loyalists, or

from the loins of settlers of a later generation, who is not proud of

his country and of being called a British American, is unworthy of his

race and the land of his birth, and unworthy of having his name classed

with that of the noble Iroquois (Paul Guidon.) There are persons who

have acted a less noble part in life's drama, than the British officer

and his wife who settled at Grimross Neck, and even a less noble part

than Paul Guidon, who have won golden wreaths for their tombs, and since

Margaret Godfrey's name and deeds have been dug from oblivion, should

they be forgotten or the Iroquois tomb go unadorned?


Our past in its three great eras, that of settlement, Responsible

government and union, shows grand steps in the country's triumphant

march. If with decaying sectional spirit, the grand idea of British

American independence takes hold of the minds and hearts of the people,

this would be found the gradual power that would impel the country to

its national destiny. As we behold mighty provinces forming and splendid

cities rising, we begin more fully to realize the glorious career on

which the Dominion has entered, these events should compel, yea they

announce a safe, wise and splendid future.


The few millions who have sprung from those who founded the colonies,

trace back with lineal love their blood to them. So may it be in the

distant future millions more will look back with pride and trace their

blood through those who formed a nation in peace, to those who founded

the colonies, and to those who formed the union.


We may read of the past, write of the past, and think of the past. To do

so is often profitable; it is also a pleasure. But, as we admire the

spirit and works of those who have passed beyond the flood, we should

more earnestly prepare for the future. "The sleeping and the dead are

but pictures." "Yet, gazing on these long and intently, and often we may

pass into the likeness of the departed, may stimulate their labors, and

partake of their immortality."


     "The growing nation, may it prove Dominion of the Good! 
     And ever stand, in coming years, where Britain always stood,— 
     The foremost in the cause of right! upholder of the truth! 
     The nation which in growth of years grows in the strength of youth! 
     Then we may cry, with hopeful voice, unto the heavenly powers, 
     For blessings on our native land—'This Canada of ours.'" 


FINIS.

It will be remembered that during the voyage from the mouth

of the St John to Grimross Neck, the Captain's wife was most anxious to

be on deck alone during the hours of darkness. The Iroquois and several

braves appeared before Fort Frederick on the afternoon of the day that

Captain Godfrey left for Annapolis Royal. They ran round and round the

place, calling upon the occupants of the Fort to come out, or they would

break in and murder them. The Captain's wife determined to go outside

and face the savages, but found it difficult to leave her terrified

children, who were afraid to follow her. She knew her only course was to

appear bold and fearless in presence of the red men. At length she got

the little ones pacified, as she stepped toward the opening, her

children were huddled together in a corner. She did not hesitate a

moment, but went out and advanced down the slope and stood face to face

with the savages. Paul Guidon advanced a few steps toward her. She said,

"I believe you to be an honest man, and you will not see a defenceless

woman injured and her children murdered, if you can help it." At this

moment a couple of tomahawks and several arrows passed in close

proximity to Mrs. Godfrey, and a moment after a single arrow struck her

in the arm, causing the blood to flow freely. Paul Guidon turned

suddenly and spoke firmly and decidedly to his comrades, they retired a

short distance. Margaret continued, "Why do those Indians wish to injure

me? My husband is away, and when he comes back we will leave this place

and go up the river to Grimross Neck and live there." The red man stood

silent all the time Mrs. Godfrey was speaking. He now spoke as follows,

"You no 'fraid Injuns, stand fore them like rock," at the same time

pointing down to a big boulder on which he was standing, "Brave Pale

Face." She said in reply: "I shall never be afraid while you are with

the Indians, but some of the red men I would not trust. If my King, the

Great Pale Faced Father of this country, knew of your kindness to me he

would love you. I feel that my life and the lives of my children are

safe in your hands." Margaret then asked him into the Fort. In doing

this she appears to have obeyed the cool dictates of judgment rather

than the impulses of the heart. He at first hesitated and then slowly

followed her cautiously up the rising ground. She turned around and said

to him rather sharply: "Do you fear to trust me? There are no pale faced

men inside. Did I not trust you when I went out single, alone and

unarmed, to meet you?" He quickened his pace, but glanced restlessly all

around. Arriving near the entrance of the Fort, he said: "Me stop here."

his restless eyes and said: "You are my friend now. When my husband

she would not. And she kept her word.
