HIS WORSHIP THE GOOSEDRIVER
I
It was an amiable but deceitful afternoon in the third week of

December. Snow fell heavily in the windows of confectioners' shops,

and Father Christmas smiled in Keats's Bazaar the fawning smile of

a myth who knows himself to be exploded; but beyond these and

similar efforts to remedy the forgetfulness of a careless climate,

there was no sign anywhere in the Five Towns, and especially in

Bursley, of the immediate approach of the season of peace,

goodwill, and gluttony on earth.
At the Tiger, next door to Keats's in the market-place, Mr.

Josiah Topham Curtenty had put down his glass (the port was kept

specially for him), and told his boon companion, Mr. Gordon, that

he must be going. These two men had one powerful sentiment 004 in

common: they loved the same woman. Mr. Curtenty, aged twenty-six in

heart, thirty-six in mind, and forty-six in looks, was fifty-six

only in years. He was a rich man; he had made money as an

earthenware manufacturer in the good old times before Satan was

ingenious enough to invent German competition, American tariffs,

and the price of coal; he was still making money with the aid of

his son Harry, who now managed the works, but he never admitted

that he was making it. No one has yet succeeded, and no one ever

will succeed, in catching an earthenware manufacturer in the act of

making money; he may confess with a sigh that he has performed the

feat in the past, he may give utterance to a vague, preposterous

hope that he will perform it again in the remote future, but as for

surprising him in the very act, you would as easily surprise a hen

laying an egg. Nowadays Mr. Curtenty, commercially secure, spent

most of his energy in helping to shape and control the high

destinies of the town. He was Deputy-Mayor, and Chairman of the

General Purposes Committee of the Town Council; he was also a

Guardian of the Poor, 005 a Justice of the

Peace, President of the Society for the Prosecution of Felons, a

sidesman, an Oddfellow, and several other things that meant dining,

shrewdness, and good-nature. He was a short, stiff, stout,

red-faced man, jolly with the jollity that springs from a kind

heart, a humorous disposition, a perfect digestion, and the

respectful deference of one's bank-manager. Without being a member

of the Browning Society, he held firmly to the belief that all's

right with the world.
Mr. Gordon, who has but a sorry part in the drama, was a

younger, quieter, less forceful person, rather shy; a municipal

mediocrity, perhaps a little inflated that day by reason of his

having been elected to the Chairmanship of the Gas and Lighting

Committee.
Both men had sat on their committees at the Town Hall across the

way that deceitful afternoon, and we see them now, after

refreshment well earned and consumed, about to separate and sink

into private life. But as they came out into the portico of the

Tiger, the famous Calypso-like barmaid of the Tiger a hovering

enchantment in the background, it occurred that a flock of geese

were meditating, 006 as geese will, in the middle of the road. The

gooseherd, a shabby middle-aged man, looked as though he had

recently lost the Battle of Marathon, and was asking himself

whether the path of his retreat might not lie through the

bar-parlour of the Tiger.
'Business pretty good?' Mr. Curtenty inquired of him

cheerfully.
In the Five Towns business takes the place of weather as a topic

of salutation.
'Business!' echoed the gooseherd.
In that one unassisted noun, scorning the aid of verb,

adjective, or adverb, the gooseherd, by a masterpiece of profound

and subtle emphasis, contrived to express the fact that he existed

in a world of dead illusions, that he had become a convert to

Schopenhauer, and that Mr. Curtenty's inapposite geniality was a

final grievance to him.
'There ain't no business!' he added.
'Ah!' returned Mr. Curtenty, thoughtful: such an assertion of

the entire absence of business was a reflection upon the town.
'Sithee!' said the gooseherd in ruthless accents, 'I druv these

'ere geese into this 'ere town this morning.' (Here he exaggerated

007

the number of miles traversed.) 'Twelve geese and two

gander—a Brent and a Barnacle. And how many is there now? How

many?'
'Fourteen,' said Mr. Gordon, having counted; and Mr. Curtenty

gazed at him in reproach, for that he, a Town Councillor, had thus

mathematically demonstrated the commercial decadence of

Bursley.
'Market overstocked, eh?' Mr. Curtenty suggested, throwing a

side-glance at Callear the poulterer's close by, which was crammed

with everything that flew, swam, or waddled.
'Call this a market?' said the gooseherd. 'I'st tak' my lot over

to Hanbridge, wheer there is a bit doing, by all

accounts.'
Now, Mr. Curtenty had not the least intention of buying those

geese, but nothing could be better calculated to straighten the

back of a Bursley man than a reference to the mercantile activity

of Hanbridge, that Chicago of the Five Towns.
'How much for the lot?' he inquired.
In that moment he reflected upon his reputation; he knew that he

was a cure, a card, a character; he knew that everyone would think

it just like Jos Curtenty, the renowned 008 Deputy-Mayor of

Bursley, to stand on the steps of the Tiger and pretend to chaffer

with a gooseherd for a flock of geese. His imagination caught the

sound of an oft-repeated inquiry, 'Did ye hear about old Jos's

latest—trying to buy them there geese?' and the appreciative

laughter that would follow.
The gooseherd faced him in silence.
'Well,' said Mr. Curtenty again, his eyes twinkling, 'how much

for the lot?'
The gooseherd gloomily and suspiciously named a sum.
Mr. Curtenty named a sum startlingly less, ending in

sixpence.
'I'll tak' it,' said the gooseherd, in a tone that closed on the

bargain like a vice.
The Deputy-Mayor perceived himself the owner of twelve geese and

two ganders—one Brent, one Barnacle. It was a shock, but he

sustained it. Involuntarily he looked at Mr. Gordon.
'How are you going to get 'em home, Curtenty?' asked Gordon,

with coarse sarcasm; 'drive 'em?'
Nettled, Mr. Curtenty retorted:
'Now, then, Gas Gordon!'
009 The barmaid laughed aloud at this sobriquet,

which that same evening was all over the town, and which has stuck

ever since to the Chairman of the Gas and Lighting Committee. Mr.

Gordon wished, and has never ceased to wish, either that he had

been elected to some other committee, or that his name had begun

with some other letter.
The gooseherd received the purchase-money like an affront, but

when Mr. Curtenty, full of private mirth, said, 'Chuck us your

stick in,' he give him the stick, and smiled under reservation. Jos

Curtenty had no use for the geese; he could conceive no purpose

which they might be made to serve, no smallest corner for them in

his universe. Nevertheless, since he had rashly stumbled into a

ditch, he determined to emerge from it grandly, impressively,

magnificently. He instantaneously formed a plan by which he would

snatch victory out of defeat. He would take Gordon's suggestion,

and himself drive the geese up to his residence in Hillport, that

lofty and aristocratic suburb. It would be an immense, an

unparalleled farce; a wonder, a topic for years, the crown of his

reputation as a card.
010 He announced his intention with that

misleading sobriety and ordinariness of tone which it has been the

foible of many great humorists to assume. Mr. Gordon lifted his

head several times very quickly, as if to say, 'What next?' and

then actually departed, which was a clear proof that the man had no

imagination and no soul.
The gooseherd winked.
'You be rightly called "Curtenty," mester,' said he, and passed

into the Tiger.
'That's the best joke I ever heard,' Jos said to himself 'I

wonder whether he saw it.'
Then the procession of the geese and the Deputy-Mayor commenced.

Now, it is not to be assumed that Mr. Curtenty was necessarily

bound to look foolish in the driving of geese. He was no

nincompoop. On the contrary, he was one of those men who, bringing

common-sense and presence of mind to every action of their lives,

do nothing badly, and always escape the ridiculous. He marshalled

his geese with notable gumption, adopted towards them exactly the

correct stress of persuasion, and presently he smiled to see them

preceding him in the direction 011 of Hillport. He

looked neither to right nor left, but simply at his geese, and thus

the quidnuncs of the market-place and the supporters of shop-fronts

were unable to catch his eye. He tried to feel like a gooseherd;

and such was his histrionic quality, his instinct for the dramatic,

he was a gooseherd, despite his blue Melton overcoat, his

hard felt hat with the flattened top, and that opulent-curving

collar which was the secret despair of the young dandies of

Hillport. He had the most natural air in the world. The geese were

the victims of this imaginative effort of Mr. Curtenty's. They took

him seriously as a gooseherd. These fourteen intelligences, each

with an object in life, each bent on self-aggrandisement and the

satisfaction of desires, began to follow the line of least

resistance in regard to the superior intelligence unseen but felt

behind them, feigning, as geese will, that it suited them so to

submit, and that in reality they were still quite independent. But

in the peculiar eye of the Barnacle gander, who was leading, an

observer with sufficient fancy might have deciphered a mild revolt

against this triumph of the absurd, the accidental, and 012 the

futile; a passive yet Promethean spiritual defiance of the supreme

powers.
Mr. Curtenty got his fourteen intelligences safely across the

top of St. Luke's Square, and gently urged them into the steep

defile of Oldcastle Street. By this time rumour had passed in front

of him and run off down side-streets like water let into an

irrigation system. At every corner was a knot of people, at most

windows a face. And the Deputy-Mayor never spoke nor smiled. The

farce was enormous; the memory of it would survive revolutions and

religions.
Halfway down Oldcastle Street the first disaster happened.

Electric tramways had not then knitted the Five Towns in a network

of steel; but the last word of civilization and refinement was

about to be uttered, and a gang of men were making patterns with

wires on the skyscape of Oldcastle Street. One of the wires,

slipping from its temporary gripper, swirled with an extraordinary

sound into the roadway, and writhed there in spirals. Several of

Mr. Curtenty's geese were knocked down, and rose obviously annoyed;

but the Barnacle gander fell with a clinging circle of wire round

his 013 muscular, glossy neck, and did not rise again.

It was a violent, mysterious, agonizing, and sudden death for him,

and must have confirmed his theories about the arbitrariness of

things. The thirteen passed pitilessly on. Mr. Curtenty freed the

gander from the coiling wire, and picked it up, but, finding it far

too heavy to carry, he handed it to a Corporation road-sweeper.
'I'll send for it,' he said; 'wait here.'
These were the only words uttered by him during a memorable

journey.
The second disaster was that the deceitful afternoon turned to

rain—cold, cruel rain, persistent rain, full of sinister

significance. Mr. Curtenty ruefully raised the velvet of his

Melton. As he did so a brougham rolled into Oldcastle Street, a

little in front of him, from the direction of St. Peter's Church,

and vanished towards Hillport. He knew the carriage; he had bought

it and paid for it. Deep, far down, in his mind stirred the

thought:
'I'm just the least bit glad she didn't see me.'
He had the suspicion, which recurs even to optimists, that

happiness is after all a chimera.
The third disaster was that the sun set and 
014 darkness

descended. Mr. Curtenty had, unfortunately, not reckoned with this

diurnal phenomenon; he had not thought upon the undesirability of

being under compulsion to drive geese by the sole illumination of

gas-lamps lighted by Corporation gas.
After this disasters multiplied. Dark and the rain had

transformed the farce into something else. It was five-thirty when

at last he reached The Firs, and the garden of The Firs was filled

with lamentable complainings of a remnant of geese. His man Pond

met him with a stable-lantern.
'Damp, sir,' said Pond.
'Oh, nowt to speak of,' said Mr. Curtenty, and, taking off his

hat, he shot the fluid contents of the brim into Pond's face. It

was his way of dotting the 'i' of irony. 'Missis come in?'
'Yes, sir; I have but just rubbed the horse down.'
So far no reference to the surrounding geese, all forlorn in the

heavy winter rain.
'I've gotten a two-three geese and one gander here for

Christmas,' said Mr. Curtenty after a pause. To inferiors he always

used the dialect.
015 'Yes, sir.'
'Turn 'em into th' orchard, as you call it.'
'Yes, sir.'
'They aren't all here. Thou mun put th' horse in the trap and

fetch the rest thysen.'
'Yes, sir.'
'One's dead. A roadman's takkin' care on it in Oldcastle Street.

He'll wait for thee. Give him sixpence.'
'Yes, sir.'
'There's another got into th' cut [canal].'
'Yes, sir.'
'There's another strayed on the railway-line—happen it's

run over by this.'
'Yes, sir.'
'And one's making the best of her way to Oldcastle. I couldna

coax her in here.'
'Yes, sir.'
'Collect 'em.'
'Yes, sir.'
Mr. Curtenty walked away towards the house.
'Mester!' Pond called after him, flashing the lantern.
'Well, lad?'
'There's no gander i' this lot.'
016 'Hast forgotten to count thysen?' Mr. Curtenty

answered blithely from the shelter of the side-door.
But within himself he was a little crest-fallen to think that

the surviving gander should have escaped his vigilance, even in the

darkness. He had set out to drive the geese home, and he had driven

them home, most of them. He had kept his temper, his dignity, his

cheerfulness. He had got a bargain in geese. So much was

indisputable ground for satisfaction. And yet the feeling of an

anticlimax would not be dismissed. Upon the whole, his transit

lacked glory. It had begun in splendour, but it had ended in

discomfort and almost ignominy. Nevertheless, Mr. Curtenty's

unconquerable soul asserted itself in a quite genuine and tuneful

whistle as he entered the house.
The fate of the Brent gander was never ascertained.
II
The dining-room of The Firs was a spacious and inviting

refectory, which owed nothing of its charm to William Morris,

Regent Street, 017 or the Arts and Crafts Society. Its triple

aim, was richness, solidity, and comfort, but especially comfort;

and this aim was achieved in new oak furniture of immovable

firmness, in a Turkey carpet which swallowed up the feet like a

feather bed, and in large oil-paintings, whose darkly-glinting

frames were a guarantee of their excellence. On a winter's night,

as now, the room was at its richest, solidest, most comfortable.

The blue plush curtains were drawn on their stout brass rods across

door and French window. Finest selected silkstone fizzed and flamed

in a patent grate which had the extraordinary gift of radiating

heat into the apartment instead of up the chimney. The shaded

Welsbach lights of the chandelier cast a dazzling luminance on the

tea-table of snow and silver, while leaving the pictures in a gloom

so discreet that not Ruskin himself could have decided whether

these were by Whistler or Peter Paul Rubens. On either side of the

marble mantelpiece were two easy-chairs of an immense, incredible

capacity, chairs of crimson plush for Titans, chairs softer than

moss, more pliant than a loving heart, more enveloping than a

caress. In one of 018 these chairs, that to the left of the

fireplace, Mr. Curtenty was accustomed to snore every Saturday and

Sunday afternoon, and almost every evening. The other was usually

empty, but to-night it was occupied by Mrs. Curtenty, the jewel of

the casket. In the presence of her husband she always used a small

rocking-chair of ebonized cane.
To glance at this short, slight, yet plump little creature as

she reclined crosswise in the vast chair, leaving great spaces of

the seat unfilled, was to think rapturously to one's self: This

is a woman. Her fluffy head was such a dot against the back of

the chair, the curve of her chubby ringed hand above the head was

so adorable, her black eyes were so provocative, her slippered feet

so wee—yes, and there was something so mysteriously thrilling

about the fall of her skirt that you knew instantly her name was

Clara, her temper both fiery and obstinate, and her personality

distracting. You knew that she was one of those women of frail

physique who can endure fatigues that would destroy a camel; one of

those dæmonic women capable of doing without sleep for ten

nights in order to nurse you; capable of dying and 019 seeing

you die rather than give way about the tint of a necktie; capable

of laughter and tears simultaneously; capable of never being in the

wrong except for the idle whim of so being. She had a big mouth and

very wide nostrils, and her years were thirty-five. It was no

matter; it would have been no matter had she been a hundred and

thirty-five. In short....
Clara Curtenty wore tight-fitting black silk, with a long gold

chain that descended from her neck nearly to her waist, and was

looped up in the middle to an old-fashioned gold brooch. She was in

mourning for a distant relative. Black pre-eminently suited her.

Consequently her distant relatives died at frequent intervals.
The basalt clock on the mantelpiece trembled and burst into the

song of six. Clara Curtenty rose swiftly from the easy-chair, and

took her seat in front of the tea-tray. Almost at the same moment a

neat black-and-white parlourmaid brought in teapot, copper kettle,

and a silver-covered dish containing hot pikelets; then departed.

Clara was alone again; not the same Clara now, but a personage

demure, prim, precise, frightfully upright of back—a 020 sort of

impregnable stronghold—without doubt a Deputy-Mayoress.
At five past six Josiah Curtenty entered the room, radiant from

a hot bath, and happy in dry clothes—a fine, if mature,

figure of a man. His presence filled the whole room.
'Well, my chuck!' he said, and kissed her on the cheek.
She gazed at him with a look that might mean anything. Did she

raise her cheek to his greeting, or was it fancy that she had

endured, rather than accepted, his kiss? He was scarcely sure. And

if she had endured instead of accepting the kiss, was her mood to

be attributed to his lateness for tea, or to the fact that she was

aware of the episode of the geese? He could not divine.
'Pikelets! Good!' he exclaimed, taking the cover off the

dish.
This strong, successful, and dominant man adored his wife, and

went in fear of her. She was his first love, but his second spouse.

They had been married ten years. In those ten years they had

quarrelled only five times, and she had changed the very colour of

his life. Till his second marriage he had boasted that 021 he

belonged to the people and retained the habits of the people.

Clara, though she also belonged to the people, very soon altered

all that. Clara had a passion for the genteel. Like many

warm-hearted, honest, clever, and otherwise sensible persons, Clara

was a snob, but a charming little snob. She ordered him to forget

that he belonged to the people. She refused to listen when he

talked in the dialect. She made him dress with opulence, and even

with tidiness; she made him buy a fashionable house and fill it

with fine furniture; she made him buy a brougham in which her

gentility could pay calls and do shopping (she shopped in

Oldcastle, where a decrepit aristocracy of tradesmen sneered at

Hanbridge's lack of style); she had her 'day'; she taught the

servants to enter the reception-rooms without knocking; she took

tea in bed in the morning, and tea in the afternoon in the

drawing-room. She would have instituted dinner at seven, but she

was a wise woman, and realized that too much tyranny often means

revolution and the crumbling of-thrones; therefore the ancient

plebeian custom of high tea at six was allowed to persist and

continue.
022 She it was who had compelled Josiah (or

bewitched, beguiled, coaxed and wheedled him), after a public

refusal, to accept the unusual post of Deputy-Mayor. In two years'

time he might count on being Mayor. Why, then, should Clara have

been so anxious for this secondary dignity? Because, in that year

of royal festival, Bursley, in common with many other boroughs, had

had a fancy to choose a Mayor out of the House of Lords. The Earl

of Chell, a magnate of the county, had consented to wear the

mayoral chain and dispense the mayoral hospitalities on condition

that he was provided with a deputy for daily use.
It was the idea of herself being deputy to the lovely,

meddlesome, and arrogant Countess of Chell that had appealed to

Clara.
The deputy of a Countess at length spoke.
'Will Harry be late at the works again to-night?' she asked in

her colder, small-talk manner, which committed her to nothing, as

Josiah well knew.
Her way of saying that word 'Harry' was inimitably significant.

She gave it an air. She liked Harry, and she liked Harry's name,

because it had a Kensingtonian sound. Harry, 023 so accomplished in

business, was also a dandy, and he was a dog. 'My

stepson'—she loved to introduce him, so tall, manly,

distinguished, and dandiacal. Harry, enriched by his own mother,

belonged to a London club; he ran down to Llandudno for week-ends;

and it was reported that he had been behind the scenes at the

Alhambra. Clara felt for the word 'Harry' the unreasoning affection

which most women lavish on 'George.'
'Like as not,' said Josiah. 'I haven't been to the works this

afternoon.'
Another silence fell, and then Josiah, feeling himself unable to

bear any further suspense as to his wife's real mood and temper,

suddenly determined to tell her all about the geese, and know the

worst. And precisely at the instant that he opened his mouth, the

maid opened the door and announced:
'Mr. Duncalf wishes to see you at once, sir. He won't keep you a

minute.'
'Ask him in here, Mary,' said the Deputy-Mayoress sweetly; 'and

bring another cup and saucer.'
Mr. Duncalf was the Town Clerk of Bursley: legal, portly, dry,

and a little shy.
024 'I won't stop, Curtenty. How d'ye do, Mrs.

Curtenty? No, thanks, really——' But she, smiling,

exquisitely gracious, flattered and smoothed him into a chair.
'Any interesting news, Mr. Duncalf?' she said, and added: 'But

we're glad that anything should have brought you in.'
'Well,' said Duncalf, 'I've just had a letter by the afternoon

post from Lord Chell.'
'Oh, the Earl! Indeed; how very interesting.'
'What's he after?' inquired Josiah cautiously.
'He says he's just been appointed Governor of East

Australia—announcement 'll be in to-morrow's papers—and

so he must regretfully resign the mayoralty. Says he'll pay the

fine, but of course we shall have to remit that by special

resolution of the Council.'
'Well, I'm damned!' Josiah exclaimed.
'Topham!' Mrs. Curtenty remonstrated, but with a delightful

acquitting dimple. She never would call him Josiah, much less Jos.

Topham came more easily to her lips, and sometimes Top.
'Your husband,' said Mr. Duncalf impressively to Clara, 'will,

of course, have to step 025 into the Mayor's

shoes, and you'll have to fill the place of the Countess.' He

paused, and added: 'And very well you'll do it, too—very

well. Nobody better.'
The Town Clerk frankly admired Clara.
'Mr. Duncalf—Mr. Duncalf!' She raised a finger at him.

'You are the most shameless flatterer in the town.'
The flatterer was flattered. Having delivered the weighty news,

he had leisure to savour his own importance as the bearer of it. He

drank a cup of tea. Josiah was thoughtful, but Clara brimmed over

with a fascinating loquacity. Then Mr. Duncalf said that he must

really be going, and, having arranged with the Mayor-elect to call

a special meeting of the Council at once, he did go, all the while

wishing he had the enterprise to stay.
Josiah accompanied him to the front-door. The sky had now

cleared.
'Thank ye for calling,' said the host.
'Oh, that's all right. Good-night, Curtenty. Got that goose out

of the canal?'
So the story was all abroad!
Josiah returned to the dining-room, imperceptibly smiling. At

the door the sight of 026 his wife halted him.

The face of that precious and adorable woman flamed out lightning

and all menace and offence. Her louring eyes showed what a triumph

of dissimulation she must have achieved in the presence of Mr.

Duncalf, but now she could speak her mind.
'Yes, Topham!' she exploded, as though finishing an harangue.

'And on this day of all days you choose to drive geese in the

public road behind my carriage!'
Jos was stupefied, annihilated.
'Did you see me, then, Clarry?'
He vainly tried to carry it off.
'Did I see you? Of course I saw you!'
She withered him up with the hot wind of scorn.
'Well,' he said foolishly, 'how was I to know that the Earl

would resign just to-day?'
'How were you to——?'
Harry came in for his tea. He glanced from one to the other,

discreet, silent. On the way home he had heard the tale of the

geese in seven different forms. The Deputy-Mayor, so soon to be

Mayor, walked out of the room.
027 'Pond has just come back, father,' said Harry;

'I drove up the hill with him.'
And as Josiah hesitated a moment in the hall, he heard Clara

exclaim, 'Oh, Harry!'
'Damn!' he murmured.

The Signal of the following day contained the

announcement which Mr. Duncalf had forecast; it also stated, on

authority, that Mr. Josiah Curtenty would wear the mayoral chain of

Bursley immediately, and added as its own private opinion that, in

default of the Right Honourable the Earl of Chell and his Countess,

no better 'civic heads' could have been found than Mr. Curtenty and

his charming wife. So far the tone of the Signal was

unimpeachable. But underneath all this was a sub-title, 'Amusing

Exploit of the Mayor-elect,' followed by an amusing description of

the procession of the geese, a description which concluded by

referring to Mr. Curtenty as His Worship the Goosedriver.
Hanbridge, Knype, Longshaw, and Turnhill laughed heartily, and

perhaps a little viciously, 028 at this paragraph,

but Bursley was annoyed by it. In print the affair did not look at

all well. Bursley prided itself on possessing a unique dignity as

the 'Mother of the Five Towns,' and to be presided over by a

goosedriver, however humorous and hospitable he might be, did not

consort with that dignity. A certain Mayor of Longshaw, years

before, had driven a sow to market, and derived a tremendous

advertisement therefrom, but Bursley had no wish to rival Longshaw

in any particular. Bursley regarded Longshaw as the Inferno of the

Five Towns. In Bursley you were bidden to go to Longshaw as you

were bidden to go to ... Certain acute people in Hillport saw

nothing but a paralyzing insult in the opinion of the Signal

(first and foremost a Hanbridge organ), that Bursley could find no

better civic head than Josiah Curtenty. At least three Aldermen and

seven Councillors privately, and in the Tiger, disagreed with any

such view of Bursley's capacity to find heads.
And underneath all this brooding dissatisfaction lurked the

thought, as the alligator lurks in a muddy river, that 'the Earl

wouldn't like it'—meaning the geese episode. It was 029

generally felt that the Earl had been badly treated by Jos

Curtenty. The town could not explain its sentiments—could not

argue about them. They were not, in fact, capable of logical

justification; but they were there, they violently existed. It

would have been useless to point out that if the inimitable Jos had

not been called to the mayoralty the episode of the geese would

have passed as a gorgeous joke; that everyone had been vastly

amused by it until that desolating issue of the Signal

announced the Earl's retirement; that Jos Curtenty could not

possibly have foreseen what was about to happen; and that, anyhow,

goosedriving was less a crime than a social solecism, and less a

social solecism than a brilliant eccentricity. Bursley was hurt,

and logic is no balm for wounds.
Some may ask: If Bursley was offended, why did it not mark its

sense of Josiah's failure to read the future by electing another

Mayor? The answer is, that while all were agreed that his antic was

inexcusable, all were equally agreed to pretend that it was a mere

trifle of no importance; you cannot deprive a man of his

prescriptive right for a mere trifle of no 030 importance. Besides,

nobody could be so foolish as to imagine that goosedriving, though

reprehensible in a Mayor about to succeed an Earl, is an act of

which official notice can be taken.
The most curious thing in the whole imbroglio is that Josiah

Curtenty secretly agreed with his wife and the town. He was

ashamed, overset. His procession of geese appeared to him in an

entirely new light, and he had the strength of mind to admit to

himself, 'I've made a fool of myself.'
Harry went to London for a week, and Josiah, under plea of his

son's absence, spent eight hours a day at the works. The brougham

remained in the coach-house.
The Town Council duly met in special conclave, and Josiah Topham

Curtenty became Mayor of Bursley.
Shortly after Christmas it was announced that the Mayor and

Mayoress had decided to give a New Year's treat to four hundred

poor old people in the St. Luke's covered market. It was also

spread about that this treat would eclipse and extinguish all

previous treats of a similar nature, and that it might be accepted

as some slight foretaste of the hospitality which 
031 the Mayor and

Mayoress would dispense in that memorable year of royal festival.

The treat was to occur on January 9, the Mayoress's birthday.
On January 7 Josiah happened to go home early. He was proceeding

into the drawing-room without enthusiasm to greet his wife, when he

heard voices within; and one voice was the voice of Gas Gordon.
Jos stood still. It has been mentioned that Gordon and the Mayor

were in love with the same woman. The Mayor had easily captured her

under the very guns of his not formidable rival, and he had always

thereafter felt a kind of benevolent, good-humoured, contemptuous

pity for Gordon—Gordon, whose life was a tragic blank;

Gordon, who lived, a melancholy and defeated bachelor, with his

mother and two unmarried sisters older than himself. That Gordon

still worshipped at the shrine did not disturb him; on the

contrary, it pleased him. Poor Gordon!
'But, really, Mrs. Curtenty,' Gordon was saying—'really,

you know I—that—is—really—'
'To please me!' Mrs. Curtenty entreated, 032 with a seductive

charm that Jos felt even outside the door.
Then there was a pause.
'Very well,' said Gordon.
Mr. Curtenty tiptoed away and back into the street. He walked in

the dark nearly to Oldcastle, and returned about six o'clock. But

Clara said no word of Gordon's visit. She had scarcely spoken to

Topham for three weeks.
The next morning, as Harry was departing to the works, Mrs.

Curtenty followed the handsome youth into the hall.
'Harry,' she whispered, 'bring me two ten-pound notes this

afternoon, will you, and say nothing to your father.'
IV
Gas Gordon was to be on the platform at the poor people's treat.

As he walked down Trafalgar Road his eye caught a still-exposed

fragment of a decayed bill on a hoarding. It referred to a meeting

of the local branch of the Anti-Gambling League a year ago in the

lecture-hall of the Wesleyan Chapel, and it said that Councillor

Gordon would occupy the 033 chair on that

occasion. Mechanically Councillor Gordon stopped and tore the

fragment away from the hoarding.
The treat, which took the form of a dinner, was an unqualified

success; it surpassed all expectations. Even the diners themselves

were satisfied—a rare thing at such affairs. Goose was a

prominent item in the menu. After the repast the replete guests

were entertained from the platform, the Mayor being, of course, in

the chair. Harry sang 'In Old Madrid,' accompanied by his

stepmother, with faultless expression. Mr. Duncalf astonished

everybody with the famous North-Country recitation, 'The Patent

Hair-brushing Mashane.' There were also a banjo solo, a skirt dance

of discretion, and a campanological turn. At last, towards ten

o'clock, Mr. Gordon, who had hitherto done nothing, rose in his

place, amid good-natured cries of 'Gas!'
'I feel sure you will all agree with me,' he began, 'that this

evening would not be complete without a vote of thanks—a very

hearty vote of thanks—to our excellent host and

chairman.'
Ear-splitting applause.
034 'I've got a little story to tell you,' he

continued—'a story that up to this moment has been a close

secret between his Worship the Mayor and myself.' His Worship

looked up sharply at the speaker. 'You've heard about some geese, I

reckon. (Laughter.) Well, you've not heard all, but I'm

going to tell you. I can't keep it to myself any longer. You think

his Worship drove those geese—I hope they're digesting well

(loud laughter)—just for fun. He didn't. I was with

him when he bought them, and I happened to say that goosedriving

was a very difficult accomplishment.'
'Depends on the geese!' shouted a voice.
'Yes, it does,' Mr. Gordon admitted. 'Well, his Worship

contradicted me, and we had a bit of an argument. I don't bet, as

you know—at least, not often—but I don't mind

confessing that I offered to bet him a sovereign he couldn't drive

his geese half a mile. "Look here, Gordon," he said to me: "there's

a lot of distress in the town just now—trade bad, and so on,

and so on. I'll lay you a level ten pounds I drive these geese to

Hillport myself, the loser to give the money to charity." 035 "Done,"

I said. "Don't say anything about it," he says. "I won't," I

says—but I am doing. (Applause.) I feel it my duty to

say something about it. (More applause.) Well, I lost, as

you all know. He drove 'em to Hillport. ('Good old Jos!')

That's not all. The Mayor insisted on putting his own ten pounds to

mine and making it twenty. Here are the two identical notes, his

and mine.' Mr. Gordon waved the identical notes amid an uproar.

'We've decided that everyone who has dined here to-night shall

receive a brand-new shilling. I see Mr. Septimus Lovatt from the

bank there with a bag. He will attend to you as you go out.

(Wild outbreak and tumult of rapturous applause.) And now

three cheers for your Mayor—and Mayoress!'
It was colossal, the enthusiasm.
'And for Gas Gordon!' called several voices.
The cheers rose again in surging waves.
Everyone remarked that the Mayor, usually so imperturbable, was

quite overcome—seemed as if he didn't know where to look.
Afterwards, as the occupants of the platform descended, Mr.

Gordon glanced into the eyes of Mrs. Curtenty, and found there his

exceeding 036 reward. The mediocrity had blossomed out that

evening into something new and strange. Liar, deliberate liar and

self-accused gambler as he was, he felt that he had lived during

that speech; he felt that it was the supreme moment of his

life.
'What a perfectly wonderful man your husband is!' said Mrs.

Duncalf to Mrs. Curtenty.
Clara turned to her husband with a sublime gesture of

satisfaction. In the brougham, going home, she bewitched him with

wifely endearments. She could afford to do so. The stigma of the

geese episode was erased.
But the barmaid of the Tiger, as she let down her bright hair

that night in the attic of the Tiger, said to herself, 'Well, of

all the——' Just that.


039


THE ELIXIR OF YOUTH

It was Monday afternoon of Bursley Wakes—not our modern

rectified festival, but the wild and naïve orgy of seventy

years ago, the days of bear-baiting and of bull-baiting, from which

latter phrase, they say, the town derives its name. In those times

there was a town-bull, a sort of civic beast; and a certain

notorious character kept a bear in his pantry. The 'beating'

(baiting) occurred usually on Sunday mornings at six o'clock, with

formidable hungry dogs; and little boys used to look forward

eagerly to the day when they would be old enough to be permitted to

attend. On Sunday afternoons colliers and potters, gathered round

the jawbone of a whale which then stood as a natural curiosity on

the waste space near the corn-mill, would discuss the fray, and

make bets for next Sunday, while the exhausted dogs 040 licked

their wounds, or died. During the Wakes week bull and bear were

baited at frequent intervals, according to popular demand, for

thousands of sportsmen from neighbouring villages seized the

opportunity of the fair to witness the fine beatings for which

Bursley was famous throughout the country of the Five Towns. In

that week the Wakes took possession of the town, which yielded

itself with savage abandonment to all the frenzies of license. The

public-houses remained continuously open night and day, and the

barmen and barmaids never went to bed; every inn engaged special

'talent' in order to attract custom, and for a hundred hours the

whole thronged town drank, drank, until the supply of coin of

George IV., converging gradually into the coffers of a few persons,

ceased to circulate. Towards the end of the Wakes, by way of a last

ecstasy, the cockfighters would carry their birds, which had

already fought and been called off, perhaps, half a dozen times, to

the town-field (where the discreet 40 per cent. brewery now

stands), and there match them to a finish. It was a spacious

age.
On this Monday afternoon in June the less 041 fervid activities of

the Wakes were proceeding as usual in the market-place,

overshadowed by the Town Hall—not the present stone structure

with its gold angel, but a brick edifice built on an ashlar

basement. Hobby-horses and revolving swing-boats, propelled, with

admirable economy to the proprietors, by privileged boys who took

their pay in an occasional ride, competed successfully with the

skeleton man, the fat or bearded woman, and Aunt Sally. The long

toy-tents, artfully roofed with a tinted cloth which permitted only

a soft, mellow light to illuminate the wares displayed, were

crowded with jostling youth and full of the sound of whistles,

'squarkers,' and various pipes; and multitudes surrounded the

gingerbread, nut, and savoury stalls which lined both sides of the

roadway as far as Duck Bank. In front of the numerous boxing-booths

experts of the 'fancy,' obviously out of condition, offered to

fight all comers, and were not seldom well thrashed by impetuous

champions of local fame. There were no photographic studios and no

cocoanut-shies, for these things had not been thought of; and to us

moderns the fair, despite its uncontrolled exuberance of revelry,

042

would have seemed strangely quiet, since neither steam-organ nor

hooter nor hurdy-gurdy was there to overwhelm the ear with crashing

waves of gigantic sound. But if the special phenomena of a later

day were missing from the carnival, others, as astonishing to us as

the steam-organ would have been to those uncouth roisterers, were

certainly present. Chief, perhaps, among these was the man who

retailed the elixir of youth, the veritable eau de jouvence,

to credulous drinkers at sixpence a bottle. This magician, whose

dark mysterious face and glittering eyes indicated a strain of

Romany blood, and whose accent proved that he had at any rate lived

much in Yorkshire, had a small booth opposite the watch-house under

the Town Hall. On a banner suspended in front of it was painted the

legend:

THE INCA OF PERU'S
ELIXER OF YOUTH SOLD HERE.
ETERNAL YOUTH FOR ALL. DRINK THIS AND YOU

WILL NEVER GROW OLD AS SUPPLIED TO THE NOBILITY

& GENTRY SIXPENCE PER BOT.
WALK IN, WALK IN, & CONSULT THE INCA

OF PERU.

043 The Inca of Peru, dressed in black velveteens,

with a brilliant scarf round his neck, stood at the door of his

tent, holding an empty glass in one jewelled hand, and with the

other twirling a long and silken moustache. Handsome, graceful, and

thoroughly inured to the public gaze, he fronted a small circle of

gapers like an actor adroit to make the best of himself, and his

tongue wagged fast enough to wag a man's leg off. At a casual

glance he might have been taken for thirty, but his age was fifty

and more—if you could catch him in the morning before he had

put the paint on.
'Ladies and gentlemen of Bursley, this enlightened and beautiful

town which I am now visiting for the first time,' he began in a

hard, metallic voice, employing again with the glib accuracy of a

machine the exact phrases which he had been using all day, 'look at

me—look well at me. How old do you think I am? How old do I

seem? Twenty, my dear, do you say?' and he turned with practised

insolence to a pot-girl in a red shawl who could not have uttered

an audible word to save her soul, but who blushed and giggled with

pleasure at this mark of attention. 'Ah! you flatter, 044 fair

maiden! I look more than twenty, but I think I may say that I do

not look thirty. Does any lady or gentleman think I look thirty?

No! As a matter of fact, I was twenty-nine years of age when, in

South America, while exploring the ruins of the most ancient

civilization of the world—of the world, ladies and

gentlemen—I made my wonderful discovery, the Elixir of

Youth!'
'What art blethering at, Licksy?' a drunken man called from the

back of the crowd, and the nickname stuck to the great discoverer

during the rest of the Wakes.
'That, ladies and gentlemen,' the Inca of Peru continued

unperturbed, 'was—seventy-two years ago. I am now a hundred

and one years old precisely, and as fresh as a kitten, all along of

my marvellous elixir. Far older, for instance, than this good dame

here.'
He pointed to an aged and wrinkled woman, in blue cotton and a

white mutch, who was placidly smoking a short cutty. This creature,

bowed and satiate with monotonous years, took the pipe from her

indrawn lips, and asked in a weary, trembling falsetto:
'How many wives hast had?'
045 'Seventane,' the Inca retorted quickly,

dropping at once into broad dialect, 'and now lone and lookin' to

wed again. Wilt have me?'
'Nay,' replied the crone. 'I've buried four mysen, and no man o'

mine shall bury me.'
There was a burst of laughter, amid which the Inca, taking the

crowd archly into his confidence, remarked:
'I've never administered my elixir to any of my wives, ladies

and gentlemen. You may blame me, but I freely confess the fact;'

and he winked.
'Licksy! Licksy!' the drunken man idiotically chanted.
'And now,' the Inca proceeded, coming at length to the practical

part of his ovation, 'see here!' With the rapidity of a conjurer he

whipped from his pocket a small bottle, and held it up before the

increasing audience. It contained a reddish fluid, which shone

bright and rich in the sunlight. 'See here!' he cried

magnificently, but he was destined to interruption.
A sudden cry arose of 'Black Jack! Black Jack! 'Tis him! He's

caught!' And the 046 Inca's crowd, together with all the other

crowds filling the market-place, surged off eastward in a dense,

struggling mass.
The cynosure of every eye was a springless clay-cart, which was

being slowly driven past the newly-erected 'big house' of Enoch

Wood, Esquire, towards the Town Hall. In this, cart were two

constables, with their painted staves drawn, and between the

constables sat a man securely chained—Black Jack of

Moorthorne, the mining village which lies over the ridge a mile or

so east of Bursley. The captive was a ferocious and splendid young

Hercules, tall, with enormous limbs and hands and heavy black

brows. He was dressed in his soiled working attire of a collier,

the trousers strapped under the knees, and his feet shod in vast

clogs. With open throat, small head, great jaws, and bold beady

eyes, he looked what he was, the superb brute—the brute

reckless of all save the instant satisfaction of his desires. He

came of a family of colliers, the most debased class in a lawless

district. Jack's father had been a colliery-serf, legally enslaved

to his colliery, legally liable to be sold with the colliery as a

chattel, 047 and legally bound to bring up all his sons as

colliers, until the Act of George III. put an end to this

incredible survival from the customs of the Dark Ages. Black Jack

was now a hero to the crowd, and knew it, for those vast clogs had

kicked a woman to death on the previous day. She was a Moorthorne

woman, not his wife, but his sweetheart, older than he; people said

that she nagged him, and that he was tired of her. The murderer had

hidden for a night, and then, defiantly, surrendered to the watch,

and the watch were taking him to the watch-house in the ashlar

basement of the Town Hall. The feeble horse between the shafts of

the cart moved with difficulty through the press, and often the

coloured staves of the constables came down thwack on the heads of

heedless youth. At length the cart reached the space between the

watch-house and the tent of the Inca of Peru, where it stopped

while the constables unlocked a massive door; the prisoner remained

proudly in the cart, accepting, with obvious delight, the tribute

of cheers and jeers, hoots and shouts, from five thousand

mouths.
The Inca of Peru stood at the door of his 048 tent and surveyed

Black Jack, who was not more than a few feet away from him.
'Have a glass of my elixir,' he said to the death-dealer; 'no

one in this town needs it more than thee, by all accounts. Have a

glass, and live for ever. Only sixpence.'
The man in the cart laughed aloud.
'I've nowt on me—not a farden,' he answered, in a strong

grating voice.
At that moment a girl, half hidden by the cart, sprang forward,

offering something in her outstretched palm to the Inca; but he,

misunderstanding her intention, merely glanced with passing

interest at her face, and returned his gaze to the prisoner.
'I'll give thee a glass, lad,' he said quickly, 'and then thou

canst defy Jack Ketch.'
The crowd yelled with excitement, and the murderer held forth

his great hand for the potion. Using every art to enhance the

effect of this dramatic advertisement, the Inca of Peru raised his

bottle on high, and said in a loud, impressive tone:
'This precious liquid has the property, possessed by no other

liquid on earth, of frothing twice. I shall pour it into the glass,

049

and it will froth. Black Jack will drink it, and after he has drunk

it will froth again. Observe!'
He uncorked the bottle and filled the glass with the reddish

fluid, which after a few seconds duly effervesced, to the vague

wonder of the populace. The Inca held the glass till the froth had

subsided, and then solemnly gave it to Black Jack.
'Drink!' commanded the Inca.
Black Jack took the draught at a gulp, and instantly flung the

glass at the Inca's face. It missed him, however. There were signs

of a fracas, but the door of the watch-house swung opportunely

open, and Jack was dragged from the cart and hustled within. The

crowd, with a crowd's fickleness, turned to other affairs.
That evening the ingenious Inca of Peru did good trade for

several hours, but towards eleven o'clock the attraction of the

public-houses and of a grand special combined bull and bear beating

by moonlight in the large yard of the Cock Inn drew away the circle

of his customers until there was none left. He retired inside the

tent with several pounds in his pocket and a god's consciousness of

having 050 made immortal many of the sons and daughters

of Adam.
As he was counting out his gains on the tub of eternal youth by

the flicker of a dip, someone lifted the flap of the booth and

stealthily entered. He sprang up, fearing robbery with violence,

which was sufficiently common during the Wakes; but it was only the

young girl who had stood behind the cart when he offered to Black

Jack his priceless boon. The Inca had noticed her with increasing

interest several times during the evening as she loitered restless

near the door of the watch-house.
'What do you want?' he asked her, with the ingratiating

affability of the rake who foresees everything.
'Give me a drink.'
'A drink of what, my dear?'
'Licksy.'
He raised the dip, and by its light examined her face. It was a

kind of face which carries no provocative signal for nine men out

of ten, but which will haunt the tenth: a child's face with a

passionate woman's eyes burning and dying in it—black hair,

black eyes, thin pale 051 cheeks, equine

nostrils, red lips, small ears, and the smallest chin conceivable.

He smiled at her, pleased.
'Can you pay for it?' he said pleasantly.
The girl evidently belonged to the poorest class. Her shaggy,

uncovered head, lean frame, torn gown, and bare feet, all spoke of

hardship and neglect.
'I've a silver groat,' she answered, and closed her small fist

tighter.
'A silver groat!' he exclaimed, rather astonished. 'Where did

you get that from?'
'He give it me for a-fairing yesterday.'
'Who?'
'Him yonder'—she jerked her head back to indicate the

watch-house—'Black Jack.'
'What for?'
'He kissed me,' she said boldly; 'I'm his sweetheart.'
'Eh!' The Inca paused a moment, startled. 'But he killed his

sweetheart yesterday.'
'What! Meg!' the girl exclaimed with deep scorn. 'Her weren't

his true sweetheart. Her druv him to it. Serve her well right! Owd

Meg!'
'How old are you, my dear?'
052 'Don't know. But feyther said last Wakes I was

fourtane. I mun keep young for Jack. He wunna have me if I'm

owd.'
'But he'll be hanged, they say.'
She gave a short, satisfied laugh.
'Not now he's drunk Licksy—hangman won't get him. I heard

a man say Jack 'd get off wi' twenty year for manslaughter, most

like.'
'And you'll wait twenty years for him?'
'Yes,' she said; 'I'll meet him at prison gates. But I mun be

young. Give me a drink o' Licksy.'
He drew the red draught in silence, and after it had effervesced

offered it to her.
''Tis raight?' she questioned, taking the glass.
The Inca nodded, and, lifting the vessel, she opened her eager

lips and became immortal. It was the first time in her life that

she had drunk out of a glass, and it would be the last.
Struck dumb by the trusting joy in those profound eyes, the Inca

took the empty glass from her trembling hand. Frail organism and

prey of love! Passion had surprised her too young. Noon had come

before the flower could open. She went out of the tent.
053 'Wench!' the Inca called after her, 'thy

groat!'
She paid him and stood aimless for a second, and then started to

cross the roadway. Simultaneously there was a rush and a roar from

the Cock yard close by. The raging bull, dragging its ropes, and

followed by a crowd of alarmed pursuers, dashed out. The girl was

plain in the moonlight. Many others were abroad, but the bull

seemed to see nothing but her, and, lowering his huge head, he

charged with shut eyes and flung her over the Inca's booth.
'Thou's gotten thy wish: thou'rt young for ever!' the Inca of

Peru, made a poet for an instant by this disaster, murmured to

himself as he bent with the curious crowd over the corpse.
Black Jack was hanged.
Many years after all this Bursley built itself a new Town Hall

(with a spire, and a gold angel on the top in the act of crowning

the bailiwick with a gold crown), and began to think about getting

up in the world.

MARY WITH THE HIGH HAND

In the front-bedroom of Edward Beechinor's small house in

Trafalgar Road the two primary social forces of action and

reaction—those forces which under a thousand names and

disguises have alternately ruled the world since the invention of

politics—were pitted against each other in a struggle

rendered futile by the equality of the combatants. Edward Beechinor

had his money, his superior age, and the possible advantage of

being a dying man; Mark Beechinor had his youth and his devotion to

an ideal. Near the window, aloof and apart, stood the strange,

silent girl whose aroused individuality was to intervene with such

effectiveness on behalf of one of the antagonists. It was early

dusk on an autumn day.
'Tell me what it is you want, Edward,' said Mark quietly. 'Let

us come to the point.'
058 'Ay,' said the sufferer, lifting his pale hand

from the counterpane, 'I'll tell thee.'
He moistened his lips as if in preparation, and pushed back a

tuft of sparse gray hair, damp with sweat.
The physical and moral contrast between these two brothers was

complete. Edward was forty-nine, a small, thin, stunted man, with a

look of narrow cunning, of petty shrewdness working without

imagination. He had been clerk to Lawyer Ford for thirty-five

years, and had also furtively practised for himself. During this

period his mode of life had never varied, save once, and that only

a year ago. At the age of fourteen he sat in a grimy room with an

old man on one side of him, a copying-press on the other, and a

law-stationer's almanac in front, and he earned half a crown a

week. At the age of forty-eight he still sat in the same grimy room

(of which the ceiling had meanwhile been whitened three times),

with the same copying-press and the almanac of the same

law-stationers, and he earned thirty shillings a week. But now he,

Edward Beechinor, was the old man, and the indispensable lad of

fourteen, who had once been 059 himself, was another

lad, perhaps thirtieth of the dynasty of office-boys. Throughout

this interminable and sterile desert of time he had drawn the same

deeds, issued the same writs, written the same letters, kept the

same accounts, lied the same lies, and thought the same thoughts.

He had learnt nothing except craft, and forgotten nothing except

happiness. He had never married, never loved, never been a rake,

nor deviated from respectability. He was a success because he had

conceived an object, and by sheer persistence attained it. In the

eyes of Bursley people he was a very decent fellow, a steady

fellow, a confirmed bachelor, a close un, a knowing customer, a

curmudgeon, an excellent clerk, a narrow-minded ass, a good

Wesleyan, a thrifty individual, and an intelligent

burgess—according to the point of view. The lifelong

operation of rigorous habit had sunk him into a groove as deep as

the canon of some American river. His ideas on every subject were

eternally and immutably fixed, and, without being altogether aware

of it, he was part of the solid foundation of England's greatness.

In 1892, when the whole of the Five Towns was agitated by the great

probate case of 060 Wilbraham v. Wilbraham, in which Mr.

Ford acted for the defendants, Beechinor, then aged forty-eight,

was torn from his stool and sent out to Rio de Janeiro as part of a

commission to take the evidence of an important witness who had

declined all offers to come home.
The old clerk was full of pride and self-importance at being

thus selected, but secretly he shrank from the journey, the mere

idea of which filled him with vague apprehension and alarm. His

nature had lost all its adaptability; he trembled like a young girl

at the prospect of new experiences. On the return voyage the vessel

was quarantined at Liverpool for a fortnight, and Beechinor had an

attack of low fever. Eight months afterwards he was ill again.

Beechinor went to bed for the last time, cursing Providence,

Wilbraham v. Wilbraham, and Rio.
Mark Beechinor was thirty, just nineteen years younger than his

brother. Tall, uncouth, big-boned, he had a rather ferocious and

forbidding aspect; yet all women seemed to like him, despite the

fact that he seldom could open his mouth to them. There must have

been 061 something in his wild and liquid dark eyes

which mutely appealed for their protective sympathy, something

about him of shy and wistful romance that atoned for the huge

awkwardness of this taciturn elephant. Mark was at present the

manager of a small china manufactory at Longshaw, the farthest of

the Five Towns in Staffordshire, and five miles from Bursley. He

was an exceptionally clever potter, but he never made money. He had

the dreamy temperament of the inventor. He was a man of ideas, the

kind of man who is capable of forgetting that he has not had his

dinner, and who can live apparently content amid the grossest

domestic neglect. He had once spoilt a hundred and fifty pounds'

worth of ware by firing it in a new kiln of his own contrivance; it

cost him three years of atrocious parsimony to pay for the ware and

the building of the kiln. He was impulsively and recklessly

charitable, and his Saturday afternoons and Sundays were chiefly

devoted to the passionate propagandism of the theories of liberty,

equality, and fraternity.
'Is it true as thou'rt for marrying Sammy Mellor's daughter over

at Hanbridge?' Edward 062 Beechinor asked, in

the feeble, tremulous voice of one agonized by continual pain.
Among relatives and acquaintances he commonly spoke the Five

Towns dialect, reserving the other English for official use.
Mark stood at the foot of the bed, leaning with his elbows on

the brass rail. Like most men, he always felt extremely nervous and

foolish in a sick-room, and the delicacy of this question, so

bluntly put, added to his embarrassment. He looked round timidly in

the direction of the girl at the window; her back was towards

him.
'It's possible,' he replied. 'I haven't asked her yet.'
'Her'll have no money?'
'No.'
'Thou'lt want some brass to set up with. Look thee here, Mark: I

made my will seven years ago i' thy favour.'
'Thank ye,' said Mark gratefully.
'But that,' the dying man continued with a frown—'that was

afore thou'dst taken up with these socialistic doctrines o' thine.

I've heard as thou'rt going to be th' secretary o' the Hanbridge

Labour Church, as they call it.'
063 Hanbridge is the metropolis of the Five Towns,

and its Labour Church is the most audacious and influential of all

the local activities, half secret, but relentlessly determined,

whose aim is to establish the new democratic heaven and the new

democratic earth by means of a gradual and bloodless revolution.

Edward Beechinor uttered its abhorred name with a bitter and

scornful hatred characteristic of the Toryism of a man who, having

climbed high up out of the crowd, fiercely resents any widening or

smoothing of the difficult path which he himself has conquered.
'They've asked me to take the post,' Mark answered.
'What's the wages?' the older man asked, with exasperated

sarcasm.
'Nothing.'
'Mark, lad,' the other said, softening, 'I'm worth seven hundred

pounds and this freehold house. What dost think o' that?'
Even in that moment, with the world and its riches slipping away

from his dying grasp, the contemplation of this great achievement

of thrift filled Edward Beechinor with a sublime 
064 satisfaction.

That sum of seven hundred pounds, which many men would dissipate in

a single night, and forget the next morning that they had done so,

seemed vast and almost incredible to him.
'I know you've always been very careful,' said Mark

politely.
'Give up this old Labour Church'—again old Beechinor laid

a withering emphasis on the phrase—'give up this Labour

Church, and its all thine—house and all.'
Mark shook his head.
'Think twice,' the sick man ordered angrily. 'I tell thee

thou'rt standing to lose every shilling.'
'I must manage without it, then.'
A silence fell.
Each brother was absolutely immovable in his decision, and the

other knew it. Edward might have said: 'I am a dying man: give up

this thing to oblige me.' And Mark could have pleaded: 'At such a

moment I would do anything to oblige you—except this, and

this I really can't do. Forgive me.' Such amenities would possibly

have eased the cord which was about to snap; but the idea of

regarding 065 Edward's condition as a factor in the case did

not suggest itself favourably to the grim Beechinor stock, so

stern, harsh, and rude. The sick man wiped from his sunken features

the sweat which continually gathered there. Then he turned upon his

side with a grunt.
'Thou must fetch th' lawyer,' he said at length, 'for I'll cut

thee off.'
It was a strange request—like ordering a condemned man to

go out and search for his executioner; but Mark answered with

perfect naturalness:
'Yes. Mr. Ford, I suppose?'
'Ford? No! Dost think I want him meddling i' my affairs?

Go to young Baines up th' road. Tell him to come at once. He's sure

to be at home, as it's Saturday night.'
'Very well.'
Mark turned to leave the room.
'And, young un, I've done with thee. Never pass my door again

till thou know'st I'm i' my coffin. Understand?'
Mark hesitated a moment, and then went out, quietly closing the

door. No sooner had he done so than the girl, hitherto so passive

at the window, flew after him.
066 There are some women whose calm, enigmatic

faces seem always to suggest the infinite. It is given to few to

know them, so rare as they are, and their lives usually so

withdrawn; but sometimes they pass in the street, or sit like

sphinxes in the church or the theatre, and then the memory of their

features, persistently recurring, troubles us for days. They are

peculiar to no class, these women: you may find them in a print

gown or in diamonds. Often they have thin, rather long lips and

deep rounded chins; but it is the fine upward curve of the nostrils

and the fall of the eyelids which most surely mark them. Their

glances and their faint smiles are beneficent, yet with a subtle

shade of half-malicious superiority. When they look at you from

under those apparently fatigued eyelids, you feel that they have an

inward and concealed existence far beyond the ordinary—that

they are aware of many things which you can never know. It is as

though their souls, during former incarnations, had trafficked with

the secret forces of nature, and so acquired a mysterious and

nameless quality above all the transient attributes of beauty, wit,

and talent. They exist: that is 067 enough; that is

their genius. Whether they control, or are at the mercy of, those

secret forces; whether they have in fact learnt, but may not speak,

the true answer to the eternal Why; whether they are not perhaps a

riddle even to their own simple selves: these are points which can

never be decided.
Everyone who knew Mary Beechinor, in her cousin's home, or at

chapel, or on Titus Price's earthenware manufactory, where she

worked, said or thought that 'there was something about her ...'

and left the phrase unachieved. She was twenty-five, and she had

lived under the same roof with Edward Beechinor for seven years,

since the sudden death of her parents. The arrangement then made

was that Edward should keep her, while she conducted his household.

She had insisted on permission to follow her own occupation, and in

order that she might be at liberty to do so she personally paid

eighteenpence a week to a little girl who came in to perform sundry

necessary duties every day at noon. Mary Beechinor was a paintress

by trade. As a class the paintresses of the Five Towns are somewhat

similar to the more famous mill-girls of Lancashire and

Yorkshire—fiercely 068 independent by

reason of good wages earned, loving finery and brilliant colours,

loud-tongued and aggressive, perhaps, and for the rest neither more

nor less kindly, passionate, faithful, than any other Saxon women

anywhere. The paintresses, however, have some slight advantage over

the mill-girls in the outward reticences of demeanour, due no doubt

to the fact that their ancient craft demands a higher skill, and is

pursued under more humane and tranquil conditions. Mary Beechinor

worked in the 'band-and-line' department of the painting-shop at

Price's. You may have observed the geometrical exactitude of the

broad and thin coloured lines round the edges of a common cup and

saucer, and speculated upon the means by which it was arrived at. A

girl drew those lines, a girl with a hand as sure as Giotto's, and

no better tools than a couple of brushes and a small revolving

table called a whirler. Forty-eight hours a week Mary Beechinor sat

before her whirler. Actuating the treadle, she placed a piece of

ware on the flying disc, and with a single unerring flip of the

finger pushed it precisely to the centre; then she held the full

brush firmly against the ware, and in three 069 seconds the band

encircled it truly; another brush taken up, and the line below the

band also stood complete. And this process was repeated, with

miraculous swiftness, hour after hour, week after week, year after

year. Mary could decorate over thirty dozen cups and saucers in a

day, at three halfpence the dozen. 'Doesn't she ever do anything

else?' some visitor might curiously inquire, whom Titus Price was

showing over his ramshackle manufactory. 'No, always the same

thing,' Titus would answer, made proud for the moment of this

phenomenon of stupendous monotony. 'I wonder how she can stand

it—she has a refined face,' the visitor might remark; and

Mary Beechinor was left alone again. The idea that her work was

monotonous probably never occurred to the girl. It was her

work—as natural as sleep, or the knitting which she always

did in the dinner-hour. The calm and silent regularity of it had

become part of her, deepening her original quiescence, and setting

its seal upon her inmost spirit. She was not in the fellowship of

the other girls in the painting-shop. She seldom joined their more

boisterous diversions, nor talked their talk, and she never

070

manoeuvred for their men. But they liked her, and their attitude

showed a certain respect, forced from them by they knew not what.

The powers in the office spoke of Mary Beechinor as 'a very

superior girl.'
She ran downstairs after Mark, and he waited in the narrow hall,

where there was scarcely room for two people to pass. Mark looked

at her inquiringly. Rather thin, and by no means tall, she seemed

the merest morsel by his side. She was wearing her second-best

crimson merino frock, partly to receive the doctor and partly

because it was Saturday night; over this a plain bibless apron. Her

cold gray eyes faintly sparkled in anger above the cheeks white

with watching, and the dropped corners of her mouth showed a

contemptuous indignation. Mary Beechinor was ominously roused from

the accustomed calm of years. Yet Mark at first had no suspicion

that she was disturbed. To him that pale and inviolate face, even

while it cast a spell over him, gave no sign of the fires

within.
She took him by the coat-sleeve and silently directed him into

the gloomy little parlour crowded with mahogany and horsehair

furniture, 071 white antimacassars, wax flowers under glass,

and ponderous gilt-clasped Bibles.
'It's a cruel shame!' she whispered, as though afraid of being

overheard by the dying man upstairs.
'Do you think I ought to have given way?' he questioned,

reddening.
'You mistake me,' she said quickly; and with a sudden movement

she went up to him and put her hand on his shoulder. The caress, so

innocent, unpremeditated, and instinctive, ran through him like a

voltaic shock. These two were almost strangers; they had scarcely

met till within the past week, Mark being seldom in Bursley. 'You

mistake me—it is a shame of him! I'm fearfully

angry.'
'Angry?' he repeated, astonished.
'Yes, angry.' She walked to the window, and, twitching at the

blind-cord, gazed into the dim street. It was beginning to grow

dark. 'Shall you fetch the lawyer? I shouldn't if I were you. I

won't.'
'I must fetch him,' Mark said.
She turned round and admired him. 'What will he do with

his precious money?' she murmured.
072 'Leave it to you, probably.'
'Not he. I wouldn't touch it—not now; it's yours by

rights. Perhaps you don't know that when I came here it was

distinctly understood I wasn't to expect anything under his will.

Besides, I have my own money ... Oh dear! If he wasn't in such

pain, wouldn't I talk to him—for the first and last time in

my life!'
'You must please not say a word to him. I don't really want the

money.'
'But you ought to have it. If he takes it away from you he's

unjust.'
'What did the doctor say this afternoon?' asked Mark, wishing to

change the subject.
'He said the crisis would come on Monday, and when it did Edward

would be dead all in a minute. He said it would be just like taking

prussic acid.'
'Not earlier than Monday?'
'He said he thought Monday.'
'Of course I shall take no notice of what Edward said to

me—I shall call to-morrow morning—and stay. Perhaps he

won't mind seeing me. And then you can tell me what happens

to-night.'
073 'I'm sure I shall send that lawyer man about

his business,' she threatened.
'Look here,' said Mark timorously as he was leaving the house,

'I've told you I don't want the money—I would give it away to

some charity; but do you think I ought to pretend to yield, just to

humour him, and let him die quiet and peaceful? I shouldn't like

him to die hating——'
'Never—never!' she exclaimed.

'What have you and Mark been talking about?' asked Edward

Beechinor apprehensively as Mary re-entered the bedroom.
'Nothing,' she replied with a grave and soothing kindliness of

tone.
'Because, miss, if you think——'
'You must have your medicine now, Edward.'
But before giving the patient his medicine she peeped through

the curtain and watched Mark's figure till it disappeared up the

hill towards Bleakridge. He, on his part, walked with her image

always in front of him. He thought hers was the strongest, most

righteous soul he had ever encountered; it seemed as if she had a

perfect passion for truth and justice. 074 And a week ago he

had deemed her a capable girl, certainly—but

lackadaisical!

The clock had struck ten before Mr. Baines, the solicitor,

knocked at the door. Mary hesitated, and then took him upstairs in

silence while he suavely explained to her why he had been unable to

come earlier. This lawyer was a young Scotsman who had descended

upon the town from nowhere, bought a small decayed practice, and

within two years had transformed it into a large and flourishing

business by one of those feats of energy, audacity, and tact,

combined, of which some Scotsmen seem to possess the secret.
'Here is Mr. Baines, Edward,' Mary said quietly; and then,

having rearranged the sick man's pillow, she vanished out of the

room and went into the kitchen.
The gas-jet there showed only a point of blue, but she did not

turn it up. Dragging an old oak rush-seated rocking-chair near to

the range, where a scrap of fire still glowed, she rocked herself

gently in the darkness.
After about half an hour Mr. Baines's voice sounded at the head

of the stairs:
075 'Miss Beechinor, will ye kindly step up? We

shall want some asseestance.'
She obeyed, but not instantly.
In the bedroom Mr. Baines, a fountain-pen between his fine white

teeth, was putting some coal on the fire. He stood up as she

entered.
'Mr. Beechinor is about to make a new will,' he said, without

removing the pen from his mouth, 'and ye will kindly witness

it.'
The small room appeared to be full of Baines—he was so

large and fleshy and assertive. The furniture, even the chest of

drawers, was dwarfed into toy-furniture, and Beechinor, slight and

shrunken-up, seemed like a cadaverous manikin in the bed.
'Now, Mr. Beechinor.' Dusting his hands, the lawyer took a

newly-written document from the dressing-table, and, spreading it

on the lid of a cardboard box, held it before the dying man.

'Here's the pen. There! I'll help ye to hold it.'
Beechinor clutched the pen. His wrinkled and yellow face,

flushed in irregular patches as though the cheeks had been badly

rouged, was covered with perspiration, and each difficult movement,

even to the slightest lifting of the 076 head, showed extreme

exhaustion. He cast at Mary a long sinister glance of mistrust and

apprehension.
'What is there in this will?'
Mr. Baines looked sharply up at the girl, who now stood at the

side of the bed opposite him. Mechanically she smoothed the tumbled

bed-clothes.
'That's nowt to do wi' thee, lass,' said Beechinor

resentfully.
'It isn't necessary that a witness to a will should be aware of

its contents,' said Baines. 'In fact, it's quite unusual.'
'I sign nothing in the dark,' she said, smiling. Through their

half-closed lids her eyes glimmered at Baines.
'Ha! Legal caution acquired from your cousin, I presume.' Baines

smiled at her. 'But let me assure ye, Miss Beechinor, this is a

mere matter of form. A will must be signed in the presence of two

witnesses, both present at the same time; and there's only yeself

and me for it.'
Mary looked at the dying man, whose features were writhed in

pain, and shook her head.
077 'Tell her,' he murmured with bitter despair,

and sank down into the pillows, dropping the fountain-pen, which

had left a stain of ink on the sheet before Baines could pick it

up.
'Well, then, Miss Beechinor, if ye must know,' Baines began with

sarcasm, 'the will is as follows: The testator—that's Mr.

Beechinor—leaves twenty guineas to his brother Mark to show

that he bears him no ill-will and forgives him. The rest of his

estate is to be realized, and the proceeds given to the North

Staffordshire Infirmary, to found a bed, which is to be called the

Beechinor bed. If there is any surplus, it is to go to the Law

Clerks' Provident Society. That is all.'
'I shall have nothing to do with it,' Mary said coldly.
'Young lady, we don't want ye to have anything to do with it. We

only desire ye to witness the signature.'
'I won't witness the signature, and I won't see it signed.'
'Damn thee, Mary! thou'rt a wicked wench,' Beechinor whispered

in hoarse, feeble tones. 078 He saw himself

robbed of the legitimate fruit of all those interminable years of

toilsome thrift. This girl by a trick would prevent him from

disposing of his own. He, Edward Beechinor, shrewd and wealthy, was

being treated like a child. He was too weak to rave, but from his

aggrieved and furious heart he piled silent curses on her. 'Go,

fetch another witness,' he added to the lawyer.
'Wait a moment,' said Baines. 'Miss Beechinor, do ye mean to say

that ye will cross the solemn wish of a dying man?'
'I mean to say I won't help a dying man to commit a crime.'
'A crime?'
'Yes,' she answered, 'a crime. Seven years ago Mr. Beechinor

willed everything to his brother Mark, and Mark ought to have

everything. Mark is his only brother—his only relation except

me. And Edward knows it isn't me wants any of his money. North

Staffordshire Infirmary indeed! It's a crime!... What business have

you,' she went on to Edward Beechinor, 'to punish Mark just

because his politics aren't——'
'That's beside the point,' the lawyer interrupted. 079 'A

testator has a perfect right to leave his property as he chooses,

without giving reasons. Now, Miss Beechinor, I must ask ye to be

judeecious.'
Mary shut her lips.
'Her'll never do it. I tell thee, fetch another witness.'
The old man sprang up in a sort of frenzy as he uttered the

words, and then fell back in a brief swoon.
Mary wiped his brow, and pushed away the wet and matted hair.

Presently he opened his eyes, moaning. Mr. Baines folded up the

will, put it in his pocket, and left the room with quick steps.

Mary heard him open the front-door and then return to the foot of

the stairs.
'Miss Beechinor,' he called, 'I'll speak with ye a moment.'
She went down.
'Do you mind coming into the kitchen?' she said, preceding him

and turning up the gas; 'there's no light in the front-room.'
He leaned up against the high mantelpiece; his frock-coat hung

to the level of the oven-knob. She had one hand on the white deal

080

table. Between them a tortoiseshell cat purred on the red-tiled

floor.
'Ye're doing a verra serious thing, Miss Beechinor. As Mr.

Beechinor's solicitor, I should just like to be acquaint with the

real reasons for this conduct.'
'I've told you.' She had a slightly quizzical look.
'Now, as to Mark,' the lawyer continued blandly, 'Mr. Beechinor

explained the whole circumstances to me. Mark as good as defied his

brother.'
'That's nothing to do with it.'
'By the way, it appears that Mark is practically engaged to be

married. May I ask if the lady is yeself?'
She hesitated.
'If so,' he proceeded, 'I may tell ye informally that I admire

the pluck of ye. But, nevertheless, that will has got to be

executed.'
'The young lady is a Miss Mellor of Hanbridge.'
'I'm going to fetch my clerk,' he said shortly. 'I can see ye're

an obstinate and unfathomable woman. I'll be back in half an

hour.'
081 When he had departed she bolted the front-door

top and bottom, and went upstairs to the dying man.
Nearly an hour elapsed before she heard a knock. Mr. Baines had

had to arouse his clerk from sleep. Instead of going down to the

front-door, Mary threw up the bedroom window and looked out. It was

a mild but starless night. Trafalgar Road was silent save for the

steam-car, which, with its load of revellers returning from

Hanbridge—that centre of gaiety—slipped rumbling down

the hill towards Bursley.
'What do you want—disturbing a respectable house at this

time of night?' she called in a loud whisper when the car had

passed. 'The door's bolted, and I can't come down. You must come in

the morning.'
'Miss Beechinor, ye will let us in—I charge ye.'
'It's useless, Mr. Baines.'
'I'll break the door down. I'm a strong man, and a determined.

Ye are carrying things too far.'
In another moment the two men heard the creak of the bolts. Mary

stood before 082 them, vaguely discernible, but a forbidding

figure.
'If you must—come upstairs,' she said coldly.
'Stay here in the passage, Arthur,' said Mr. Baines; 'I'll call

ye when I want ye;' and he followed Mary up the stairs.
Edward Beechinor lay on his back, and his sunken eyes stared

glassily at the ceiling. The skin of his emaciated face, stretched

tightly over the protruding bones, had lost all its crimson, and

was green, white, yellow. The mouth was wide open. His drawn

features wore a terribly sardonic look—a purely physical

effect of the disease; but it seemed to the two spectators that

this mean and disappointed slave of a miserly habit had by one

superb imaginative effort realized the full vanity of all human

wishes and pretensions.
'Ye can go; I shan't want ye,' said Mr. Baines, returning to the

clerk.
The lawyer never spoke of that night's business. Why should he?

To what end? Mark Beechinor, under the old will, inherited the

seven hundred pounds and the house. Miss Mellor of Hanbridge is

still Miss Mellor, her 083 hand not having been

formally sought. But Mark, secretary of the Labour Church, is

married. Miss Mellor, with a quite pardonable air of tolerant

superiority, refers to his wife as 'a strange, timid little

creature—she couldn't say Bo to a goose.'

THE DOG

This is a scandalous story. It scandalized the best people in

Bursley; some of them would wish it forgotten. But since I have

begun to tell it I may as well finish. Moreover, like most tales

whispered behind fans and across club-tables, it carries a high and

valuable moral. The moral—I will let you have it at

once—is that those who love in glass houses should pull down

the blinds.
I
He had got his collar on safely; it bore his name—Ellis

Carter. Strange name for a dog, perhaps; and perhaps it was even

more strange that his collar should be white. But such dogs are not

common dogs. He tied his necktie exquisitely; caressed his hair

again with two brushes; curved his young moustache, 088 and

then assumed his waistcoat and his coat; the trousers had naturally

preceded the collar. He beheld the suit in the glass, and saw that

it was good. And it was not built in London, either. There are

tailors in Bursley. And in particular there is the dog's tailor.

Ask the dog's tailor, as the dog once did, whether he can really do

as well as London, and he will smile on you with gentle pity; he

will not stoop to utter the obvious Yes. He may casually inform you

that, if he is not in London himself, the explanation is that he

has reasons for preferring Bursley. He is the social equal of all

his clients. He belongs to the dogs' club. He knows, and everybody

knows, that he is a first-class tailor with a first-class

connection, and no dog would dare to condescend to him. He is a

great creative artist; the dogs who wear his clothes may be said to

interpret his creations. Now, Ellis was a great interpretative

artist, and the tailor recognised the fact. When the tailor met

Ellis on Duck Bank greatly wearing a new suit, the scene was

impressive. It was as though Elgar had stopped to hear Paderewski

play 'Pomp and Circumstance' on the piano.
089 Ellis descended from his bedroom into the

hall, took his straw hat, chose a stick, and went out into the

portico of the new large house on the Hawkins, near Oldcastle. In

the neighbourhood of the Five Towns no road is more august, more

correct, more detached, more umbrageous, than the Hawkins. M.P.'s

live there. It is the link between the aristocratic and antique

aloofness of Oldcastle and the solid commercial prosperity of the

Five Towns. Ellis adorned the portico. Young (a bare twenty-two),

fair, handsome, smiling, graceful, well-built, perfectly groomed,

he was an admirable and a characteristic specimen of the race of

dogs which, with the modern growth of luxury and the Luxurious

Spirit, has become so marked a phenomenon in the social development

of the once barbarous Five Towns.
When old Jack Carter (reputed to be the best turner that Bursley

ever produced) started a little potbank near St. Peter's Church in

1861—he was then forty, and had saved two hundred

pounds—he little dreamt that the supreme and final result

after forty years would be the dog. But so it was. Old Jack

090

Carter had a son John Carter, who married at twenty-five and lived

at first on twenty-five shillings a week, and enthusiastically

continued the erection of the fortune which old Jack had begun. At

thirty-three, after old Jack's death, John became a Town

Councillor. At thirty-six he became Mayor and the father of Ellis,

and the recipient of a silver cradle. Ellis was his wife's maiden

name. At forty-two he built the finest earthenware manufactory in

Bursley, down by the canal-side at Shawport. At fifty-two he had

been everything that a man can be in the Five Towns—from

County Councillor to President of the Society for the Prosecution

of Felons. Then Ellis left school and came to the works to carry on

the tradition, and his father suddenly discovered him. The truth

was that John Carter had been so laudably busy with the affairs of

his town and county that he had nearly forgotten his family. Ellis,

in the process of achieving doghood, soon taught his father a thing

or two. And John learnt. John could manage a public meeting, but he

could not manage Ellis. Besides, there was plenty of money; and

Ellis was so ingratiating, 091 and had curly hair

that somehow won sympathy. And, after all, Ellis was not such a

duffer as all that at the works. John knew other people's sons who

were worse. And Ellis could keep order in the paintresses' 'shops'

as order had never been kept there before.
John sometimes wondered what old Jack would have said about

Ellis and his friends, those handsome dogs, those fine dandies, who

taught to the Five Towns the virtue of grace and of style and of

dash, who went up to London—some of them even went to Paris

—and brought back civilization to the Five Towns, who removed

from the Five Towns the reproach of being uncouth and behind the

times. Was the outcome of two generations of unremitting toil

merely Ellis? (Ellis had several pretty sisters, but they did not

count.) John could only guess at what old Jack's attitude might

have been towards Ellis—Ellis, who had his shirts made to

measure. He knew exactly what was Ellis's attitude towards the

ideals of old Jack, old Jack the class-leader, who wore clogs till

he was thirty, and dined in his shirt-sleeves at one o'clock to the

end of his life.
092 Ellis quitted the portico, ran down the

winding garden-path, and jumped neatly and fearlessly on to an

electric tramcar as it passed at the rate of fifteen miles an hour.

The car was going to Hanbridge, and it was crowded with the joy of

life; Ellis had to stand on the step. This was the Saturday before

the first Monday in August, and therefore the formal opening of

Knype Wakes, the most carnivalesque of all the carnivals which

enliven the four seasons in the Five Towns. It is still called

Knype Wakes, because once Knype overshadowed Hanbridge in

importance; but its headquarters are now quite properly at

Hanbridge, the hub, the centre, the Paris of the Five

Towns—Hanbridge, the county borough of sixty odd thousand

inhabitants. It is the festival of the masses that old Jack sprang

from, and every genteel person who can leaves the Five Towns for

the seaside at the end of July. Nevertheless, the district is never

more crammed than at Knype Wakes. And, of course, genteel persons,

whom circumstances have forced to remain in the Five Towns, sally

out in the evening to 'do' the Wakes in a spirit of tolerant

condescension. 093 Ellis was in this case. His parents and

sisters were at Llandudno, and he had been left in charge of the

works and of the new house. He was always free; he could always

pity the bondage of his sisters; but now he was more free than

ever—he was absolutely free. Imagine the delicious feeling

that surged in his heart as he prepared to plunge himself doggishly

into the wild ocean of the Wakes. By the way, in that heart was the

image of a girl.
II
He stepped off the car on the outskirts of Hanbridge, and

strolled gently and spectacularly into the joyous town. The streets

became more and more crowded and noisy as he approached the

market-place, and in Crown Square tramcars from the four quarters

of the earth discharged tramloads of humanity at the rate of two a

minute, and then glided off again empty in search of more humanity.

The lower portion of Crown Square was devoted to tramlines; in the

upper portion the Wakes began, and spread into the market-place,

and thence by many tentacles into all manner of streets.
094 No Wakes is better than Knype Wakes; that is

to say, no Wakes is more ear-splitting, more terrific, more

dizzying, or more impassable. When you go to Knype Wakes you get

stuck in the midst of an enormous crowd, and you see roundabouts,

swings, switchbacks, myrioramas, atrocity booths, quack dentists,

shooting-galleries, cocoanut-shies, and bazaars, all around you.

Every establishment is jewelled, gilded, and electrically lighted;

every establishment has an orchestra, most often played by steam

and conducted by a stoker; every establishment has a

steam—whistle, which shrieks at the beginning and at the end

of each round or performance. You stand fixed in the multitude

listening to a thousand orchestras and whistles, with the roar of

machinery and the merry din of car-bells, and the popping of rifles

for a background of noise. Your eyes are charmed by the whirling of

a million lights and the mad whirling of millions of beautiful

girls and happy youths under the lights. For the roundabouts rule

the scene; the roundabouts take the money. The supreme desire of

the revellers is to describe circles, either on horseback or in

yachts, either simple circles or complex 095 circles, either up

and down or straight along, but always circles. And it is as though

inventors had sat up at nights puzzling their brains how best to

make revellers seasick while keeping them equidistant from a

steam-orchestra.... Then the crowd solidly lurches, and you find

yourself up against a dentist, or a firm of wrestlers, or a

roundabout, or an ice-cream refectory, and you take what comes. You

have begun to 'do' the Wakes. The splendid insanity seizes you. The

lights, the colours, the explosions, the shrieks, the feathered

hats, the pretty faces as they fly past, the gilding, the statuary,

the August night, and the mingling of a thousand melodies in a

counterpoint beyond the dreams of Wagner—these things have

stirred the sap of life in you, have shown you how fine it is to be

alive, and, careless and free, have caught up your spirit into a

heaven from which you scornfully survey the year of daily toil

between one Wakes and another as the eagle scornfully surveys the

potato-field. Your nostrils dilate—nay, matters reach such a

pass that, even if you are genteel, you forget to condescend.

096


III
After Ellis had had the correct drink in the private bar up the

passage at the Turk's Head, and after he had plunged into the crowd

and got lost in it, and submitted good-humouredly to the frequent

ordeal of the penny squirt as administered by adorable creatures in

bright skirts, he found himself cast up by the human ocean on the

macadam shore near a shooting-gallery. This was no ordinary

shooting-gallery. It was one of Jenkins's affairs (Jenkins of

Manchester), and on either side of it Jenkins's Venetian gondalas

and Jenkins's Mexican mustangs were whizzing round two of Jenkins's

orchestras at twopence a time, and taking thirty-two pounds an

hour. This gallery was very different from the old galleries, in

which you leaned against a brass bar and shot up a kind of a drain.

This gallery was a large and brilliant room, with the front-wall

taken out. It was hung with mirrors and cretonnes, it was richly

carpeted, and, of course, it was lighted by electricity. Carved and

gilded tables bore a whole armoury of weapons. You shot at

tobacco-pipes, twisting 097 and stationary, at

balls poised on jets of water, and at proper targets. In the

corners of the saloon, near the open, were large crimson plush

lounges, on which you lounged after the fatigue of shooting.
A pink-clad girl, young and radiant, had the concern in

charge.
She was speeding a party of bankrupt shooters, when she caught

sight of Ellis. Ellis answered her smile, and strolled up to the

booth with a countenance that might have meant anything. You can

never tell what a dog is thinking.
''Ello!' said the girl prettily (or, rather, she shouted

prettily, having to compete with the two orchestras). 'You here

again?'
The truth was that Ellis had been there on the previous night,

when the Wakes was only half opened, and he had come again to-night

expressly in order to see her; but he would not have admitted, even

to himself, that he had come expressly in order to see her; in his

mind it was just a chance that he might see her. She was a jolly

girl. (We are gradually approaching the scandalous part.)
'What a jolly frock!' he said, when he had 098 shot five celluloid

balls in succession off a jet of water.
Smiling, she mechanically took a ball out of the basket and let

it roll down the conduit to the fountain.
'Do you think so?' she replied, smoothing the fluffy muslin

apron with her small hands, black from contact with the guns. 'That

one I wore last night was my second-best. I only wear this on

Saturdays and Mondays.'
He nodded like a connoisseur. The sixth ball had sprung up to

the top of the jet. He removed it with the certainty of a King's

Prize winner, and she complimented him.
'Ah!' he said, 'you should have seen me before I took to smoking

and drinking!'
She laughed freely. She was always showing her fine teeth. And

she had such a frank, jolly countenance, not exactly

pretty—better than pretty. She was a little short and a

little plump, and she wore a necklace round her neck, a ring on her

dainty, dirty finger, and a watch-bracelet on her wrist.
'Why!' she exclaimed. 'How old are you?'
'How old are you?' he retorted.
099 Dogs do not give things away like that.
'I'm nineteen,' she said submissively. 'At least, I shall be

come Martinmas.'
And she yawned.
'Well,' he said, 'a little girl like you ought to be in

bed.'
'Sunday to-morrow,' she observed.
'Aren't you glad you're English?' he remarked. 'If you were in

Paris you'd have to work Sundays too.'
'Not me!' she said. 'Who told you that? Have you been to

Paris?'
'No,' he admitted cautiously; 'but a friend of mine has, and he

told me. He came back only last week, and he says they keep open

Sundays, and all night sometimes. Sunday is the great day over

there.'
'Well,' said the girl kindly, 'don't you believe it. The police

wouldn't allow it. I know what the police are.'
More shooters entered the saloon. Ellis had finished his dozen;

he sank into a lounge, and elegantly lighted a cigarette, and

watched her serve the other marksmen. She was decidedly charming,

and so jolly—with him. He noticed with satisfaction that with

the 100 other marksmen she showed a certain high

reserve.
They did not stay long, and when they were gone she came across

to the lounge and gazed at him provocatively.
'Dashed if she hasn't taken a fancy to me!'
The thought ran through him like lightning.
'Well?' she said.
'What do you do with yourself Sundays?' he asked her.
'Oh, sleep.'
'All day?'
'All morning.'
'What do you do in the afternoon?'
'Oh, nothing.'
She laughed gaily.
'Come out with me, eh?'
'To-morrow? Oh, I should LOVE TO!' she cried.
Her voice expanded into large capitals because by a singular

chance both the neighbouring orchestras stopped momentarily

together, and thus gave her shout a fair field. The effect was

startling. It startled Ellis. He had not for an instant expected

that she would consent. Never, dog though he was, had he armed

101

a girl out on any afternoon, to say nothing of Sunday afternoon,

and Knype's Wakes Sunday at that! He had talked about girls at the

club. He understood the theory. But the practice——
The foundation of England's greatness is that Englishmen hate to

look fools. The fear of being taken for a ninny will spur an

Englishman to the most surprising deeds of courage. Ellis said

'Good!' with apparent enthusiasm, and arranged to be waiting for

her at half-past two at the Turk's Head. Then he left the saloon

and struck out anew into the ocean. He wanted to think it over.
Once, painful to relate, he had thoughts of failing to keep the

appointment. However, she was so jolly and frank. And what a fancy

she must have taken to him! No, he would see it through.
IV
If anybody had prophesied to Ellis that he would be driving out

a Wakes girl in a dogcart that Sunday afternoon he would have

laughed at the prophet; but so it occurred. He arrived at the

Turk's Head at two twenty-five. 102 She was there before

him, dressed all in blue, except the white shoes and stockings,

weighing herself on the machine in the yard. She showed her teeth,

told him she weighed nine stone one, and abruptly asked him if he

could drive. He said he could. She clapped her hands and sprang off

the machine. Her father had bought a new mare the day before, and

it was in the Turk's Head stable, and the yardman said it wanted

exercise, and there was a dogcart and harness idling about, and, in

short, Ellis should drive her to Sneyd Park, which she had long

desired to see.
Ellis wished to ask questions, but the moment did not seem

auspicious.
In a few minutes the new mare, a high and somewhat frisky bay,

with big shoulders, was in the shafts of a high, green dogcart.

When asked if he could drive, Ellis ought to have answered: 'That

depends—on the horse.' Many men can tool a fifteen-year-old

screw down a country lane who would hesitate to get up behind a

five-year-old animal (in need of exercise) for a spin down Broad

Street, Hanbridge, on Knype Wakes Sunday. Ellis could drive; he

could just drive. His father 103 had always

steadfastly refused to keep horses, but the fathers of other dogs

were more progressive, and Ellis had had opportunities. He knew how

to take the reins, and get up, and give the office; indeed, he had

read a handbook on the subject. So he rook the reins and got up,

and the Wakes girl got up.
He chirruped. The mare merely backed.
'Give 'er 'er mouth,' said the yardman disgustedly.
'Oh!' said Ellis, and slackened the reins, and the mare pawed

forward.
Then he had to turn her in the yard, and get her and the dogcart

down the passage. He doubted whether he should do it, for the

passage seemed a size too small. However, he did it, or the mare

did it, and the entire organism swerved across a portion of the

footpath into Broad Street.
For quite a quarter of a mile down Broad Street Ellis blushed,

and kept his gaze between the mare's ears. However, the mare went

beautifully. You could have driven her with a silken thread, so it

seemed. And then the dog, growing accustomed to his prominence up

there on the dogcart, began to be a bit 104 doggy. He knew the

little thing's age and weight, but, really, when you take a girl

out for a Sunday spin you want more information about her than

that. Her asked her name, and her name was Jenkins—Ada. She

was the great Jenkins's daughter.
('Oh,' thought Ellis, 'the deuce you are!')
'Father's gone to Manchester for the day, and aunt's looking

after me,' said Ada.
'Do they know you've come out—like this?'
'Not much!' She laughed deliciously. 'How lovely it is!'
At Knype they drew up before the Five Towns Hotel and descended.

The Five Towns Hotel is the greatest hotel in North Staffordshire.

It has two hundred rooms. It would not entirely disgrace

Northumberland Avenue. In the Five Towns it is august, imposing,

and unique. They had a lemonade there, and proceeded. A clock

struck; it was a near thing. No more refreshments now until they

had passed the three-mile limit!
Yes! Not two hundred yards further on she spied an ice-cream

shop in Fleet Road, 105 and Ellis learnt that she adored ice-cream.

The mare waited patiently outside in the thronged street.
After that the pilgrimage to Sneyd was punctuated with

ice-creams. At the Stag at Sneyd (where, among ninety-and-nine

dogcarts, Ellis's dogcart was the brightest green of them all) Ada

had another lemonade, and Ellis had something else. They saw the

Park, and Ada giggled charmingly her appreciation of its beauty.

The conversation throughout consisted chiefly of Ada's teeth. Ellis

said he would return by a different route, and he managed to get

lost. How anyone driving to Hanbridge from Sneyd could arrive at

the mining village of Silverton is a mystery. But Ellis arrived

there, and he ultimately came out at Hillport, the aristocratic

suburb of Bursley, where he had always lived till the last year. He

feared recognition there, and his fear was justified. Some silly

ass, a schoolmate, cried, 'Go it!' as the machine bowled along, and

the mischief was that the mare, startled, went it. She went it down

the curving hill, and the vehicle after her, like a kettle tied to

a dog's tail.
Ellis winked stoutly at Ada when they 106 reached the bottom,

and gave the mare a piece of his mind, to which she objected. As

they crossed the railway-bridge a goods-train ran underneath and

puffed smoke into the mare's eyes. She set her ears back.
'Would you!' cried Ellis authoritatively, and touched her with

the whip (he had forgotten the handbook).
He scarcely touched her, but you never know where you are with

any horse. That mare, which had been a mirror of all the virtues

all the afternoon, was off like a rocket. She overtook an electric

car as if it had been standing still. Ellis sawed her mouth; he

might as well have sawed the funnel of a locomotive. He had meant

to turn off and traverse Bursley by secluded streets, but he

perceived that safety lay solely in letting her go straight ahead

up the very steep slope of Oldcastle Street into the middle of the

town. It would be an amazing mare that galloped to the top of

Oldcastle Street! She galloped nearly to the top, and then Ellis

began to get hold of her a bit.
'Don't be afraid,' he said masculinely to Ada.
107 And, conscious of victory, he jerked the mare

to the left to avoid an approaching car....
The next instant they were anchored against the roots of a

lamp-post. When Ellis saw the upper half of the lamp-post bent down

at right angles, and pieces of glass covering the pavement, he

could not believe that he and his dogcart had done that, especially

as neither the mare, nor the dogcart, nor its freight, was damaged.

The machine was merely jammed, and the mare, satisfied, stood

quiet, breathing rapidly.
But Ada Jenkins was crying.
And the car stopped a moment to observe. And then a number of

chapel-goers on their way to the Sytch Chapel, which the Carter

family still faithfully attended, joined the scene; and then a

policeman.
Ellis sat like a stuck pig in the dogcart. He knew that speech

was demanded of him, but he did not know where to begin.
The worst thing of all was the lamp-post, bent, moveless,

unnatural, atrociously comic, accusing him.
The affair was over the town in a minute; 108 the next morning it

reached Llandudno. Ellis Carter had been out on the spree with a

Wakes girl in a dogcart on Sunday afternoon, and had got into

such a condition that he had driven into a lamp-post at the top of

Oldcastle Street just as people were going into chapel.
The lamp-post remained bent for three days—a fearful

warning to all dogs that doggishness has limits.
If it had not been a dogcart, and such a high, green dogcart; if

it had been, say, a brougham, or even a cab! If it had not been

Sunday! And, granting Sunday, if it had not been just as people

were going into chapel! If he had not chosen that particular

lamp-post, visible both from the market-place and St. Luke's

Square! If he had only contrived to destroy a less obtrusive

lamp-post in some unfrequented street! And if it had not been a

Wakes girl—if the reprobate had only selected for his guilty

amours an actress from one of the touring companies, or even a star

from the Hanbridge Empire—yea, or even a local barmaid! But

a Wakes girl!
Ellis himself saw the enormity of his transgression. 109 He lay

awake astounded by his own doggishness.
And yet he had seldom felt less doggy than during that trip. It

seemed to him that doggishness was not the glorious thing he had

thought. However, he cut a heroic figure at the dogs' club. Every

admiring face said: 'Well, you have been going the pace! We

always knew you were a hot un, but, really——'
V
On the following Friday evening, when Ellis jumped off the car

opposite his home on the Hawkins, he saw in the road, halted, a

train of vast and queer-shaped waggons in charge of two

traction-engines. They were painted on all sides with the great

name of Jenkins. They contained Jenkins's roundabouts and

shooting-saloons, on their way to rouse the joy of life in other

towns. And he perceived in front of the portico the high, green

dogcart and the lamp-post-destroying mare.
He went in. The family had come home that afternoon. Sundry of

his sisters greeted 110 him with silent horror on their faces in the

hall. In the breakfast-room, which gave off the drawing-room, was

his mother in the attitude of an intent listener. She spoke no

word.
And Ellis listened, too.
'Yes,' a very powerful and raucous voice was saying in the

drawing-room, 'I reckoned I'd call and tell ye myself, Mister

Carter, what I thought on it. My gell, a motherless gell, but

brought up respectable; sixth standard at Whalley Range Board

School; and her aunt a strict God-fearing woman! And here your son

comes along and gets hold of the girl while her aunt's at the

special service for Wakes folks in Bethesda Chapel, and runs off

with her in my dogcart with one of my hosses, and raises a scandal

all o'er the Five Towns. God bless my soul, mister! I tell'n ye I

hardly liked to open o' Monday afternoon, I was that ashamed! And I

packed Ada off to Manchester. It seems to me that if the upper

classes, as they call 'em—the immoral classes I call

'em—'ud look after themselves a bit instead o' looking after

other people so much, things might be a bit better, Mister Carter.

I dare say you 111 think it's nothing as your son should go about

ruining the reputation of any decent, respectable girl as he

happens to fancy, Mister Carter; but this is what I say. I

say——'
Mr. Carter was understood to assert, in his most pacific and

pained public-meeting voice, that he regretted, infinitely

regretted——
Mrs. Carter, weeping, ran out of the breakfast-room.
And soon afterwards the traction-engines rumbled off, and the

high, green dogcart followed them.
Ellis sat spell-bound.
He heard the parlourmaid go into the drawing-room and announce,

'Tea is ready, sir!' and then his father's dry cough.
And then the parlourmaid came into the breakfast-room: 'Tea is

ready, Mr. Ellis!'
Oh, the meal!

A FEUD

When Clive Timmis paused at the side-door of Ezra Brunt's great

shop in Machin Street, and the door was opened to him by Ezra

Brunt's daughter before he had had time to pull the bell, not only

all Machin Street knew it within the hour, but also most persons of

consequence left in Hanbridge on a Thursday

afternoon—Thursday being early-closing day. For Hanbridge,

though it counts sixty thousand inhabitants, and is the chief of

the Five Towns—that vast, huddled congeries of boroughs

devoted to the manufacture of earthenware—is a place where

the art of attending to other people's business still flourishes in

rustic perfection.
Ezra Brunt's drapery establishment was the foremost retail

house, in any branch of trade, of the Five Towns. It had no rival

nearer than Manchester, thirty-six miles off; and 
116 even Manchester

could exhibit nothing conspicuously superior to it. The most

acutely critical shoppers of the Five Towns—women who were in

the habit of going to London every year for the January

sales—spoke of Brunt's as a 'right-down good shop.' And the

husbands of these ladies, manufacturers who employed from two

hundred to a thousand men, regarded Ezra Brunt as a commercial

magnate of equal importance with themselves. Brunt, who had served

his apprenticeship at Birmingham, started business in Machin Street

in 1862, when Hanbridge was half its present size and all the best

shops of the district were in Oldcastle, an ancient burg contiguous

with, but holding itself proudly aloof from, the industrial Five

Towns. He paid eighty pounds a year rent, and lived over the shop,

and in the summer quarter his gas bill was always under a

sovereign. For ten years success tarried, but in 1872 his daughter

Eva was born and his wife died, and from that moment the sun of his

prosperity climbed higher and higher into heaven. He had been

profoundly attached to his wife, and, having lost her he abandoned

himself to the mercantile struggle with that 117 morose and terrible

ferocity which was the root of his character. Of rude, gaunt

aspect, gruffly taciturn by nature, and variable in temper, he yet

had the precious instinct for soothing customers. To this day he

can surpass his own shop-walkers in the admirable and tender

solicitude with which, forsaking dialect, he drops into a lady's

ear his famous stereotyped phrase: 'Are you receiving proper

attention, madam?' From the first he eschewed the facile trickeries

and ostentations which allure the populace. He sought a high-class

trade, and by waiting he found it. He would never advertise on

hoardings; for many years he had no signboard over his shop-front;

and whereas the name of 'Bostocks,' the huge cheap drapers lower

down Machin Street, on the opposite side, attacks you at every

railway-station and in every tramcar, the name of 'E. Brunt' is to

be seen only in a modest regular advertisement on the front page of

the Staffordshire Signal. Repose, reticence,

respectability—it was these attributes which he decided his

shop should possess, and by means of which he succeeded. To enter

Brunt's, with its silently swinging doors, its broad, easy

staircases, its long floors 118 covered with warm,

red linoleum, its partitioned walls, its smooth mahogany counters,

its unobtrusive mirrors, its rows of youths and virgins in black,

and its pervading atmosphere of quietude and discretion, was like

entering a temple before the act of oblation has commenced. You

were conscious of some supreme administrative influence everywhere

imposing itself. That influence was Ezra Brunt. And yet the man

differed utterly from the thing he had created. His was one of

those dark and passionate souls which smoulder in this harsh

Midland district as slag-heaps smoulder on the pit-banks, revealing

their strange fires only in the darkness.
In 1899 Brunt's establishment occupied four shops, Nos. 52, 56,

58, and 60, in Machin Street. He had bought the freeholds at a

price which timid people regarded as exorbitant, but the solicitors

of Hanbridge secretly applauded his enterprise and shrewdness in

anticipating the enormous rise in ground-values which has now been

in rapid, steady progress there for more than a decade. He had

thrown the interiors together and rebuilt the frontages in handsome

freestone. He had also purchased 119 several shops

opposite, and rumour said that it was his intention to offer these

latter to the Town Council at a low figure if the Council would cut

a new street leading from his premises to the Market Square. Such a

scheme would have met with general approval. But there was one

serious hiatus in the plans of Ezra Brunt—to wit, No. 54,

Machin Street. No. 54, separating 52 and 56, was a chemist's shop,

shabby but sedate as to appearance, owned and occupied by George

Christopher Timmis, a mild and venerable citizen, and a local

preacher in the Wesleyan Methodist Connexion. For nearly thirty

years Brunt had coveted Mr. Timmis's shop; more than twenty years

have elapsed since he first opened negotiations for it. Mr. Timmis

was by no means eager to sell—indeed, his attitude was

distinctly a repellent one—but a bargain would undoubtedly

have been concluded had not a report reached the ears of Mr. Timmis

to the effect that Ezra Brunt had remarked at the Turk's Head that

'th' old leech was only sticking out for every brass farthing he

could get.' The report was untrue, but Mr. Timmis believed it, and

from that moment Ezra Brunt's 120 chances of obtaining

the chemist's shop vanished completely. His lawyer expended

diplomacy in vain, raising the offer week by week till the

incredible sum of three thousand pounds was reached. Then Ezra

Brunt himself saw Mr. Timmis, and without a word of prelude

said:
'Will ye take three thousand guineas for this bit o'

property?'
'Not thirty thousand guineas,' said Mr. Timmis quietly; the

stern pride of the benevolent old local preacher had been

aroused.
'Then be damned to you!' said Ezra Brunt, who had never been

known to swear before.
Thenceforth a feud existed, not less bitter because it was a

feud in which nothing was said and nothing done—a silent and

implacable mutual resistance. The sole outward sign of it was the

dirty and stumpy brown-brick shop-front of Mr. Timmis, squeezed in

between those massive luxurious façades of stone which Ezra

Brunt soon afterwards erected. The pharmaceutical business of Mr.

Timmis was not a very large one, and, fiscally, Ezra Brunt could

have swallowed him at a meal and suffered no inconvenience; but in

that the aged chemist had lived on just half his 
121 small income for

some fifty years past, his position was impregnable. Hanbridge

smiled cynically at this impasse produced by an idle word,

and, recognising the equality of the antagonists, leaned neither to

one side nor to the other. At intervals, however, the legend of the

feud was embroidered with new and effective detail in the mouth of

some inventive gossip, and by degrees it took high place among

those piquant social histories which illustrate the real life of a

town, and which parents recount to their children with such zest in

moods of reminiscence.
When George Christopher Timmis buried his wife, Ezra Brunt, as a

near neighbour, was asked to the funeral. 'The cortège will

move at 1.30,' ran the printed invitation, and at 1.15 Brunt's

carriage was decorously in place behind the hearse and the two

mourning-coaches. The demeanour of the chemist and the draper

towards each other was a sublime answer to the demands of the

occasion; some people even said that the breach had been healed,

but these were not of the discerning.
The most active person at the funeral was the chemist's only

nephew, Clive Timmis, 122 partner in a small

but prosperous firm of majolica manufacturers at Bursley. Clive,

who was seldom seen in Hanbridge, made a favourable impression on

everyone by his pleasing, unaffected manner and his air of

discretion and success. He was a bachelor of thirty-two, and lived

in lodgings at Bursley. On the return of the funeral-party from the

cemetery, Clive Timmis found Brunt's daughter Eva in his uncle's

house. Uninvited, she had left her place in the private room at her

father's shop in order to assist Timmis's servant Sarah in the

preparation of that solid and solemn repast which must inevitably

follow every proper interment in the Five Towns. Without false

modesty, she introduced herself to one or two of the men who had

surprised her at her work, and then quietly departed just as they

were sitting down to table and Sarah had brought in the hot

tea-cakes. Clive Timmis saw her only for a moment, but from that

moment she was his one thought. During the evening, which he spent

alone with his uncle, he behaved in every particular as a nephew

should, yet he was acting a part; his real self roved after Ezra

Brunt's daughter, wherever she might be. 123 Clive had never

fallen in love, though several times in his life he had tried hard

to do so. He had long wished to marry—wished ardently; he had

even got into the way of regarding every woman he met—and he

met many—in the light of a possible partner. 'Can it be

she? he had asked himself a thousand times, and then

answered half sadly, 'No.' Not one woman had touched his

imagination, coincided with his dream. It is strange that after

seeing Eva Brunt he forgot thus to interrogate himself. For a

fortnight, while he went his ways as usual, her image occupied his

heart, throwing that once orderly chamber into the wildest

confusion; and he let it remain, dimly aware of some delicious

danger. He inspected the image every night before he slept, and

every morning when he awoke, and made no effort to define its

distracting charm; he knew only that Eva Brunt was absolutely and

in every detail unlike all other women. On the second Sunday he

murmured during the sermon: 'But I only saw her for a minute.' A

few days afterwards he took the tram to Hanbridge.
'Uncle,' he said, 'how should you like me to come and live here

with you? I've been 124 thinking things out a bit, and I thought

perhaps you'd like it. I expect you must feel rather lonely

now.'
The neat, fragrant shop was empty, and the two men stood behind

the big glass-fronted case of Burroughs and Wellcome's

preparations. Clive's venerable uncle happened to be looking into a

drawer marked 'Gentianæ Rad. Pulv.' He closed the drawer with

slow hesitation, and then, stroking his long white beard, replied

in that deliberate voice which seemed always to tremble with

religious fervour:
'The hand of the Lord is in this thing, Clive. I have wished

that you might come to live here with me. But I was afraid it would

be too far from the works.'
'Pooh! that's nothing,' said Clive.
As he lingered at the shop door for the Bursley car to pass the

end of Machin Street, Eva Brunt went by. He raised his hat with

diffidence, and she smiled. It was a marvellous chance. His heart

leapt into a throb which was half agony and half delight.
'I am in love,' he said gravely.
He had just discovered the fact, and the discovery filled him

with exquisite apprehension.
125 If he had waited till the age of thirty-two

for that springtime of the soul which we call love, Clive had not

waited for nothing. Eva was a woman to enravish the heart of a man

whose imagination could pierce the agitating secrets immured in

that calm and silent bosom. Slender and scarcely tall, she belonged

to the order of spare, slight-made women, who hide within their

slim frames an endowment of profound passion far exceeding that of

their more voluptuously-formed sisters, who never coarsen into

stoutness, and who at forty are as disturbing as at twenty. At this

date Eva was twenty-six. She had a rather small, white face, which

was a mask to the casual observer, and the very mirror of her

feelings to anyone with eyes to read its signs.
'I tell you what you are like,' said Clive to her once: 'you are

like a fine racehorse, always on the quiver.'
Yet many people considered her cold and impassive. Her walk and

bearing showed a sensitive independence, and when she spoke it was

usually in tones of command. The girls in the shop, where she was a

power second only to Ezra Brunt, were a little afraid of her,

126

chiefly because she poured terrible scorn on their small

affectations, jealousies, and vendettas. But they liked her

because, in their own phrase, 'there was no nonsense about' this

redoubtable woman. She hated shams and make-believes with a bitter

and ruthless hatred. She was the heiress to at least five thousand

a year, and knew it well, but she never encouraged her father to

complicate their simple mode of life with the pomps of wealth. They

lived in a house with a large garden at Pireford, which is on the

summit of the steep ridge between the Five Towns and Oldcastle, and

they kept two servants and a coachman, who was also gardener. Eva

paid the servants good wages, and took care to get good value

therefor.
'It's not often I have any bother with my servants,' she would

say, 'for they know that if there is any trouble I would just as

soon clear them out and put on an apron and do the work

myself.'
She was an accomplished house-mistress, and could bake her own

bread: in towns not one woman in a thousand can bake. With the

coachman she had little to do, for she could 127 not rid herself of a

sentimental objection to the carriage—it savoured of 'airs';

when she used it she used it as she might use a tramcar. It was her

custom, every day except Saturday, to walk to the shop about eleven

o'clock, after her house had been set in order. She had been

thoroughly trained in the business, and had spent a year at a

first-rate shop in High Street, Kensington. Millinery was her

speciality, and she still watched over that department with a

particular attention; but for some time past she had risen beyond

the limitations of departments, and assisted her father in the

general management of the vast concern. In commercial aptitude she

resembled the typical Frenchwoman.
Although he was her father, Ezra Brunt had the wit to recognise

her talents, and he always listened to her suggestions, which,

however, sometimes startled him. One of them was that he should

import into the Five Towns a modiste from Paris, offering a salary

of two hundred a year. The old provincial stood aghast. He had the

idea that all Parisian women were stage-dancers. And to pay four

pounds a week to a female!
128 Nevertheless, Mademoiselle Bertot—styled

in the shop 'Madame'—now presides over Ezra Brunt's

dressmakers, draws her four pounds a week (of which she saves two),

and by mere nationality has given a unique distinction and success

to her branch of the business.
Eva occupied a small room opening off the principal showroom,

and during hours of work she issued thence but seldom. Only

customers of the highest importance might speak with her. She was a

power felt rather than seen. Employés who knocked at her

door always did so with a certain awe of what awaited them on the

other side, and a consciousness that the moment was unsuitable for

levity. 'If you please, Miss Eva——'. Here she gave

audience to the 'buyers' and window-dressers, listened to

complaints and excuses, and occasionally had a secret orgy of

afternoon tea with one or two of her friends. None but these few

girls—mostly younger than herself, and remarkable only in

that their dislike of the snobbery of the Five Towns, though less

fiercely displayed, agreed with her own—really knew Eva. To

them alone did she unveil herself, and by them she was

idolized.
129 'She is simply splendid when you know

her—such a jolly girl!' they would say to other people; but

other people, especially other women, could not believe it. They

fearfully respected her because she was very well dressed and had

quantities of money. But they called her 'a curious creature'; it

was inconceivable to them that she should choose to work in a shop;

and her tongue had a causticity which was sometimes exceedingly

disconcerting and mortifying. As for men, she was shy of them, and,

moreover, she loathed the elaborate and insincere ritual of

deference which the average man practises towards women unrelated

to him, particularly when they are young and rich. Her father she

adored, without knowing it; for he often angered her, and

humiliated her in private. As for the rest, she was, after all,

only six-and-twenty.
'If you don't mind, I should like to walk along with you,' Clive

Timmis said to her one Sunday evening in the porch of the Bethesda

Chapel.
'I shall be glad,' she answered at once; 'father isn't here, and

I'm all alone.'
Ezra Brunt was indeed seldom there, counting 
130 in the matter of

attendance at chapel among what were called 'the weaker

brethren.'
'I am going over to Oldcastle,' Clive explained calmly.
So began the formal courtship—more than a month after

Clive had settled in Machin Street, for he was far too discreet to

engender by precipitancy any suspicion in the haunts of scandal

that his true reason for establishing himself in his uncle's

household was a certain rich young woman who was to be found every

day next door. Guided as much by instinct as by tact, Clive

approached Eva with an almost savage simplicity and naturalness of

manner, ignoring not only her father's wealth, but all the feigned

punctilio of a wooer. His face said: 'Let there be no beating about

the bush—I like you.' Hers answered: 'Good! we will see.'
From the first he pleased her, and not least in treating her

exactly as she would have wished to be treated—namely, as a

quite plain person of that part of the middle class which is

neither upper nor lower. Few men in the Five Towns would have been

capable of forgetting Ezra Brunt's income in talking to 131 Ezra

Brunt's daughter. Fortunately, Timmis had a proud, confident

spirit—the spirit of one who, unaided, has wrested success

from the world's deathlike clutch. Had Eva the reversion of fifty

thousand a year instead of five, he, Clive, was still a prosperous

plain man, well able to support a wife in the position to which God

had called him.
Their walks together grew more and more frequent, and they

became intimate, exchanging ideas and rejoicing openly at the

similarity of those ideas. Although there was no concealment in

these encounters, still, there was a circumspection which resembled

the clandestine. By a silent understanding Clive did not enter the

house at Pireford; to have done so would have excited remark, for

this house, unlike some, had never been the rendezvous of young

men; much less, therefore, did he invade the shop. No! The chief

part of their love-making (for such it was, though the term would

have roused Eva's contemptuous anger) occurred in the streets; in

this they did but follow the traditions of their class. Thus, the

idyll, so matter-of-fact upon the surface, but within which glowed

secret and adorable fires, 132 progressed towards

its culmination. Eva, the artless fool—oh, how simple are the

wisest at times!—thought that the affair was hid from the

shop. But was it possible? Was it possible that in those tiny

bedrooms on the third floor, where the heavy evening hours were

ever lightened with breathless interminable recitals of what some

'he' had said and some 'she' had replied, such an enthralling

episode should escape discovery? The dormitories knew of Eva's

'attachment' before Eva herself. Yet none knew how it was known.

The whisper arose like Venus from a sea of trivial gossip,

miraculously, exquisitely. On the night when the first rumour of it

traversed the passages there was scarcely any sleep at Brunt's,

while Eva up at Pireford slumbered as a young girl.
On the Thursday afternoon with which we began, Brunt's was

deserted save for the housekeeper and Eva, who was writing letters

in her room.
'I saw you from my window, coming up the street,' she said to

Clive, 'and so I ran down to open the door. Will you come into

father's room? He is in Manchester for the day, buying.
133 'I knew that,' said Timmis.
'How did you know?' She observed that his manner was somewhat

nervous and constrained.
'You yourself told me last night—don't you remember?'
'So I did.'
'That's why I sent the note round this morning to say I'd call

this afternoon. You got it, I suppose?'
She nodded thoughtfully.
'Well, what is this business you want to talk about?'
It was spoken with a brave carelessness, but he caught the

tremor in her voice, and saw her little hand shake as it lay on the

table amid her father's papers. Without knowing why he should do

so, he stepped hastily forward and seized that hand. Her emotion

unmanned him. He thought he was going to cry; he could not account

for himself.
'Eva,' he said thickly, 'you know what the business is; you

know, don't you?'
She smiled. That smile, the softness of her hand, the sparkle in

her eye, the heave of her small bosom ... it was the divinest

miracle! 134 Clive, manufacturer of majolica, went hot and

then cold, and then his wits were suddenly his own again.
'That's all right,' he murmured, and sighed, and placed on Eva's

lips the first kiss that had ever lain there.
'Dear boy,' she said later, 'you should have come up to

Pireford, not here, and when father was there.'
'Should I?' he answered happily. 'It just occurred to me all of

a sudden this morning that you would be here, and that I couldn't

wait.'
'You will come up to-night and see father?'
'I had meant to.'
'You had better go home now.'
'Had I?'
She nodded, putting her lips tightly together—a trick of

hers.
'Come up about half-past eight.'
'Good! I will let myself out.'
He left her, and she gazed dreamily at the window, which looked

on to a whitewashed yard. The next moment someone else entered the

room with heavy footsteps. She turned round a little startled.
135 It was her father.
'Why! You are back early, father! How——' She

stopped. Something in the old man's glance gave her a premonition

of disaster. To this day she does not know what accident brought

him from Manchester two hours sooner than usual, and to Machin

Street instead of Pireford.
'Has young Timmis been here?' he inquired curtly.
'Yes.'
'Ha!' with subdued, sinister satisfaction, 'I saw him going out.

He didna see me.' Ezra Brunt deposited his hat and sat down.
Intimate with all her father's various moods, she saw instantly

and with terrible certainty that a series of chances had fatally

combined themselves against her. If only she had not happened to

tell Clive that her father would be at Manchester this day! If only

her father had adhered to his customary hour of return! If only

Clive had had the sense to make his proposal openly at Pireford

some evening! If only he had left a little earlier! If only her

father had not caught him going out by the side-door on a Thursday

afternoon when the 136 place was empty! Here, she guessed, was the

suggestion of furtiveness which had raised her father's unreasoning

anger, often fierce, and always incalculable.
'Clive Timmis has asked me to marry him, father.'
'Has he!'
'Surely you must have known, father, that he and I were seeing

each other a great deal.'
'Not from your lips, my girl.'
'Well, father——' Again she stopped, this strong and

capable woman, gifted with a fine brain to organize and a powerful

will to command. She quailed, robbed of speech, before the

causeless, vindictive, and infantile wrath of an old man who

happened to be in a bad temper. She actually felt like a naughty

schoolgirl before him. Such is the tremendous influence of lifelong

habit, the irresistible power of the patria potestas when it

has never been relaxed. Ezra Brunt saw in front of him only a

cowering child. 'Clive is coming up to see you to-night,' she went

on timidly, clearing her throat.
'Humph! Is he?'
The rosy and tender dream of five minutes ago lay in fragments

at Eva's feet. She brooded 137 with stricken

apprehension upon the forms of obstruction which his despotism

might choose.

The next morning Clive and his uncle breakfasted together as

usual in the parlour behind, the chemist's shop.
'Uncle,' said Clive brusquely, when the meal was nearly

finished, 'I'd better tell you that I've proposed to Eva

Brunt.'
Old George Timmis lowered the Manchester Guardian and

gazed at Clive over his steel-rimmed spectacles.
'She is a good girl,' he remarked; 'she will make you a good

wife. Have you spoken to her father?'
'That's the point. I saw him last night, and I'll tell you what

he said. These were his words: "You can marry my daughter, Mr.

Timmis, when your uncle agrees to part with his shop!"'
'That I shall never do, nephew,' said the aged patriarch quietly

and deliberately.
'Of course you won't, uncle. I shouldn't think of suggesting it.

I'm merely telling you what he said.' Clive laughed harshly. 'Why,'

he added, 'the man must be mad!'
138 'What did the young woman say to that?' his

uncle inquired.
Clive frowned.
'I didn't see her last night,' he said. 'I didn't ask to see

her. I was too angry.'
Just then the post arrived, and there was a letter for Clive,

which he read and put carefully in his waistcoat pocket.
'Eva writes asking me to go to Pireford to-night,' he said,

after a pause. 'I'll soon settle it, depend on that. If Ezra Brunt

refuses his consent, so much the worse for him. I wonder whether he

actually imagines that a grown man and a grown woman are to be....

Ah well, I can't talk about it! It's too silly. I'll be off to the

works.'
When Clive reached Pireford that night, Eva herself opened the

door to him. She was wearing a gray frock, and over it a large

white apron, perfectly plain.
'My girls are both out to-night,' she said, 'and I was making

some puffs for the sewing-meeting tea. Come into the

breakfast-room.... This way,' she added, guiding him. He had

entered the house on the previous night for the first time. She

spoke hurriedly, and, 139 instead of stopping

in the breakfast-room, wandered uncertainly through it into the

greenhouse, to which it gave access by means of a French window. In

the dark, confined space, amid the close-packed blossoms, they

stood together. She bent down to smell at a musk-plant. He took her

hand and drew her soft and yielding form towards him and kissed her

warm face.
'Oh, Clive!' she said. 'Whatever are we to do?'
'Do?' he replied, enchanted by her instinctive feminine

surrender and reliance upon him, which seemed the more precious in

that creature so proud and reserved to all others. 'Do! Where is

your father?'
'Reading the Signal in the dining-room.'
Every business man in the Five Towns reads the Staffordshire

Signal from beginning to end every night.
'I will see him. Of course he is your father; but I will just

tell him—as decently as I can—that neither you nor I

will stand this nonsense.'
'You mustn't—you mustn't see him.'
'Why not?'
140 'It will only lead to unpleasantness.'
'That can't be helped.'
'He never, never changes when once he has said a thing. I

know him.'
Clive was arrested by something in her tone, something new to

him, that in its poignant finality seemed to have caught up and

expressed in a single instant that bitterness of a lifetime's

renunciation which falls to the lot of most women.
'Will you come outside?' he asked in a different voice.
Without replying, she led the way down the long garden, which

ended in an ivy-grown brick wall and a panorama of the immense

valley of industries below. It was a warm, cloudy evening. The last

silver tinge of an August twilight lay on the shoulder of the hill

to the left. There was no moon, but the splendid watch-fires of

labour flamed from ore-heap and furnace across the whole expanse,

performing their nightly miracle of beauty. Trains crept with

noiseless mystery along the middle distance, under their canopies

of yellow steam. Further off the far-extending streets of Hanbridge

made a map of starry lines on 141 the blackness. To

the south-east stared the cold, blue electric lights of Knype

railway-station. All was silent, save for a distant thunderous

roar, the giant breathing of the forge at Cauldon Bar

Ironworks.
Eva leaned both elbows on the wall and looked forth.
'Do you mean to say,' said Clive, 'that Mr. Brunt will actually

stick by what he has said?'
'Like grim death,' said Eva.
'But what's his idea?'
'Oh! how can I tell you?' she burst out passionately.
'Perhaps I did wrong. Perhaps I ought to have warned him

earlier—said to him, "Father, Clive Timmis is courting me!"

Ugh! He cannot bear to be surprised about anything. But yet he must

have known.... It was all an accident, Clive—all an accident.

He saw you leaving the shop yesterday. He would say he

caught you leaving the shop—sneaking off

like——'
'But, Eva——'
'I know—I know! Don't tell me! But it was that, I am sure.

He would resent the 142 mere look of things, and then he would think

and think, and the notion of your uncle's shop would occur to him

again, after all these years. I can see his thoughts as plain ...

My dear, if he had not seen you at Machin Street yesterday, or if

you had seen him and spoken to him, all might have gone right. He

would have objected, but he would have given way in a day or two.

Now he will never give way! I asked you just now what was to be

done, but I knew all the time that there was nothing.'
'There is one thing to be done, Eva, and the sooner the

better.'
'Do you mean that old Mr. Timmis must give up his shop to my

father? Never! never!'
'I mean,' said Clive quietly, 'that we must marry without your

father's consent.'
She shook her head slowly and sadly, relapsing into

calmness.
'You shake your head, Eva, but it must be so.'
'I can't, my dear.'
'Do you mean to say that you will allow your father's childish

whim—for it's nothing 143 else; he can't find

any objection to me as a husband for you, and he knows

it—that you will allow his childish whim to spoil your life

and mine? Remember, you are twenty-six and I am thirty-two.'
'I can't do it! I daren't! I'm mad with myself for feeling like

this, but I daren't! And even if I dared I wouldn't. Clive, you

don't know! You can't tell how it is!'
Her sorrowful, pathetic firmness daunted him. She was now

composed, mistress again of herself, and her moral force dominated

him.
'Then, you and I are to be unhappy all our lives, Eva?'
The soft influences of the night seemed to direct her voice as,

after a long pause, she uttered the words: 'No one is ever quite

unhappy in all this world.' There was another pause, as she gazed

steadily down into the wonderful valley. 'We must wait.'
'Wait!' echoed Clive with angry grimness. 'He will live for

twenty years!'
'No one is ever quite unhappy in all this world,' she repeated

dreamily, as one might turn over a treasure in order to examine

it.
144 Now for the epilogue to the feud. Two years

passed, and it happened that there was to be a Revival at the

Bethesda Chapel. One morning the superintendent minister and the

revivalist called on Ezra Brunt at his shop. When informed of their

presence, the great draper had an impulse of anger, for, like many

stouter chapel-goers than himself, he would scarcely tolerate the

intrusion of religion into commerce. However, the visit had an air

of ceremony, and he could not decline to see these ambassadors of

heaven in his private room. The revivalist, a cheery, shrewd man,

whose powers of organization were obvious, and who seemed to put

organization before everything else, pleased Ezra Brunt at

once.
'We want a specially good congregation at the opening meeting

to-night,' said the revivalist. 'Now, the basis of a good

congregation must necessarily be the regular pillars of the church,

and therefore we are making a few calls this morning to insure the

presence of our chief men—the men of influence and position.

You will come, Mr. Brunt, and you will let it be known among your

employés that they will please you by coming too?'
145 Ezra Brunt was by no means a regular pillar of

the Bethesda, but he had a vague sensation of flattery, and he

consented; indeed, there was no alternative.
The first hymn was being sung when he reached the chapel. To his

surprise, he found the place crowded in every part. A man whom he

did not know led him to a wooden form which had been put in the

space between the front pews and the Communion-rail. He felt

strange there, and uneasy, apprehensive.
The usual discreet somnolence of the chapel had been disturbed

as by some indecorous but formidable awakener; the air was

electric; anything might occur. Ezra was astounded by the mere

volume of the singing; never had he heard such singing. At the end

of the hymn the congregation sat down, hiding their faces in

expectation. The revivalist stood erect and terrible in the pulpit,

no longer a shrewd, cheery man of the world, but the very

mouthpiece of the wrath and mercy of God. Ezra's self-importance

dwindled before that gaze, till, from a renowned magnate of the

Five Towns, he became an item in the multitude 
146 of suppliants. He

profoundly wished he had never come.
'Remember the hymn,' said the revivalist, with austere

emphasis:

'"My richest gain I count but

loss, And pour contempt on all my

pride."'

The admirable histrionic art with which he intensified the

consonants in the last line produced a tremendous effect. Not for

nothing was this man cerebrated throughout Methodism as a saver of

souls. When, after a pause, he raised his hand and ejaculated, 'Let

us pray,' sobs could be heard throughout the chapel. The Revival

had begun.
At the end of a quarter of an hour Ezra Brunt would have given

fifty pounds to be outside, but he could not stir; he was

magnetized. Soon the revivalist came down from the pulpit and stood

within the Communion-rail, whence he addressed the nearmost part of

the people in low, soothing tones of persuasion. Apparently he

ignored Ezra Brunt, but the man was convicted of sin, and felt

himself melting like an icicle in front of a fire. He recalled the

days of his youth, the piety of his father and mother, 147 and the

long traditions of a stern Dissenting family. He had backslidden,

slackened in the use of the means of grace, run after the things of

this world. It is true that none of his chiefest iniquities

presented themselves to him; he was quite unconscious of them even

then; but the lesser ones were more than sufficient to overwhelm

him. Class-leaders were now reasoning with stricken sinners, and

Ezra, who could not take his eyes off the revivalist, heard the

footsteps of those who were going to the 'inquiry-room' for more

private counsel. In vain he argued that he was about to be

ridiculous; that the idea of him, Ezra Brunt, a professed Wesleyan

for half a century, being publicly 'saved' at the age of

fifty-seven was not to be entertained; that the town would talk;

that his business might suffer if for any reason he should be

morally bound to apply to it too strictly the principles of the New

Testament. He was under the spell. The tears coursed down his long

cheeks, and he forgot to care, but sat entranced by the

revivalist's marvellous voice. Suddenly, with an awful sob, he bent

and hid his face in his hands. The spectacle of the old, proud man

helpless in the grasp of 148 profound emotion was

a sight to rend the heart-strings.
'Brother, be of good cheer,' said a tremulous and benign voice

above him. 'The love of God compasseth all things. Only

believe.'
He looked up and saw the venerable face and long white beard of

George Christopher Timmis.
Ezra Brunt shrank away, embittered and ashamed.
'I cannot,' he murmured with difficulty.
'The love of God is all-powerful.'
'Will it make you part with that bit o' property, think you?'

said Ezra Brunt, with a kind of despairing ferocity.
'Brother,' replied the aged servant of God, unmoved, 'if my shop

is in truth a stumbling-block in this solemn hour, you shall have

it.'
Ezra Brunt was staggered.
'I believe! I believe!' he cried.
'Praise God!' said the chemist, with majestic joy.

Three months afterwards Eva Brunt and Clive Timmis were married.

It is characteristic of the fine sentimentality which underlies the

149

surface harshness of the inhabitants of the Five Towns that, though

No. 54 Machin Street was duly transferred to Ezra Brunt, the

chemist retiring from business, he has never rebuilt it to accord

with the rest of his premises. In all its shabbiness it stands

between the other big dazzling shops as a reminding monument.

PHANTOM

I
The heart of the Five Towns—that undulating patch of

England covered with mean streets, and dominated by tall smoking

chimneys, whence are derived your cups and saucers and plates, some

of your coal, and a portion of your iron—is Hanbridge, a

borough larger and busier than its four sisters, and even more

grimy and commonplace than they. And the heart of Hanbridge is

probably the offices of the Five Towns Banking Company, where the

last trace of magic and romance is beaten out of human existence,

and the meaning of life is expressed in balances, deposits,

percentages, and overdrafts—especially overdrafts. In a fine

suite of rooms on the first floor of the bank building resides Mr.

Lionel Woolley, the manager, with his wife May and their

children. 154

Mrs. Woolley is compelled to change her white window-curtains once a week

because of the smuts. Mr. Woolley, forty-five, rather bald, frigidly

suave, positive, egotistic, and pontifical, is a specimen of the man of

business who is nothing else but a man of business. His career has been

a calculation from which sentiment is entirely omitted; he has no

instinct for the things which cannot be defined and assessed. Scarcely a

manufacturer in Hanbridge but who inimically and fearfully regards Mr.

Woolley as an amazing instance of a creature without a soul; and the

absence of soul in a fellow-man must be very marked indeed before a

Hanbridge manufacturer notices it. There are some sixty thousand

immortal souls in Hanbridge, but they seldom attract attention.
Yet Mr. Woolley was once brought into contact with the things

which cannot be defined and assessed; once he stood face to face

with some strange visible resultant of those secret forces that lie

beyond the human ken. And, moreover, the adventure affected the

whole of his domestic life. The wonder and the pathos of the story

lie in the fact that 155 Nature, prodigal

though she is known to be, should have wasted the rare and

beautiful visitation on just Mr. Woolley. Mr. Woolley was bathed in

romance of the most singular kind, and the precious fluid ran off

him like water off a duck's back.
II
Ten years ago on a Thursday afternoon in July, Lionel Woolley,

as he walked up through the new park at Bursley to his celibate

rooms in Park Terrace, was making addition sums out of various

items connected with the institution of marriage. Bursley is next

door to Hanbridge, and Lionel happened then to be cashier of the

Bursley branch of the bank. He had in mind two possible wives, each

of whom possessed advantages which appealed to him, and he was

unable to decide between them by any mathematical process.

Suddenly, from a glazed shelter near the empty bandstand, there

emerged in front of him one of the delectable creatures who had

excited his fancy. May Lawton was twenty-eight, an orphan, and a

schoolmistress. She, too, had 156 celibate rooms in

Park Terrace, and it was owing to this coincidence that Lionel had

made her acquaintance six months previously. She was not pretty,

but she was tall, straight, well dressed, well educated, and not

lacking in experience; and she had a little money of her own.
'Well, Mr. Woolley,' she said easily, stopping for him as she

raised her sunshade, 'how satisfied you look!'
'It's the sight of you,' he replied, without a moment's

hesitation.
He had a fine assured way with women (he need not have envied a

curate accustomed to sewing meetings), and May Lawton belonged to

the type of girl whose demeanour always challenges the masculine in

a man. Gazing at her, Lionel was swiftly conscious of several

things: the piquancy of her snub nose, the brightness of her smile,

at once defiant and wistful, the lingering softness of her gloved

hand, and the extraordinary charm of her sunshade, which matched

her dress and formed a sort of canopy and frame for that

intelligent, tantalizing face. He remembered that of late he and

she had grown very intimate; and it 157 came upon him with a

shock, as though he had just opened a telegram which said so, that

May, and not the other girl, was his destined mate. And he thought

of her fortune, tiny but nevertheless useful, and how clever she

was, and how inexplicably different from the rest of her sex, and

how she would adorn his house, and set him off, and help him in his

career. He heard himself saying negligently to friends: 'My wife

speaks French like a native. Of course, my wife has travelled a

great deal. My wife has thoroughly studied the management of

children. Now, my wife does understand the art of dress. I put my

wife's bit of money into so-and-so.' In short, Lionel was as near

being in love as his character permitted.
And while he walked by May's side past the bowling-greens at the

summit of the hill, she lightly quizzing the raw newness of the

park and its appurtenances, he wondered, he honestly wondered, that

he could ever have hesitated between May Lawton and the other. Her

superiority was too obvious; she was a woman of the world! She....

In a flash he knew that he would propose to her that 158 very

afternoon. And when he had suggested a stroll towards Moorthorne,

and she had deliciously agreed, he was conscious of a tumultuous

uplifting and splendid carelessness of spirits. 'Imagine me

bringing it to a climax to-day,' he reflected, profoundly pleased

with himself. 'Ah well, it will be settled once for all!' He

admired his own decision; he was quite struck by it. 'I shall call

her May before I leave her,' he thought, gazing at her, and

discovering how well the name suited her, with its significances of

alertness, geniality, and half-mocking coyness.
'So school is closed,' he said, and added humorously: '"Broken

up" is the technical term, I believe.'
'Yes,' she answered, 'and I had walked out into the park to

meditate seriously upon the question of my holiday.'
She caught his eye in a net of bright glances, and romance was

in the air. They had crossed a couple of smoke-soiled fields, and

struck into the old Hanbridge road just below the abandoned

toll-house with its broad eaves.
'And whither do your meditations point?' he demanded

playfully.
159 'My meditations point to Switzerland,' she

said. 'I have friends in Lausanne.'
The reference to foreign climes impressed him.
'Would that I could go to Switzerland too!' he exclaimed; and

privately: 'Now for it! I'm about to begin.'
'Why?' she questioned, with elaborate simplicity.
At the moment, as they were passing the toll-house, the other

girl appeared surprisingly from round the corner of the toll-house,

where the lane from Toft End joins the highroad. This second

creature was smaller than Miss Lawton, less assertive, less

intelligent, perhaps, but much more beautiful.
Everyone halted and everyone blushed.
'May!' the interrupter at length stammered.
'May!' responded Miss Lawton lamely.
The other girl was named May too—May Deane, child of the

well-known majolica manufacturer, who lived with his sons and

daughter in a solitary and ancient house at Toft End.
Lionel Woolley said nothing until they had all shaken

hands—his famous way with women 160 seemed to have

deserted him—and then he actually stated that he had

forgotten an appointment, and must depart. He had gone before the

girls could move.
When they were alone, the two Mays fronted each other, confused,

hostile, almost homicidal.
'I hope I didn't spoil a tête-à-tête,'

said May Deane, stiffly and sharply, in a manner quite foreign to

her soft and yielding nature.
The schoolmistress, abandoning herself to an inexplicable but

overwhelming impulse, took breath for a proud lie.
'No,' she answered; 'but if you had come three minutes

earlier——'
She smiled calmly.
'Oh!' murmured May Deane, after a pause.
III
That evening May Deane returned home at half-past nine. She had

been with her two brothers to a lawn-tennis party at Hillport, and

she told her father, who was reading the Staffordshire

Signal in his accustomed solitude, that the boys were staying

later for cards, but 161 that she had

declined to stay because she felt tired. She kissed the old widower

good-night, and said that she should go to bed at once. But before

retiring she visited the housekeeper in the kitchen in order to

discuss certain household matters: Jim's early breakfast, the

proper method of washing Herbert's new flannels (Herbert would be

very angry if they were shrunk), and the dog-biscuits for Carlo.

These questions settled, she went to her room, drew the blind,

lighted some candles, and sat down near the window.
She was twenty-two, and she had about her that strange and

charming nunlike mystery which often comes to a woman who lives

alone and unguessed-at among male relatives. Her room was her

bower. No one, save the servants and herself, ever entered it. Mr.

Deane and Jim and Bertie might glance carelessly through the open

door in passing along the corridor, but had they chanced in idle

curiosity to enter, the room would have struck them as unfamiliar,

and they might perhaps have exclaimed with momentary interest, 'So

this is May's room!' And some hint that May was more than a

daughter and sister—a 162 woman, withdrawn,

secret, disturbing, living her own inner life side by side with the

household life—might have penetrated their obtuse paternal

and fraternal masculinity. Her beautiful face (the nose and mouth

were perfect, and at either extremity of the upper lip grew a soft

down), her dark hair, her quiet voice and her gentle acquiescence

(diversified by occasional outbursts of sarcasm), appealed to them

and won them; but they accepted her as something of course, as

something which went without saying. They adored her, and did not

know that they adored her.
May took off her hat, stuck the pins into it again, and threw it

on the bed, whose white and green counterpane hung down nearly to

the floor on either side. Then she lay back in the chair, and,

pulling away the blind, glanced through the window; the moon,

rather dim behind the furnace lights of Red Cow Ironworks, was

rising over Moorthorne. May dropped the blind with a wearied

gesture, and turned within the room, examining its contents as if

she had not seen them before: the wardrobe, the chest of drawers,

which was also a dressing-table, the washstand, the dwarf book-case

163

with its store of Edna Lyalls, Elizabeth Gaskells, Thackerays,

Charlotte Yonges, Charlotte Brontës, a Thomas Hardy or so, and

some old school-books. She looked at the pictures, including a

sampler worked by a deceased aunt, at the loud-ticking Swiss clock

on the mantelpiece, at the higgledy-piggledy photographs there, at

the new Axminster carpet, the piece of linoleum in front of the

washstand, and the bad joining of the wallpaper to the left of the

door. She missed none of the details which she knew so well, with

such long monotonous intimacy, and sighed.
Then she got up from the chair, and, opening a small drawer in

the chest of drawers, put her hand familiarly to the back and drew

forth a photograph. She carried the photograph to the light of the

candles on the mantelpiece, and gazed at it attentively, puckering

her brows. It was a portrait of Lionel Woolley. Heaven knows by

what subterfuge or lucky accident she had obtained it, for Lionel

certainly had not given it to her. She loved Lionel. She had loved

him for five years, with a love silent, blind, intense, irrational,

164

and too elemental to be concealed. Everyone knew of May's passion.

Many women admired her taste; a few were shocked and puzzled by it.

All the men of her acquaintance either pitied or despised her for

it. Her father said nothing. Her brothers were less cautious, and

summed up their opinion of Lionel in the curt, scornful assertion

that he showed a tendency to cheat at tennis. But May would never

hear ill of him; he was a god to her, and she could not hide her

worship. For more than a year, until lately, she had been almost

sure of him, and then came a faint vague rumour concerning Lionel

and May Lawton, a rumour which she had refused to take seriously.

The encounter of that afternoon, and Miss Lawton's triumphant

remark, had dazed her. For seven hours she had existed in a kind of

semi-conscious delirium, in which she could perceive nothing but

the fatal fact, emerging more clearly every moment from the welter

of her thoughts, that she had lost Lionel. Lionel had proposed to

May Lawton, and been accepted, just before she surprised them

together; and Lionel, with a man's excusable cowardice, 165 had

left his betrothed to announce the engagement.
She tore up the photograph, put the fragments in the grate, and

set a light to them.
Her father's step sounded on the stairs; he hesitated, and

knocked sharply at her door.
'What's burning, May?'
'It's all right, father,' she answered calmly, 'I'm only burning

some papers in the fire-grate.'
'Well, see you don't burn the house down.'
He passed on.
Then she found a sheet of notepaper, and wrote on it in pencil,

using the mantelpiece for a desk: 'Dear home. Good-night,

good-bye.' She cogitated, and wrote further: 'Forgive

me.—MAY.'
She put the message in an envelope, and wrote on the envelope

'Jim,' and placed it prominently in front of the clock. But after

she had looked at it for a minute, she wrote 'Father' above Jim,

and then 'Herbert' below.
There were noises in the hall; the boys had returned earlier

than she expected. As they went along the corridor and caught a

glimpse 166 of her light under the door, Jim cried gaily:

'Now then, out with that light! A little thing like you ought to be

asleep hours since.'
She listened for the bang of their door, and then, very

hurriedly, she removed her pink frock and put on an old black one,

which was rather tight in the waist. And she donned her hat,

securing it carefully with both pins, extinguished the candles, and

crept quietly downstairs, and so by the back-door into the garden.

Carlo, the retriever, came halfway out of his kennel and greeted

her in the moonlight with a yawn. She patted his head and ran

stealthily up the garden, through the gate, and up the waste green

land towards the crown of the hill.
IV
The top of Toft End is the highest land in the Five Towns, and

from it may be clearly seen all the lurid evidences of manufacture

which sweep across the borders of the sky on north, east, west, and

south. North-eastwards lie the moorlands, and far off Manifold, the

'metropolis of the moorlands,' as it is called. On 167 this

night the furnaces of Red Cow Ironworks, in the hollow to the east,

were in full blast; their fluctuating yellow light illuminated

queerly the grass of the fields above Deane's house, and the

regular roar of their breathing reached that solitary spot like the

distant rumour of some leviathan beast angrily fuming. Further away

to the south-west the Cauldon Bar Ironworks reproduced the same

phenomena, and round the whole horizon, near and far, except to the

north-east, the lesser fires of labour leapt and flickered and

glinted in their mists of smoke, burning ceaselessly, as they

burned every night and every day at all seasons of all years. The

town of Bursley slept in the deep valley to the west, and vast

Hanbridge in the shallower depression to the south, like two

sleepers accustomed to rest quietly amid great disturbances; the

beacons of their Town Halls and churches kept watch, and the whole

scene was dominated by the placidity of the moon, which had now

risen clear of the Red Cow furnace clouds, and was passing upwards

through tracts of stars.
Into this scene, climbing up from the direction of Manifold,

came Lionel Woolley, nearly 168 at midnight, having

walked some eighteen miles in a vain effort to re-establish his

self-satisfaction by a process of reasoning and ingenious excuses.

Lionel felt that in the brief episode of the afternoon he had

scarcely behaved with dignity. In other words, he was fully and

painfully aware that he must have looked a fool, a coward, an ass,

a contemptible and pitiful person, in the eyes of at least one

girl, if not of two. He did not like this—no man would have

liked it; and to Lionel the memory of an undignified act was acute

torture. Why had he bidden the girls adieu and departed? Why had

he, in fact, run away? What precisely would May Lawton think of

him? How could he explain his conduct to her—and to himself?

And had that worshipping, affectionate thing, May Deane, taken note

of his confusion—of the confusion of him who was never

confused, who was equal to every occasion and every emergency?

These were some of the questions which harried him and declined to

be settled. He had walked to Manifold, and had tea at the Roebuck,

and walked back, and still the questions were harrying; and as he

came over the hill by the 169 field-path, and

descried the lone house of the Deanes in the light of the Red Cow

furnaces and of the moon, the worship of May Deane seemed suddenly

very precious to him, and he could not bear to think that any

stupidity of his should have impaired it.
Then he saw May Deane walking slowly across the field, close to

an abandoned pit-shaft, whose low protecting circular wall of brick

was crumbling to ruin on the side nearest to him.
She stopped, appeared to gaze at him intently, turned, and began

to approach him. And he too, moved by a mysterious impulse which he

did not pause to examine, swerved, and quickened his step in order

to lessen the distance between them. He did not at first even feel

surprise that she should be wandering solitary on the hill at that

hour. Presently she stood still, while he continued to move

forward. It was as if she drew him; and soon, in the pale moonlight

and the wavering light of the furnaces, he could decipher all the

details of her face, and he saw that she was smiling fondly,

invitingly, admiringly, lustrously, with the old undiminished

worship and affection. And he perceived a dark discoloration on her

right 170 cheek, as though she had suffered a blow, but

this mark did not long occupy his mind. He thought suddenly of the

strong probability that her father would leave a nice little bit of

money to each of his three children; and he thought of her beauty,

and of her timid fragility in the tight black dress, and of her

immense and unquestioning love for him, which would survive all

accidents and mishaps. He seemed to sink luxuriously into this

grand passion of hers (which he deemed quite natural and proper) as

into a soft feather-bed. To live secure in an atmosphere of

exhaustless worship; to keep a fount of balm and admiration for

ever in the house, a bubbling spring of passionate appreciation

which would be continually available for the refreshment of his

self-esteem! To be always sure of an obedience blind and willing, a

subservience which no tyranny and no harshness and no whim would

rouse into revolt; to sit on a throne with so much beauty kneeling

at his feet!
And the possession of her beauty would be a source of legitimate

pride to him. People would often refer to the beautiful Mrs.

Woolley.
171 He felt that in sending May Deane to interrupt

his highly emotional conversation with May Lawton Providence had

watched over him and done him a good turn. May Lawton had

advantages, and striking advantages, but he could not be sure of

her. The suspicion that if she married him she would marry him for

her own ends caused him a secret disquiet, and he feared that one

day, perhaps one morning at breakfast, she might take it into her

intelligent head to mock him, to exercise upon him her gift of

irony, and to intimate to him that if he fancied she was his slave

he was deceived. That she sincerely admired him he never for an

instant doubted. But——
And, moreover, the unfortunate episode of the afternoon might

have cooled her ardour to freezing-point.
He stood now in front of his worshipper, and the notion crossed

his mind that in after-years he could say to his friends: 'I

proposed to my wife at midnight under the moon. Not many men have

done that.'
'Good-evening,' he ventured to the girl; and he added with

bravado: 'We've met before to-day, haven't we?'
172 She made no reply, but her smile was more

affectionate, more inviting, than ever.
'I'm glad of this opportunity—very glad,' he proceeded.

'I've been wanting to ... You must know, my dear girl, how I

feel....'
She gave a gesture, charming in its sweet humility, as if to

say: 'Who am I that I should dare——'
And then he proposed to her, asked her to share his life, and

all that sort of thing; and when he had finished he thought, 'It's

done now, anyway.'
Strange to relate, she offered no immediate reply, but she bent

a little towards him with shining, happy eyes. He had an impulse to

seize her in his arms and kiss her, but prudence suggested that he

should defer the rite. She turned and began to walk slowly and

meditatively towards the pit-shaft. He followed almost at her side,

but a foot or so behind, waiting for her to speak. And as he

waited, expectant, he looked at her profile and reflected how well

the name May suited her, with its significances of shyness and

dreamy hope, and hidden fire and the modesty of spring.
And while he was thus savouring her face, 173 and they were still

ten yards from the pit-shaft, she suddenly disappeared from his

vision, as it were by a conjuring trick. He had a horrible

sensation in his spinal column. He was not the man to mistrust the

evidence of his senses, and he knew, therefore, that he had been

proposing to a phantom.
V
The next morning—early, because of Jim's early

breakfast—when May Deane's disappearance became known to the

members of the household, Jim had the idea of utilizing Carlo in

the search for her. The retriever went straight, without a fault,

to the pit-shaft, and May was discovered alive and unscathed, save

for a contusion of the face and a sprain in the wrist.
Her suicidal plunge had been arrested, at only a few feet from

the top of the shaft, by a cross-stay of timber, upon which she lay

prone. There was no reason why the affair should be made public,

and it was not. It was suppressed into one of those secrets which

embed themselves 174 in the history of families, and after two or

three generations blossom into romantic legends full of appropriate

circumstantial detail.
Lionel Woolley spent a woeful night at his rooms. He did not

know what to do, and on the following day May Lawton encountered

him again, and proved by her demeanour that the episode of the

previous afternoon had caused no estrangement. Lionel vacillated.

The sway of the schoolmistress was almost restored, and it would

have been restored fully had he not been preoccupied by a feverish

curiosity—the curiosity to know whether or not May Deane was

dead. He felt that she must indeed be dead, and he lived through

the day expectant of the news of her sudden decease. Towards night

his state of mind was such that he was obliged to call at the

Deanes'. May heard him, and insisted on seeing him; more, she

insisted on seeing him alone in the breakfast-room, where she

reclined, interestingly white, on the sofa. Her father and brothers

objected strongly to the interview, but they yielded, afraid that a

refusal might induce hysteria and worse things.
175 And when Lionel Woolley came into the room,

May, steeped in felicity, related to him the story of her impulsive

crime.
'I was so happy,' she said, 'when I knew that Miss Lawton had

deceived me.' And before he could inquire what she meant, she

continued rapidly: 'I must have been unconscious, but I felt you

were there, and something of me went out towards you. And oh! the

answer to your question—I heard your question; the real

me heard it, but that something could not speak.'
'My question?'
'You asked a question, didn't you?' she faltered, sitting

up.
He hesitated, and then surrendered himself to her immense love

and sank into it, and forgot May Lawton.
'Yes,' he said.
'The answer is yes. Oh, you must have known the answer would be

yes! You did know, didn't you?'
He nodded grandly.
She sighed with delicious and overwhelming joy.
In the ecstasy of the achievement of her 176 desire the girl gave

little thought to the psychic aspect of the possibly unique

wooing.
As for Lionel, he refused to dwell on it even in thought. And so

that strange, magic, yearning effluence of a soul into a visible

projection and shape was ignored, slurred over, and, after ten

years of domesticity in the bank premises, is gradually being

forgotten.
He is a man of business, and she, with her fading beauty, her

ardent, continuous worship of the idol, her half-dozen small

children, the eldest of whom is only eight, and the white

window-curtains to change every week because of the smuts—do

you suppose she has time or inclination to ponder upon the theory

of the subliminal consciousness and kindred mysteries?


179


TIDDY-FOL-LOL

It was the dinner-hour, and a group of ragged and clay-soiled

apprentice boys were making a great noise in the yard of Henry

Mynors and Co.'s small, compact earthenware manufactory up at Toft

End. Toft End caps the ridge to the east of Bursley; and Bursley,

which has been the home of the potter for ten centuries, is the

most ancient of the Five Towns in Staffordshire. The boys, dressed

for the most part in shirt, trousers, and boots, all equally ragged

and insecure, were playing at prison-bars.
Soon the game ended abruptly in a clamorous dispute upon a point

of law, and it was not recommenced. The dispute dying a natural

death, the tireless energies of the boys needed a fresh outlet.

Inspired by a common instinct, they began at once to bait one of

their number, 180 a slight youngster of twelve years, much

better clothed than the rest, who had adventurously strolled in

from a neighbouring manufactory. This child answered their jibes in

an amiable, silly, drawling tone which seemed to justify the

epithet 'Loony,' frequently applied to him. Now and then he

stammered; and then companions laughed loud, and he with them. It

was known that several years ago he had fallen down a flight of

stone steps, alighting on the back of his head, and that ever since

he had been deaf of one ear and under some trifling mental

derangement. His sublime calmness under their jests baffled them

until the terrible figure of Mr. Machin, the engine-man, standing

at the door of the slip-house, caught their attention and suggested

a plan full of joyous possibilities. They gathered round the lad,

and, talking in subdued murmurs, unanimously urged him with many

persuasions to a certain course of action. He declined the scheme,

and declined again. Suddenly a boy shouted:
'Thee dars' na'!'
'I dare,' was the drawled, smiling answer.
'I tell thee thee dars' na'!'
'I tell thee I dare.' And thereupon he 181 slowly but

resolutely set out for the slip-house door and Mr. Machin.
Eli Machin was beyond doubt the most considerable employé

on Clarke's 'bank' (manufactory). Even Henry Clarke approached him

with a subtly-indicated deference, and whenever Silas Emery, the

immensely rich and miserly sleeping partner in the firm, came up to

visit the works, these two old men chatted as old friends. In a

modern earthenware manufactory the engine-room is the source of all

activity, for, owing to the inventive genius of a famous and

venerable son of the Five Towns, steam now presides at nearly every

stage in the long process of turning earth into ware. It moves the

pug-mill, the jollies, and the marvellous batting machines, dries

the unfired clay, heats the printers' stoves, and warms the offices

where the 'jacket-men' dwell. Coal is a tremendous item in the cost

of production, and a competent, economical engine-man can be sure

of good wages and a choice of berths; he is desired like a good

domestic servant. Eli Machin was the prince of engine-men. His

engine never went wrong, his coal bills were never extravagant, and

(supreme 182 virtue!) he was never absent on Mondays. From

his post in the slip-house he watched over the whole works like a

father, stern, gruff, forbidding, but to be trusted absolutely. He

was sixty years old, and had been 'putting by' for nearly half a

century. He lived in a tiny villa-cottage with his bed-ridden,

cheerful wife, and lent small sums on mortgage of approved

freeholds at 5 per cent.—no more and no less. Secure behind

this rampart of saved money, he was the equal of the King on the

throne. Not a magnate in all the Five Towns who would dare to be

condescending to Eli Machin. He had been a sidesman at the old

church. A trades-union had once asked him to become a working-man

candidate for the Bursley Town Council, but he had refused because

he did not care for the possibility of losing caste by being

concerned in a strike. His personal respectability was entirely

unsullied, and he worshipped this abstract quality as he worshipped

God.
There was only one blot—but how foul!—on Eli

Machin's career, and that had been dropped by his daughter Miriam,

when, defying his authority, she married a scene-shifter at

Hanbridge Theatre. The atrocious idea of 183 being connected with

the theatre had rendered him speechless for a time. He could but

endure it in the most awful silence that ever hid passionate

feeling. Then one day he had burst out, 'The wench is no better

than a tiddy-fol-lol!' Only this solitary phrase—nothing

else.
What a tiddy-fol-lol was no one quite knew; but the word,

getting about, stuck to him, and for some weeks boys used to shout

it after him in the streets, until he caught one of them, and in

thirty seconds put an end to the practice. Thenceforth Miriam, with

all hers, was dead to him. When her husband expired of consumption,

Eli Machin saw the avenging arm of the Lord in action; and when her

boy grew to be a source of painful anxiety to her, he said to

himself that the wrath of Heaven was not yet cooled towards this

impious daughter. The passage of fifteen years had apparently in no

way softened his resentment.
The challenged lad in Mynors' yard slowly approached the

slip-house door, and halted before Eli Machin, grinning.
'Well, young un,' the old man said absently, 'what dost

want?'
184 'Tiddy-fol-lol, grandfeyther,' the child

drawled in his silly, irritating voice, and added: 'They said I

darena say it to ye.'
Without and instant's hesitation Eli Machin raised his still

powerful arm, and, catching the boy under the ear, knocked him

down. The other boys yelled with unaffected pleasure and ran

away.
'Get up, and be off wi' ye. Ye dunna belong to this bank,' said

Eli Machin in cold anger to the lad. But the lad did not stir; the

lad's eyes were closed, and he lay white on the stones.
Eli Machin bent down, and peered through his spectacles at the

prone form upon which the mid-day sun was beating.
'It's Miriam's boy!' he ejaculated under his breath, and looked

round as if in inquiry—the yard was empty. Then with quick

decision he picked up this limp and inconvenient parcel of humanity

and hastened—ran—with it out of the yard into the

road.
Down the road he ran, turned to the left into Clowes Street, and

stopped before a row of small brown cottages. At the open door of

one of these cottages a woman sat sewing. 185 She was rather stout

and full-bosomed, with a fair, fresh face, full of sense and peace;

she looked under thirty, but was older.
'Here's thy Tommy, Miriam,' said Eli Machin shortly. 'He give me

some of his sauce, and I doubt I've done him an injury.'
The woman dropped her sewing.
'Eh, dear!' she cried, 'is that lad o' mine in mischief again? I

do hope he's no limb brokken.'
'It in'na that,' said the old man, 'but he's dazed-like. Better

lay him on th' squab.'
She calmly took Tommy and placed him gently down on the

check-covered sofa under the window. 'Come in, father, do.'
The man obeyed, astonished at the entire friendliness of this

daughter, whom, though he had frequently seen her, he had never

spoken to for more than ten years. Her manner, at once filial and

quite natural, perfectly ignored the long breach, and disclosed no

trace of animosity.
Father and daughter examined the unconscious child. Pale,

pulseless, cold, he lay on the sofa like a corpse except for the

short, faint breaths which he drew through his blue lips.
186 'I doubt I've killed him,' said Eli.
'Nay, nay, father!' And her face actually smiled. This supremacy

of the soul against years of continued misfortune lifted her high

above him, and he suddenly felt himself an inferior creature.
'I'll go for th' doctor,' he said.
'Nay! I shall need ye.' And she put her head out of the window.

'Mrs. Walley, will ye let your Lucy run quick for th' club doctor?

my Tommy's hurt.'
The whole street awoke instantly from its nap, and in a few

moments every door was occupied. Miriam closed her own door softly,

as though she might wake the boy, and spoke in whispers to people

through the window, finally telling them to go away. When the

doctor came, half an hour afterwards, she had done all that she

knew for Tommy, without the slightest apparent result.
'What is it?' asked the doctor curtly, as he lifted the child's

thin and lifeless hand.
Eli Machin explained that he had boxed the boy's ear.
'Tommy was impudent to his grandfather,' Miriam added

hastily.
187 'Which ear?' the doctor inquired. It was the

left. He gazed into it, and then raised the boy's right leg and

arm. 'There is no paralysis,' he said. Then he felt the heart, and

then took out his stethoscope and applied it, listening

intently.
'Canst hear owt?' the old man said.
'I cannot,' he answered.
'Don't say that, doctor—don't say that! said Miriam, with

an accent of appeal.
'In these cases it is almost impossible to tell whether the

patient is alive or dead. We must wait. Mrs. Baddeley, make a

mustard plaster for his feet, and we will put another over the

heart.' And so they waited one hour, while the clock ticked and the

mustard plasters gradually cooled. Then Tommy's lips parted.
After another half-hour the doctor said:
'I must go now; I will come again at six. Do nothing but apply

fresh plasters. Be sure to keep his neck free. He is breathing, but

I may as well be plain with you—there is a great risk of your

child dying in this condition.'
Neighbours were again at the window, and Miriam drew the blind,

waving them away. At six o'clock the doctor reappeared. 'There

188

is no change,' he remarked. 'I will call in before I go to

bed.'
When he lifted the latch for the third time, at ten o'clock, Eli

Machin and Miriam still sat by the sofa, and Tommy still lay

thereon, moveless, a terrible enigma. But the glass lamp was

lighted on the mantelpiece, and Miriam's sewing, by which she

earned a livelihood, had been hidden out of sight.
'There is no change,' said the doctor. 'You can do nothing

except hope.'
'And pray,' the calm mother added.
Eli neither stirred nor spoke. For nine hours he had absolutely

forgotten his engine. He knew the boy would die.
The clock struck eleven, twelve, one, two, three, each time

fretting the nerves of the old man like a rasp. It was the hour of

summer dawn. A cold gray light fell unkindly across the small

figure on the sofa.
'Open th' door a bit, father,' said Miriam. 'This parlour's

gettin' close; th' lad canna breathe.'
'Nay, lass,' Eli sighed, as he stumbled obediently to the door.

'The lad'll breathe no more. I've killed him i' my anger.' He

189

frowned heavily, as though someone was annoying him.
'Hist!' she exclaimed, when, after extinguishing the lamp, she

returned to her boy's side. 'He's reddened—he's reddened!

Look thee at his cheeks, father!' She seized the child's inert

hands and rubbed them between her own. The blood was now plain in

Tommy's face. His legs faintly twitched. His breathing was slower.

Miriam moved the coverlet and put her head upon his heart. 'It's

beating loud, father,' she cried. 'Bless God!'
Eli stared at the child with the fixity of a statue. Then Tommy

opened his eyes for an instant. The old man groaned. Tommy looked

vacantly round, closed his eyes again, and was unmistakably asleep.

He slept for one minute, and then waked. Eli involuntarily put a

hand on the sofa. Tommy gazed at him, and, with the most heavenly

innocent smile of recognition, lightly touched his grandfather's

hand. Then he turned over on his right side. In the anguish of

sudden joy Eli gave a deep, piteous sob. That smile burnt into him

like a coal of fire.
'Now for the beef-tea,' said Miriam, crying.
190 'Beef-tea?' the boy repeated after her, mildly

questioning.
'Yes, my poppet,' she answered; and then aside, 'Father, he can

hear i' his left ear. Did ye notice it?'
'It's a miracle—a miracle of God!' said Eli.
In a few hours Tommy was as well as ever—indeed, better;

not only was his hearing fully restored, but he had ceased to

stammer, and the thin, almost imperceptible cloud upon his

intellect was dissipated. The doctor expressed but little surprise

at these phenomena, and, in fact, stated that similar things had

occurred often before, and were duly written down in the books of

medicine. But Eli Machin's firm, instinctive faith that Providence

had intervened will never be shaken.
Miriam and Tommy now live in the villa-cottage with the old

people.

THE IDIOT

William Froyle, ostler at the Queen's Arms at Moorthorne, took

the letter, and, with a curt nod which stifled the loquacity of the

village postman, went at once from the yard into the coach-house.

He had recognised the hand-writing on the envelope, and the

recognition of it gave form and quick life to all the vague

suspicions that had troubled him some months before, and again

during the last few days. He felt suddenly the near approach of a

frightful calamity which had long been stealing towards him.
A wire-sheathed lantern, set on a rough oaken table, cast a

wavering light round the coach-house, and dimly showed the inner

stable. Within the latter could just be distinguished the

mottled-gray flanks of a fat cob which dragged its chain

occasionally, making 194 the large slow

movements of a horse comfortably lodged in its stall. The pleasant

odour of animals and hay filled the wide spaces of the shed, and

through the half-open door came a fresh thin mist rising from the

rain-soaked yard in the November evening.
Froyle sat down on the oaken table, his legs dangling, and

looked again at the envelope before opening it. He was a man about

thirty years of age, with a serious and thoughtful, rather heavy

countenance. He had a long light moustache, and his skin was a

fresh, rosy salmon colour; his straw-tinted hair was cut very

short, except over the forehead, where it grew full and bushy.

Dressed in his rough stable corduroys, his forearms bare and white,

he had all the appearance of the sturdy Englishman, the sort of

Englishman that crosses the world in order to find vent for his

taciturn energy on virgin soils. From the whole village he

commanded and received respect. He was known for a scholar, and it

was his scholarship which had obtained for him the proud position

of secretary to the provident society styled the Queen's Arms Slate

Club. His respectability and his learning combined 195 had

enabled him to win with dignity the hand of Susie Trimmer, the

grocer's daughter, to whom he had been engaged about a year. The

village could not make up its mind concerning that match; without

doubt it was a social victory for Froyle, but everyone wondered

that so sedate and sagacious a man should have seen in Susie a

suitable mate.
He tore open the envelope with his huge forefinger, and, bending

down towards the lantern, began to read the letter. It ran:

'OLDCASTLE STREET,
'BURSLEY.
'DEAR WILL,
'I asked father to tell you, but he would not. He said I must

write. Dear Will, I hope you will never see me again. As you will

see by the above address, I am now at Aunt Penrose's at Bursley.

She is awful angry, but I was obliged to leave the village because

of my shame. I have been a wicked girl. It was in July. You know

the man, because you asked me about him one Sunday night. He is no

good. He is a villain. Please forget all about me. I want to go to

London. So many people know me here, and 196 what with people

coming in from the village, too. Please forgive me.
'S. TRIMMER.'

After reading the letter a second time, Froyle folded it up and

put it in his pocket. Beyond a slight unaccustomed pallor of the

red cheeks, he showed no sign of emotion. Before the arrival of the

postman he had been cleaning his master's bicycle, which stood

against the table. To this he returned. Kneeling down in some fresh

straw, he used his dusters slowly and patiently—rubbing, then

stopping to examine the result, and then rubbing again. When the

machine was polished to his satisfaction, he wheeled it carefully

into the stable, where it occupied a stall next to that of the cob.

As he passed back again, the animal leisurely turned its head and

gazed at Froyle with its large liquid eyes. He slapped the immense

flank. Content, the animal returned to its feed, and the weighted

chain ran down with a rattle.
The fortnightly meeting of the Slate Club was to take place at

eight o'clock that evening. Froyle had employed part of the

afternoon in 197 making ready his books for the event, to him

always so solemn and ceremonious; and the affairs of the club were

now prominent in his mind. He was sorry that it would be impossible

for him to attend the meeting; fortunately, all the usual

preliminaries were complete.
He took a piece of notepaper from a little hanging cupboard,

and, sprawling across the table, began to write under the lantern.

The pencil seemed a tiny toy in his thick roughened fingers:

'To Mr. Andrew McCall, Chairman Queen's Arms Slate

Club.
'DEAR SIR,
'I regret to inform you that I shall not be at the meeting

to-night. You will find the books in order....'

Here he stopped, biting the end of the pencil in thought. He put

down the pencil and stepped hastily out of the stable, across the

yard, and into the hotel. In the large room, the room where

cyclists sometimes took tea and cold meat during the summer season,

the 198 long deal table and the double line of oaken

chairs stood ready for the meeting. A fire burnt warmly in the big

grate, and the hanging lamp had been lighted. On the wall was a

large card containing the rules of the club, which had been written

out in a fair hand by the schoolmaster. It was to this card that

Froyle went. Passing his thumb down the card, he paused at Rule

VII.:

'Each member shall, on the death of another member, pay 1s. for

benefit of widow or nominee of deceased, same to be paid within one

month after notice given.'
'Or nominee—nominee,' he murmured reflectively, staring at

the card. He mechanically noticed, what he had noticed often before

with disdain, that the chairman had signed the rules without the

use of capitals.
He went back to the dusk of the coach-house to finish his

letter, still murmuring the word 'nominee,' of whose meaning he was

not quite sure:
'I request that the money due to me from the Slate Club on my

death shall be paid to 199 my nominee, Miss

Susan Trimmer, now staying with her aunt, Mrs. Penrose, at

Bursley.
'Yours respectfully,
'WILLIAM FROYLE.'

After further consideration he added:

'P.S.—My annual salary of sixpence per member would be due

at the end of December. If so be the members would pay that, or

part of it, should they consider the same due, to Susan Trimmer as

well, I should be thankful.—Yours resp, W.F.'

He put the letter in an envelope, and, taking it to the large

room, laid it carefully at the end of the table opposite the

chairman's seat. Once more he returned to the coach-house. From the

hanging cupboard he now produced a piece of rope. Standing on the

table he could just reach, by leaning forward, a hook in the

ceiling, that was sometimes used for the slinging of bicycles. With

difficulty he made the rope fast to the hook. Putting a noose on

the other end, he tightened it round his neck. He looked up at the

ceiling and down at the floor in order to judge whether the rope

was short enough.
200 'Good-bye, Susan, and everyone,' he whispered,

and then stepped off the table.
The tense rope swung him by his neck halfway across the

coach-house. He swung twice to and fro, but as he passed under the

hook for the fifth time his toes touched the floor. The rope had

stretched. In another second he was standing firm on the floor,

purple and panting, but ignominiously alive.
'Good-even to you, Mr. Froyle. Be you committing suicide?' The

tones were drawling, uncertain, mildly astonished.
He turned round hastily, his hands busy with the rope, and saw

in the doorway the figure of Daft Jimmy, the Moorthorne idiot.
He hesitated before speaking, but he was not confused. No one

could have been confused before Daft Jimmy. Neither man nor woman

in the village considered his presence more than that of a cat.
'Yes, I am,' he said.
The middle-aged idiot regarded him with a vague, interested

smile, and came into the coach-house.
'You'n gotten the rope too long, Mr. Froyle. Let me help

you.'
201 Froyle calmly assented. He stood on the table,

and the two rearranged the noose and made it secure. As they did so

the idiot gossiped:
'I was going to Bursley to-night to buy me a pair o' boots, and

when I was at top o' th' hill I remembered as I'd forgotten the

measure o' my feet. So I ran back again for it. Then I saw the

light in here, and I stepped up to bid ye good-evening.'
Someone had told him the ancient story of the fool and his

boots, and, with the pride of an idiot in his idiocy, he had

determined that it should be related of himself.
Froyle was silent.
The idiot laughed with a dry cackle.
'Now you go,' said Froyle, when the rope was fixed.
'Let me see ye do it,' the idiot pleaded with pathetic eyes.
'No; out you get!'
Protesting, the idiot went forth, and his irregular clumsy

footsteps sounded on the pebble-paved yard. When the noise of them

ceased in the soft roadway, Froyle jumped off the table again.

Gradually his body, like a 202 stopping pendulum,

came to rest under the hook, and hung twitching, with strange

disconnected movements. The horse in the stable, hearing

unaccustomed noises, rattled his chain and stamped about in the

straw of his box.
Furtive steps came down the yard again, and Daft Jimmy peeped

into the coach-house.
'He done it! he done it!' the idiot cried gleefully. 'Damned if

he hasna'.' He slapped his leg and almost danced. The body still

twitched occasionally. 'He done it!'
'Done what, Daft Jimmy? You're making a fine noise there! Done

what?'
The idiot ran out of the stable. At the side-entrance to the

hotel stood the barmaid, the outline of her fine figure distinct

against the light from within.
The idiot continued to laugh.
'Done what?' the girl repeated, calling out across the dark yard

in clear, pleasant tones of amused inquiry. 'Done what?'
'What's that to you, Miss Tucker?'
'Now, none of your sauce, Daft Jimmy! Is Willie Froyle in

there?'
The idiot roared with laughter.
'Yes, he is, miss.'
203 'Well, tell him his master wants him. I don't

want to cross this mucky, messy yard.'
'Yes, miss.'
The girl closed the door.
The idiot went into the coach-house, and, slapping William's

body in a friendly way so that it trembled on the rope, he

spluttered out between his laughs:
'Master wants ye, Mr. Froyle.'
Then he walked out into the village street, and stood looking up

the muddy road, still laughing quietly. It was quite dark, but the

moon aloft in the clear sky showed the highway with its shining

ruts leading in a straight line over the hill to Bursley.
'Them shoes!' the idiot ejaculated suddenly. 'Well, I be an

idiot, and that's true! They can take the measure from my feet, and

I never thought on it till this minute!'
Laughing again, he set off at a run up the hill.

PART II

ABROAD


207


THE HUNGARIAN RHAPSODY
I
After a honeymoon of five weeks in the shining cities of the

Mediterranean and in Paris, they re-entered the British Empire by

the august portals of the Chatham and Dover Railway. They stood

impatiently waiting, part of a well-dressed, querulous crowd, while

a few officials performed their daily task of improvising a

Custom-house for registered luggage on a narrow platform of

Victoria Station. John, Mr. Norris's man, who had met them,

attended behind. Suddenly, with a characteristic movement, the

husband lifted his head, and then looked down at his wife.
'I say, May!'
'Well?'
She knew that he was about to propose some swift alteration of

their plans, but she smiled 208 upwards out of her

furs at his grave face, and the tone of her voice granted all

requests in advance.
'I think I'd better go to the office,' he said.
'Now?'
She smiled again, inviting him to do exactly what he chose. She

was already familiar with his restiveness under enforced delays and

inaction, and his unfortunate capacity for being actively bored by

trifles which did not interest him aroused in her a sort of

maternal sympathy.
'Yes,' he answered. 'I can be there and back in an hour or less.

You titivate yourself, and we'll dine at the Savoy, or anywhere you

please. We'll keep the ball rolling to-night. Yes,' he repeated, as

if to convince himself that he was not a deserter, 'I really must

call in at the office. You and John can see to the luggage, can't

you?'
'Of course,' she replied, with calm good-nature, and also with

perfect self-confidence. 'But give me the keys of the trunks, and

don't be late, Ted.'
'Oh, I shan't be late,' he said.
Their fingers touched as she took the keys. 
209 He went away

enraptured anew by her delightful acquiescences, her unique smile,

her common-sense, her mature charm, and the astonishing elegance of

her person. The honeymoon was over—and with what finished

discretion, combining the innocent girl with the woman of the

world, she had lived through the honeymoon!—another life,

more delicious, was commencing.
'What a wife!' he thought triumphantly. 'She does understand a

man! And fancy leaving any ordinary bride to look after

luggage!'
Nevertheless, once in his offices at Winchester House, he

managed to forget her, and to forget time, for nearly an hour and a

half. When at last he came to himself from the enchantment of

affairs, he jumped into a hansom, and told the driver to drive fast

to Knightsbridge. He was ardent to see her again. In the dark

seclusion of the cab he speculated upon her toilette, the colour of

her shoes. He thought of the last five weeks, of the next five

years. Dwelling on their mutual love and esteem, their health,

their self-knowledge and experience and cheerfulness, her 210 sense

and grace, his talent for getting money first and keeping it

afterwards, he foresaw nothing but happiness for them. Children?

H'm! Possibly....
At Piccadilly Circus it began to rain—cold, heavy March

rain.
'Window down, sir?' asked the voice of the cabman.
'Yes,' he ordered sardonically. 'Better be suffocated than

drowned.'
'You're right, sir,' said the voice.
Soon, through the streaming glass, which made every gas-jet into

a shooting pillar of flame, Norris discerned vaguely the vast bulk

of Hyde Park Mansions. 'Good!' he muttered, and at that very moment

he was shot through the window into the thin, light-reflecting mire

of the street. Enormous and strange beasts menaced him with

pitiless hoofs. Millions of people crowded about him. In response

to a question that seemed to float slowly towards him, he tried to

give his address. He realized, by a considerable feat of intellect,

that the horse must have fallen down; and then, with a dim notion

that nothing mattered, he went to sleep.

211


II
In the boudoir of the magnificent flat on the first floor,

shielded from the noise and the inclemency of the world by four

silk-hung walls and a double window, and surrounded by all the

multitudinous and costly luxury that a stockbroker with brains and

taste can obtain for the wife of his love, May was leisurely

finishing her toilette. And every detail in the long, elaborate

process was accomplished with a passionate intention to bewitch the

man at Winchester House.
These two had first met seven years before, when May, the

daughter of a successful wholesale draper at Hanbridge, in the Five

Towns district of Staffordshire, was aged twenty-two. Mr. Scarratt

went to Manchester each Tuesday to buy, and about once a month he

took May with him. One day, when they were lunching at the Exchange

Restaurant, a young man came up whom her father introduced as Mr.

Edward Norris, his stockbroker. Mr. Norris, whose years were

thirty, glanced keenly at May, and accepted Mr. Scarratt's

invitation to join them. Ever afterwards May vividly remembered

212

the wonderful sensation, joyous yet disconcerting, which she then

experienced—the sensation of having captivated her father's

handsome and correct stockbroker. The three talked horses with a

certain freedom, and since May was accustomed to drive the Scarratt

dogcart, so famous in the Five Towns, she could bring her due share

to the conversation. The meal over, Mr. Norris discussed business

matters with his client, and then sedately departed, but not

without the obviously sincere expression of a desire to meet Miss

Scarratt again. The wholesale draper praised Edward's financial

qualities behind his back, and wondered that a man of such aptitude

should remain in Manchester while London existed. As for May, she

decided that she would have a new frock before she came to

Manchester in the following month.
She had a new frock, but not of the colour intended. By the

following month her father was enclosed in a coffin, and it

happened to his estate, as to the estates of many successful men

who employ stockbrokers, that the liabilities far more than covered

the assets. May and her mother were left without a penny. 213 The

mother did the right thing, and died—it was best. May went

direct to Brunt's, the largest draper in the Five Towns, and asked

for a place under 'Madame' in the dress-making department. Brunt's

daughter, who was about to be married, gave her the place

instantly. Three years later, when 'Madame' returned to Paris, May

stepped into the French-woman's shoes.
On Sundays and on Thursday afternoons, and sometimes (but not

too often) at the theatre, May was the finest walking advertisement

that Brunt's ever had. Old Brunt would have proposed to her, it was

rumoured, had he not been scared by her elegance. Sundry sons of

prosperous manufacturers, unabashed by this elegance, did in fact

secretly propose, but with what result was known only to

themselves.
Later, as May waxed in importance at Brunt's, she was sent to

Manchester to buy. She lunched at the Exchange Restaurant. The

world and Manchester are very small. The first man she set eyes on

was Edward Norris. Another week, Norris said to her with a thrill,

and he would have been gone for ever to 214 London. Chance is

not to be flouted. The sequel was inevitable. They loved. And all

the select private bars in Hanbridge tinkled to the news that May

Scarratt had been and hooked a stockbroker!
When the toilette was done, and the maid gone, she wound a thin

black scarf round her olive neck and shoulders, and sat down

negligently on a Chippendale settee in the attitude of a portrait

by Boldini; her little feet were tucked up sideways on the settee;

the perforated lace ends of the scarf fell over her low corsage to

the level of the seat. And she waited, still the bride. He was

late, but she knew he would be late. Sure in the conviction that he

was a strong man, a man of imagination and of deeds, she could

easily excuse this failing in him, as she did that other habit of

impulsive action in trifles. Nay, more, she found keen pleasure in

excusing it. 'Dear thing!' she reflected, 'he forgets so.'

Therefore she waited, content in enjoying the image in the glass of

her dark face, her small plump person, and her Paris

gown—that dream! She thought with assuaged grief of her

father's tragedy; she would have liked him to see her 215 now,

the jewel in the case—her father and she had understood each

other.
All around, and above and below, she felt, without hearing it,

the activity of the opulent, complex life of the mansions. Her mind

dwelt with satisfaction on long carpeted corridors noiselessly

paraded by flunkeys, mahogany lifts continually ascending and

descending like the angels of the ladder, the great entrance hall

with its fire always burning and its doors always swinging, the

salle à manger sown with rose-shaded candles, and all

the splendid privacies rising stage upon stage to the attics, where

the flunkeys philosophized together. She confessed the beauty and

distinction achieved by this extravagant organization for

gratifying earthly desires. Often, in the pinching days of her

servitude, she had murmured against the injustice of things, and

had called wealth a crime while poverty starved. But now she

perceived that society was what it was inevitably, and could not be

altered. She accepted it in profound peace of mind, gaily fraternal

towards the fortunate, compassionate towards those in

adversity.
In the next flat someone began to play very 
216 brilliantly a

Hungarian Rhapsody of Liszt's. And even the faint sound of that

riotous torrent of melody, so arrogantly gorgeous, intoxicated her

soul. She shivered under the sudden vision of the splendid joy of

being alive. And how she envied the player! French she had learned

from 'Madame,' but she had no skill on the piano; it was her one

regret.
She touched the bell.
'Has your master come in yet?' she inquired of the maid.
'No, madam, not yet.'
She knew he had not come in, but she could not resist the

impulse to ask.
Ten minutes later, when the piano had ceased, she jumped up,

and, creeping to the front-door of the flat, gazed foolishly across

the corridor at the grille of the lift. She heard the lift in

travail. It appeared and passed out of sight above. No, he had not

come! Glancing aside, she saw the tall slender figure of a girl in

a green tea-gown—a mere girl: it was the player of the

Hungarian Rhapsody. And this girl, too, she thought, was expectant

and disappointed! They shut their doors simultaneously, she and

May, who also had her 217 girlish moments.

Then the rhapsody recommenced.
'Oh, madam!' screamed the maid, almost tumbling into the

boudoir.
'What is it?' May demanded with false calm.
The maid lifted the corner of her black apron to her eyes, as

though she had been a stage soubrette in trouble.
'The master, madam! He's fell out of his cab—just in front

of the mansions—and they're bringing him in—such blood

I never did see!'
The maid finished with hysterics.
III
'And them just off their honeymoon!'
The inconsolable tones of the lady's-maid came from the kitchen

to the open door of the bedroom, where May was giving instructions

to the elderly cook.
'Send that girl out of the flat this moment!' May said.
'Yes, ma'am.'
'Make the beef-tea in case it's wanted, and 
218 let me have some

more warm water. There's John and the doctor!'
She started at a knock.
'No, it's only the postman, ma'am.'
Some letters danced on the hall floor and on her nerves.
'Oh dear!' May whispered. 'I thought it was the doctor at

last.'
'John's bound to be back with one in a minute, ma'am. Do bear

up,' urged the cook, hurrying to the kitchen.
She could have destroyed the woman for those last words.
With the proud certainty of being equal to the dreadful crisis,

she turned abruptly into the bedroom, where her husband lay

insensible on one of the new beds. Assisted by the policemen and

the cook, she had done everything that could be done: cut away the

coats and the waistcoat, removed the boots, straightened the limbs,

washed the face and neck—especially the neck—which had

to be sponged continually, and scattered messengers, including

John, over the vicinity in search of medical aid. And now the

policemen had gone, the general emotion on the staircase had

subsided, 219 the front-door of the flat was shut. The great

ocean of the life of the mansions had closed smoothly upon her

little episode. She was alone with the shattered organism.
She bent fondly over the bed, and her Paris frock, and the black

scarf which she had not removed, touched its ruinous burden. Her

right hand directed the sponge with ineffable tenderness, and then

the long thin fingers tightened to a frenzied clutch to squeeze it

over the basin. The whole of her being was absorbed in a deep

passion of pity and an intolerable hunger for the doctor.
Through the wall came once more the faint sound of the Hungarian

Rhapsody, astonishingly rapid and brilliant. She set her teeth to

endure its unconscious message of the vast indifference of life to

death.
The organism stirred, and May watched the deathly face for a

sign. The eyes opened and stared at her in agonized bewilderment.

The lips tried to speak, and failed.
'It's all right, darling,' she said softly. 'You're in your own

bed. The doctor will be here directly. Drink this.'
She gave him some brandy-and-water, and 220 they looked at each

other. He was no longer Edward Norris, the finely regulated

intelligence, the masterful volition, the conqueror of the world

and of a woman; but merely the embodiment of a frightened,

despairing, flickering, hysterical will-to-live, which glanced in

terror at the corners of the room as though it saw fate there. And

beneath her intense solicitude was the instinctive feeling, which

hurt her, but which she could not dismiss, of her measureless,

dominating superiority. With what glad relief would she have

changed places with him!
'I'm dying, May,' he murmured at length, with a sigh. 'Why

doesn't the doctor come?'
'He is coming,' she replied soothingly. 'You'll be better

soon.'
But his effort in speaking obliged her to use the sponge again,

and he saw it, and drew another sigh, more mortal than the

first.
'Oh! I'm dying,' he repeated.
'Not you, Ted!' And her smile cost her an awful pang.
'I am. I know it.' This time he spoke with sad resignation. 'You

must face it. And—listen.'
221 'What, dear?'
A physical sensation of sickness came over her. She could not

disguise from herself the fact that he was dying. The warped and

pallid face, the panic-struck eyes, the sweat, the wound in the

neck, the damp hands nervously pulling the hem of the

sheet—these indications were not to be gainsaid. The truth

was too horrible to grasp; she wanted to put it away from her.

'This calamity cannot happen to me!' she thought urgently, and all

the while she knew that it was happening to her.
He collected the feeble remnant of his powers by an immense

effort, and began to speak, slowly and fragmentarily, and with such

weakness that she could only catch his words by putting her ear to

his mouth. The restless hands dropped the sheet and took the end of

the black scarf.
'You'll be comfortable—for money,' he said. 'Will made....

It's not that. It's ... I must tell you. It's——'
'Yes?' she encouraged him. 'Tell me. I can hear.'
'It's about your father. I didn't treat him 
222 quite right ...

once.... Week after I first met you, May.... No, not quite right.

He was holding Hull and Barnsley shares ... you know, railway ...

great gambling stock, then, Hull and Barn—Barnsley. Holding

them on cover; for the rise.... They dropped too much—dropped

to 23.... He couldn't hold any longer ... wired to me to sell and

cut the loss. Understand?'
'Yes,' she said, trembling. 'I quite understand.'
'Well ... I wired back, "Sold at 23." ... But some mistake.

Shares not sold. Clerk's mistake.... Clerk didn't sell.... Next day

rise began.... I didn't wire him shares not sold. Somehow, I

couldn't.... Put it off.... Rise went on.... I took over shares

myself ... you see—myself.... Made nearly five thousand

clear.... I wanted money then.... I think I would have told him,

perhaps, later ... made it right ... but he died ... sudden ... I

wasn't going to let his creditors have that five thou.... No, he'd

meant to sell ... and, look here, May, if those shares had dropped

lower ... 'stead of rising ... I should have had 
223 to stand the

racket ... with your father, for my clerk's mistake.... See?...

He'd meant to sell.... Hard lines on him, but he'd meant to

sell.... He'd meant——'
'Don't say any more, dear.'
'Must explain this, May. Why didn't I give the money to you ...

when he was dead?... Because I knew you'd only ... give it ... to

creditors.... I knew you.... That's straight.... I've told you

now.'
He lost consciousness again, but for an instant May did not

notice it. She was crying, and her tears fell on his face.
Then came a doctor, a little dark man, who explained with calm

politeness that he had been out when the messenger first arrived.

He took off his coat, hung it up, opened his bag, and proceeded to

a minute examination of the patient. His movements were so

methodical, and he gave orders to May in a tone so quiet, casual,

and ordinary, that she almost lost her sense of the reality of the

scene.
'Yes, yes,' he said, from time to time, as if to himself;

nothing else; not a single enlightening word to May.
224 'I'm dying,' moaned Edward, opening his

eyes.
The doctor glanced round at May and winked. That wink,

deliberate and humorous, was like an electric shock to her. She

could actually feel her heart leap in her breast. If she had not

been afraid of the doctor, she would have fainted.
'You all think you're dying,' the doctor remarked in a low,

amused tone to the ceiling, as he wiped a pair of scissors, 'when

you've been knocked silly, especially if there's a lot of blood

about.'
The door opened.
'Here's John, ma'am,' said the cook, 'with two more doctors.

What am I to do?'
May involuntarily turned towards the door.
'Don't you go, Mrs. Norris,' the little dark man commanded. 'I

want you.' Then he carelessly scrutinized the elderly servant.

'Tell 'em they're too late,' he said. 'It's generally like that

when there's an accident,' he continued after the housekeeper had

gone. 'First you can't get a doctor anywhere, and then in half an

hour or so we come in crowds. I've known seven doctors turn up one

after another. 225 But in that affair the man happened to have

been killed outright.'
He smiled grimly. In a little while he was snapping his bag.
'I'll come in the morning, of course,' he said, as he wrote on a

piece of paper. 'Have this made up, and give it him in the night if

he is wakeful. Keep him warm. You might put a couple of hot-water

bags, one on either side of him. You've got beef-tea made, you say?

That's right. Let him have as much as he wants. Mr. Norris, you'll

sleep like a top.'
'But, doctor,' May inquired the next morning in the hall, after

Edward had smiled at a joke, and been informed that he must run

down to Bournemouth in a week, 'have we nothing to fear?'
'I think not,' was the measured answer. 'These affairs nearly

always seem much worse than they are. Of course, the immediate

upset is tremendous—the disorganization, and all that sort of

thing. But Nature's pretty wonderful. You'll find your husband will

soon get over it. I should say he had a good constitution.'
'And there will be no permanent effects?'
'Yes,' said the doctor, with genial cynicism. 
226 'There'll be one

permanent effect. Nobody will ever persuade him to ride in a hansom

again. If he can't find a four-wheeler, he'll walk in future.'
She returned to the bedroom. The man on the bed was Edward

Norris once more, in control of himself, risen out of his

humiliation. A feeling of thankfulness overwhelmed her for a

moment, and she sat down.
'Well, May?' he murmured.
'Well, dear.'
They both realized that what they had been through was a common,

daily street accident. The smile of each was self-conscious,

apprehensive, insincere.
'Quite a concert going on next door,' he said with an

affectation of lightness.
It was the Hungarian Rhapsody, impetuous and brilliant as ever.

How she hated it now—this symbol of the hurried, unheeding,

relentless, hollow gaiety of the world! Yet she longed for the

magic fingers of the player, that she, too, might smother grief in

such glittering veils!

227


IV
The marriage which had begun so dramatically fell into placid

routine. Edward fulfilled the prophecy of the doctor. In a week

they were able to go to Bournemouth for a few days, and in less

than a fortnight he was at the office—the strong man again,

confident and ambitious.
After days devoted to finance, he came home in the evenings

high-spirited and determined to enjoy himself. His voice was firm

and his eye steady when he spoke to his wife; there was no trace of

self-consciousness in his demeanour. She admired the masculinity of

the brain that could forget by an effort of will. She felt that he

trusted her to forget also; that he relied on her common-sense, her

characteristic sagacity, to extinguish for ever the memory of an

awkward incident. He loved her. He was intensely proud of her. He

treated her with every sort of generosity. And in return he

expected her to behave like a man.
She loved him. She esteemed him as a wife should. She made a

profession of wifehood. 228 He gave his days to

finance and his nights to diversion; but her vocation was always

with her—she was never off duty. She aimed to please him to

the uttermost in everything, to be in all respects the ideal

helpmate of a husband who was at once strenuous, fastidious, and

wealthy. Elegance and suavity were a religion with her. She was the

delight of the eye and of the ear, the soother of groans, the

refuge of distress, the uplifter of the heart.
She made new acquaintances for him, and cemented old

friendships. Her manner towards his old friends enchanted him; but

when they were gone she had a way of making him feel that she was

only his. She thought that she was succeeding in her aim. She

thought that all these sweet, endless labours—of traffic with

dressmakers, milliners, coiffeurs, maids, cooks, and furnishers; of

paying and receiving calls; of delicious surprise journeys to the

City to bring home the breadwinner; of giving and accepting

dinners; of sitting alert and appreciative in theatres and

music-halls; of supping in golden restaurants; of being serious,

cautionary, submissive, and seductive; of smiles, laughter,

229

and kisses; and of continuous sympathetic responsiveness—she

thought that all these labours had attained their object: Edward's

complete serenity and satisfaction. She imagined that love and duty

had combined successfully to deceive him on one solitary point. She

was sure that he was deceived. But she was wrong.
One evening they were at the theatre alone together. It was a

musical comedy, and they had a large stage-box. May sat a little

behind. After having been darkened for a scenic conjuring trick,

the stage was very suddenly thrown into brilliant light. Edward

turned with equal suddenness to share his appreciation of the

effect with his wife, and the light and his eye caught her

unawares. She smiled instantly, but too late; he had seen the

expression of her features. For a second she felt as if the whole

fabric which she had been building for the last six months had

crumbled; but this disturbing idea passed as she recovered

herself.
'Let's go home, eh?' he said, at the end of the first act.
'Yes,' she agreed. 'It would be nice to be in early, wouldn't

it?'
230 In the brougham they exchanged the amiable

banalities of people who are thoroughly intimate. When they reached

the flat, she poured out his whisky-and-potass, and sat on the arm

of his particular arm-chair while he sipped it; then she whispered

that she was going to bed.
'Wait a bit,' he said; 'I want to talk to you seriously.'
'Dear thing!' she murmured, stroking his coat.
She had not the slightest notion of his purpose.
'You've tried your best, May,' he said bluntly, 'but you've

failed. I've suspected it for a long time.'
She flushed, and retired to a sofa, away from the orange

electric lamp.
'What do you mean, Edward?' she asked.
'You know very well what I mean, my dear,' he replied. 'What I

told you—that night! You've tried to forget it. You've tried

to look at me as though you had forgotten it. But you can't do it.

It's on your mind. I've noticed it again and again. I noticed it at

the theatre to-night. So I said 231 to myself, "I'll

have it out with her." And I'm having it out.'
'My dear Ted, I assure you——'
'No, you don't,' he stopped her. 'I wish you did. Now you must

just listen. I know exactly what sort of an idiot I was that night

as well as you do. But I couldn't help it. I was a fool to tell

you. Still, I thought I was dying. I simply had a babbling fit.

People are like that. You thought I was dying, too, didn't

you?'
'Yes,' she said quietly, 'for a minute or two.'
'Ah! It was that minute or two that did it. Well, I let it out,

the rotten little secret. I admit it wasn't on the square, that bit

of business. But, on the other hand, it wasn't anything really

bad—like cruelty to animals or ruining a girl. Of course, the

chap was your father, but, but——. Look here, May, you

ought to be able to see that I was exactly the same man after I

told you as I was before. You ought to be able to see that. My

character wasn't wrecked because I happened to split on myself,

like an ass, about that affair. Mind you, I don't blame you. You

can't help your feelings. But do you suppose there's a single

232

man on this blessed earth without a secret? I'm not going to grovel

before gods or men. I'm not going to pretend I'm so frightfully

sorry. I'm sorry in a way. But can't you see——'
'Don't say any more, Ted,' she begged him, fingering her sash.

'I know all that. I know it all, and everything else you can say.

Oh, my darling boy! do you think I would look down on you ever so

little because of—what you told me? Who am I? I wouldn't care

twopence even if——'
'But it's between us all the same,' he broke in. 'You can't get

over it.'
'Get over it!' she repeated lamely.
'Can you? Have you?' He pinned her to a direct answer.
She did not flinch.
'No,' she said.
'I thought you would have done,' he remarked, half to himself.

'I thought you would. I thought you were enough a woman of the

world for that, May. It isn't as if the confounded thing had made

any real difference to your father. The old man died,

and——'
233 'Ted!' she exclaimed, 'I shall have to tell

you, after all. It killed him.'
'What killed him? He died of gastritis.'
'He was ill with gastritis, but he died of suicide. It's easy

for a gastritis patient to commit suicide. And father did.'
'Why?'
'Oh, ruin, despair! He'd been in difficulties for a long time.

He said that selling those shares just one day too soon was the end

of it. When he saw them going up day after day, it got on his mind.

He said he knew he would never, never have any luck. And then

...'
'You kept it quiet.' He was walking about the room.
'Yes, that was pretty easy.'
'And did your mother know?'
He turned and looked at her.
'Yes, mother knew. It finished her. Oh, Ted!' she burst out, 'if

you'd only telegraphed to him the next morning that the shares

weren't sold, things might have been quite different.'
'You mean I killed your father—and your mother.'
234 'No, I don't,' she cried passionately. 'I tell

you I don't. You didn't know. But I think of it all, sometimes. And

that's why—that's why——'
She sat down again.
'By God, May,' he swore, 'I'm frightfully sorry!'
'I never meant to tell you,' she said, composing herself. 'But,

there! things slip out. Good-night.'
She was gone, but in passing him she had timidly caressed his

shoulder.
'It's all up,' he said to himself. 'This will always be between

us. No one could expect her to forget it.'
V
Gradually her characteristic habits deserted her; she seemed to

lose energy and a part of her interest in those things which had

occupied her most. She changed her dress less frequently, ignoring

dressmakers, and she showed no longer the ravishing elegance of the

bride. She often lay in bed till noon, she who had always entered

the dining-room at 235 nine o'clock precisely to dispense his coffee

and listen to his remarks on the contents of the newspaper. She

said 'As you please' to the cook, and the meals began to lose their

piquancy. She paid no calls, but some of her women friends

continued, nevertheless, to visit her. Lastly, she took to sewing.

The little dark doctor, who had become an acquaintance, smiled at

her and told her to do no more than she felt disposed to do. She

reclined on sofas in shaded rooms, and appeared to meditate. She

was not depressed, but thoughtful. It was as though she had much to

settle in her own mind. At intervals the faint sound of the

Hungarian Rhapsody mingled with her reveries.
As for Edward, his behaviour was immaculate. During the day he

made money furiously. In the evening he sat with his wife. They did

not talk much, and he never questioned her. She developed a certain

curious whimsicality now and then; but for him she could do no

wrong.
The past was not mentioned. They both looked apprehensively

towards the future, towards a crisis which they knew was inexorably

236

approaching. They were afraid, while pretending to have no

fear.
And one afternoon, precipitately, surprisingly, the crisis

came.
'You are the father of a son—a very noisy son,' said the

doctor, coming into the drawing-room where Edward had sat in

torture for three hours.
'And May?'
'Oh, never fear: she's doing excellently.'
'Can I go and see her?' he asked, like a humble petitioner.
'Well—yes,' said the doctor, 'for one minute; not

more.'
So he went into the bedroom as into a church, feeling a fool.

The nurse, miraculously white and starched, stood like a sentinel

at the foot of the bed of mystery.
'All serene, May?' he questioned. If he had attempted to say

another word he would have cried.
The pale mother nodded with a fatigued smile, and by a scarcely

perceptible gesture drew his attention to a bundle. From the next

flat came a faint, familiar sound, insolently joyous.
237 'Yes,' he thought, 'but if they had both been

lying dead here that tune would have been the same.'
Two months later he left the office early, telling his secretary

that he had a headache. It was a mere fibbing excuse. He suffered

from sudden fits of anxiety about his wife and child. When he

reached the flat, he found no one at home but the cook.
'Where's your mistress?' he demanded.
'She's out in the park with baby and nurse, sir.'
'But it's going to rain,' he cried angrily. 'It is raining.

They'll get wet through.'
He rushed into the corridor, and met the procession—May,

the perambulator, and the nursemaid.
'Only fancy, Ted!' May exclaimed, 'the perambulator will go into

the lift, after all. Aren't you glad?'
'Yes,' he said. 'But you're wet, surely?'
'Not a drop. We just got in in time.'
'Sure?'
'Quite.'
The tableau of May, elegant as ever, but her eyes brighter and

her body more leniently 238 curved, of the

hooded perambulator, and of the fluffy-white nursemaid

behind—it was too much for him. Touching clumsily the apron

of the perambulator, the stockbroker turned into his doorway. Just

then the girl from the next flat came out into the corridor,

dressed for social rites of the afternoon. The perambulator was her

excuse for stopping.
'What a pretty boy!' she exclaimed in ecstasy, trying to squeeze

her picture hat under the hood of the perambulator.
'Do you really think so?' said the mother, enchanted.
'Of course! The darling! How I envy you!'
May wanted to reciprocate this politeness.
'I can't tell you,' she said, 'how I envy you your

piano-playing. There's one piece——'
'Envy me! Why! It's only a pianola we've got!'
'Isn't he the picture of his granddad?' said May to Edward when

they bent over the cot that night before retiring.
And as she said it there was such candour in her voice, such

content in her smiling and 239 courageous eyes,

that Edward could not fail to comprehend her message to him. Down

in some very secret part of his soul he felt for the first time the

real force of the great explanatory truth that one generation

succeeds another.

THE SISTERS QITA

The manuscript ran thus:

When I had finished my daily personal examination of the ropes

and trapezes, I hesitated a moment, and then climbed up again, to

the roof, where the red and the blue long ropes were fastened. I

took my sharp scissors from my chatelaine, and gently fretted the

blue rope with one blade of the scissors until only a single strand

was left intact. I gazed down at the vast floor a hundred feet

below. The afternoon varieties were over, and a phrenologist was

talking to a small crowd of gapers in a corner. The rest of the

floor was pretty empty save for the chairs and the fancy stalls,

and the fatigued stall-girls in their black dresses. I too, had

once almost been a stall-girl at the Aquarium! I descended. Few

observed me 244 in my severe street dress. Our secretary,

Charles, attended me on the stage.
'Everything right, Miss Paquita?' he said, handing me my hat and

gloves, which I had given him, to hold.
I nodded. I could see that he thought I was in one of my stern,

far-away moods.
'Miss Mariquita is waiting for you in the carriage,' he

said.
We drove away in silence—I with my inborn melancholy too

sad, Sally (Mariquita) too happy to speak. This daily afternoon

drive was really part of our 'turn'! A team of four mules driven by

a negro will make a sensation even in Regent Street. All London

looked at us, and contrasted our impassive beauty—mine mature

(too mature!) and dark, Sally's so blonde and youthful, our simple

costumes, and the fact that we stayed at an exclusive Mayfair

hotel, with the stupendous flourish of our turnout. The renowned

Sisters Qita—Paquita and Mariquita Qita—and the

renowned mules of the Sisters Qita! Two hundred pounds a week at

the Aquarium! Twenty-five thousand francs for one month at the

Casino de Paris! Twelve thousand five hundred dollars for a tour of

fifty 245 performances in the States! Fifteen hundred

pesos a night and a special train de luxe in Argentina and

Brazil! I could see the loungers and the drivers talking and

pointing as usual. The gilded loungers in Verrey's café got

up and watched us through the windows as we passed. This was fame.

For nearly twenty years I had been intimate with fame, and with the

envy of women and the foolish homage of men.
We saw dozens of omnibuses bearing the legend 'Qita.' Then we

met one which said: 'Empire Theatre. Valdès, the matchless

juggler,' and Sally smiled with pleasure.
'He's coming to see our turn to-night, after his,' she remarked,

blushing.
'Valdès? Why?' I asked, without turning my head.
'He wants us to sup with him, to celebrate our engagement.'
'When do you mean to get married?' I asked her shortly. I felt

quite calm.
'I guess you're a Tartar to-day,' said the pretty thing, with a

touch of her American sauciness. 'We haven't studied it out yet. It

was only yesterday afternoon he kissed me for the first time.' Then

she bent towards me 246 with her characteristic plaintive, wistful

appeal. 'Say! You aren't vexed, Selina, are you, because of this?

Of course, he wants me to tour with him after we're married, and do

a double act. He's got lots of dandy ideas for a double act. But I

won't, I won't, Selina, unless you say the word. Now, don't you go

and be cross, Selina.'
I let myself expand generously.
'My darling girl!' I said, glancing at her kindly. 'You ought to

know me better. Of course I'm not cross. And of course you must

tour with Valdès. I shall be all right. How do you suppose I

managed before I invented you?' I smiled like an indulgent

mother.
'Oh! I didn't mean that,' she said. 'I know you're frightfully

clever. I'm nothing——'
'I hope you'll be awfully happy,' I whispered, squeezing her

hand. 'And don't forget that I introduced him to you—I knew

him years before you did. I'm the cause of this

bliss——Do you remember that cold morning in

Berlin?'
'Oh! well, I should say!' she exclaimed in ecstasy.
When we reached our rooms in the hotel I 247 kissed her warmly.

Women do that sort of thing.
Then a card was brought to me. 'George Capey,' it said; and in

pencil, 'Of the Five Towns.'
I shrugged my shoulders. Sally had gone to scribble a note to

her Valdès. 'Show Mr. Capey in,' I said, and a natty young

man entered, half nervousness, half audacity.
'How did you know I come from the Five Towns?' I questioned

him.
'I am on the Evening Mail,' he said, 'where they know

everything, madam.'
I was annoyed. 'Then they know, on the Evening Mail that

Paquita Qita has never been interviewed, and never will be,' I

said.
'Besides,' he went on, 'I come from the Five Towns myself.'
'Bursley?' I asked mechanically.
'Bursley,' he ejaculated; then added, 'you haven't been near old

Bosley since——'
It was true.
'No,' I said hastily. 'It is many years since I have been in

England, even. Do they know down there who Qita is?'
'Not they!' he replied.
248 I grew reflective. Stars such as I have no

place of origin. We shoot up out of a void, and sink back into a

void. I had forgotten Bursley and Bursley folk. Recollections

rushed in upon me.... I felt beautifully sad. I drew off my gloves,

and flung my hat on a chair with a movement that would have

bewitched a man of the world, but Mr. George Capey was unimpressed.

I laughed.
'What's the joke?' he inquired. I adored him for his

Bursliness.
'I was just thinking, of fat Mrs. Cartledge, who used to keep

that fishmonger's shop in Oldcastle Street, opposite Bates's. I

wonder if she's still there?'
'She is,' he said. 'And fatter than ever! She's getting on in

years now.'
I broke the rule of a lifetime, and let him interview me.
'Tell them I'm thirty-seven,' I said. 'Yes, I mean it. Tell

them.'
And then for another tit-bit I explained to him how I had

discovered Sally at Koster and Bial's, in New York, five years ago,

and made her my sister for stage purposes because I was lonely, and

liked her American simplicity and 249 twang. He departed

full of tea and satisfaction.

It was our last night at the Aquarium. The place was crammed.

The houses where I performed were always crammed. Our turn was in

three parts, and lasted half an hour. The first part was a skirt

dance in full afternoon dress (danse de modernité, I

called it); the second was a double horizontal bar act; the third

was the famous act of the red and the blue ropes, in full evening

dress. It was 10.45 when we climbed the silk ladders for the third

part. High up in the roof, separated from each other by nearly the

length of the great hall, Sally and I stood on two little

platforms. I held the ends of the red and the blue ropes. I had to

let the blue rope swing across the hall to her. She would seize it,

and, clutching it, swoop like the ball of an enormous pendulum from

her platform to mine. (But would she?) I should then swing on the

red rope to the platform she had left.
Then the band would stop for the thrilling moment, and the

lights would be lowered. Each lighting and holding a powerful

electric 250 hand-light—one red, one blue—we

should signal the drummer and plunge simultaneously into space,

flash past each other in mid-flight, exchanging lights as we passed

(this was the trick), and soar to opposite platforms again, amid

frenzied applause. There were no nets.
That was what ought to occur.
I stood bowing to the floor of tiny upturned heads, and jerking

the ropes a little. Then I let Sally's rope go with a push, and it

dropped away from me, and in a few seconds she had it safe in her

strong hand. She was taller than me, with a fuller figure, yet she

looked quite small on her distant platform. All the evening I had

been thinking of fat old Mrs. Cartledge messing and slopping among

cod and halibut on white tiles. I could not get Bursley and my

silly infancy out of my head. I followed my feverish career from

the age of fifteen, when that strange Something in me, which makes

an artist, had first driven me forth to conquer two continents. I

thought of all the golden loves I had scorned, and my own love,

which had been ignored, unnoticed, but which still obstinately

burned. I glanced downwards and descried Valdès precisely

where Sally had 251 said he would be. Valdès, what a fool

you were! And I hated a fool. I am one of those who can love and

hate, who can love and despise, who can love and loathe the same

object in the same moment. Then I signalled to Sally to plunge, and

my eyes filled with tears. For, you see, somehow, in some senseless

sentimental way, the thought of fat Mrs. Cartledge and my silly

infancy had forced me to send Sally the red rope, not the blue one.

We exchanged ropes on alternate nights, but this was her night for

the blue one.
She swung over, alighting accurately at my side with that

exquisite outward curve of the spine which had originally attracted

me to her.
'You sent me the red one,' she said to me, after she had

acknowledged the applause.
'Yes,' I said. 'Never mind; stick to it now you've got it.

Here's the red light. Have you seen Valdès?'
She nodded.
I took the blue light and clutched the blue rope. Instead of

murder—suicide, since it must be one or the other. And why

not? Indeed, I censured myself in that second for having 252 meant

to kill Sally. Not because I was ashamed of the sin, but because

the revenge would have been so pitiful and weak. If Valdès

the matchless was capable of passing me over and kneeling to the

pretty thing——
I stood ready. The world was to lose that fineness, that

distinction, that originality, that disturbing subtlety, which

constituted Paquita Qita. I plunged.
... I was on the other platform. The rope had held, then: I

remembered nothing of the flight except that I had passed near the

upturned, pleasant face of Valdès.
The band stopped. The lights of the hall were lowered. All was

dark. I switched on my dazzling blue light; Sally switched on her

red one. I stood ready. The rope could not possibly endure a second

strain. I waved to Sally and signalled to the conductor. The world

was to lose Paquita. The drum began its formidable roll. Whirrr! I

plunged, and saw the red star rushing towards me. I snatched it and

soared upwards. The blue rope seemed to tremble. As I came near the

platform at decreasing speed, it seemed to stretch like elastic. It

broke! The platform 253 jumped up suddenly over my head, but I caught

at the silk ladder. I was saved! There was a fearful silence, and

then the appalling shock of hysterical applause from seven thousand

throats. I slid down the ladder, ran across the stage into my

dressing-room for a cloak, out again into the street. In two days I

was in Buda-Pesth.


257


NOCTURNE AT THE MAJESTIC

I
In the daily strenuous life of a great hotel there are periods

during which its bewildering activities slacken, and the vast

organism seems to be under the influence of an opiate. Such a

period recurs after dinner when the guests are preoccupied by the

mysterious processes of digestion in the drawing-rooms or

smoking-rooms or in the stalls of a theatre. On the evening of this

nocturne the well-known circular entrance-hall of the Majestic,

with its tessellated pavement, its malachite pillars, its Persian

rugs, its lounges, and its renowned stuffed bears at the foot of

the grand stairway, was for the moment deserted, save by the head

hall-porter and the head night-porter and the girl in the bureau.

It was a quarter to nine, and the head hall-porter was abdicating

his 258 pagoda to the head night-porter, and telling

him the necessary secrets of the day. These two lords, before whom

the motley panorama of human existence was continually being

enrolled, held a portentous confabulation night and morning. They

had no illusions; they knew life. Shakespeare himself might have

listened to them with advantage.
The girl in the bureau, like a beautiful and languishing animal

in its cage, leaned against her window, and looked between two

pillars at the magnificent lords. She was too far off to catch

their talk, and, indeed, she watched them absently in a reverie

induced by the sweet melancholy of the summer twilight, by the

torpidity of the hour, and by the prospect of the next day, which

was her day off. The liveried functionaries ignored her, probably

scorned her as a mere pretty little morsel. Nevertheless, she was

the centre of energy, not they. If money were payable, she was the

person to receive it; if a customer wanted a room, she would choose

it; and the lords had to call her 'miss.' The immense and splendid

hotel pulsed round this simple heart hidden under a white blouse.

Especially in summer, 259 her presence and the

presence of her companions in the bureau (but to-night she was

alone) ministered to the satisfaction of male guests, whose cruel

but profoundly human instincts found pleasure in the fact that, no

matter when they came in from their wanderings, the pretty captives

were always there in the bureau, smiling welcome, puzzling stupid

little brains and puckering pale brows over enormous ledgers,

twittering borrowed facetiousness from rosy mouths, and smoothing

out seductive toilettes with long thin hands that were made for

ring and bracelet and rudder-lines, and not a bit for the pen and

the ruler.
The pretty little thing despised of the functionaries

corresponded almost exactly in appearance to the typical bureau

girl. She was moderately tall; she had a good slim figure, all

pleasant curves, flaxen hair and plenty of it, and a dainty, rather

expressionless face; the ears and mouth were very small, the eyes

large and blue, the nose so-so, the cheeks and forehead of an equal

ivory pallor, the chin trifling, with a crease under the lower lip

and a rich convexity springing out from below the crease. The

extremities of the full lips were 260 nearly always drawn

up in a smile, mechanical, but infallibly attractive. The hair was

of an orthodox frizziness. You would have said she was a nice,

kind, good-natured girl, flirtatious but correct, well adapted to

adorn a dogcart on Sundays.
This was Nina, foolish Nina, aged twenty-one. In her reverie the

entire Hôtel Majestic weighed on her; she had a more than

adequate sense of her own solitary importance in the bureau, and

stirring obscurely beneath that consciousness were the deep

ineradicable longings of a poor pretty girl for heaps of money,

endless luxury of finery and chocolates, and sentimental silken

dalliance.
Suddenly a stranger entered the hall. His advent seemed to wake

the place out of the trance into which it had fallen. The nocturne

had begun. Nina straightened herself and intensified her eternal

smile. The two porters became military, and smiled with a special

and peculiar urbanity. Several lesser but still lordly

functionaries appeared among the pillars; a page-boy emerged by

magic from the region of the chimney-piece like Mephistopheles in

Faust's study; and some guests of both sexes 261 strolled chattering

across the tessellated pavement as they passed from one wing of the

hotel to the other.
'How do, Tom?' said the stranger, grasping the hand of the head

hall-porter, and nodding to the head night-porter.
His voice showed that he was an American, and his demeanour that

he was one of those experienced, wealthy, and kindly travellers who

know the Christian names of all the hall-porters in the world, and

have the trick of securing their intimacy and fealty. He wore a

blue suit and a light gray wideawake, and his fine moustache was

grizzled. In his left hand he carried a brown bag.
'Nicely, thank you, sir,' Tom replied. 'How are you, sir?'
'Oh, about six and six.'
Whereupon both porters laughed heartily.
Tom escorted him to the bureau, and tried to relieve him of his

bag. Inferior lords escorted Tom.
'I guess I'll keep the grip,' said the stranger. 'Mr. Pank will

be around with some more baggage pretty soon. We've expressed the

rest on to the steamer. Well, my dear,' he went 
262 on, turning to

Nina, 'you're a fresh face here.'
He looked her steadily in the eyes.
'Yes, I am,' she said, conquered instantly.
Radiant and triumphant, the man brought good-humour into every

face, like some wonderful combination of the sun and the

sea-breeze.
'Give me two bedrooms and a parlour, please,' he commanded.
'First floor?' asked Nina prettily.
'First floor! Well—I should say! And on the Strand,

my dear.'
She bent over her ledgers, blushing.
'Send someone to the 'phone, Tom, and let 'em put me on to the

Regency, will you?' said the stranger.
'Yes, sir. Samuels, go and ring up the Regency

Theatre—quick!'
Swift departure of a lord.
'And ask Alphonse to come up to my bedroom in ten minutes from

now,' the stranger proceeded to Tom. 'I shall want a dandy supper

for fourteen at a quarter after eleven.'
'Yes, sir. No dinner, sir?'
263 'No; we dined on the Pullman. Well, my dear,

figured it out yet?'
'Numbers 102, 120, and 107,' said Nina.
'Keys 102, 120, and 107,' said Tom.
Swift departure of another lord to the pagoda.
'How much?' demanded the stranger.
'The bedrooms are twenty-five shillings, and the sitting-room

two guineas.'
'I guess Mr. Pank won't mind that. Hullo, Pank, you're here! I'm

through. Your number's 102 or 120, which you fancy. Just going to

the 'phone a minute, and then I'll join you upstairs.'
Mr. Pank was a younger man, possessing a thin, astute,

intellectual face. He walked into the hall with noticeable

deliberation. His travelling costume was faultless, but from

beneath his straw hat his black hair sprouted in a somewhat

peculiar fashion over his broad forehead. He smiled lazily and

shrewdly, and without a word disappeared into a lift. Two large

portmanteaus accompanied him.
Presently the elder stranger could be heard battling with the

obstinate idiosyncrasies of a London telephone.
264 'You haven't registered,' Nina called to him

in her tremulous, delicate, captivating voice, as he came out of

the telephone-box.
He advanced to sign, and, taking a pen and leaning on the front

of the bureau, wrote in the visitor's book, in a careful, legible

hand: 'Lionel Belmont, New York.' Having thus written, and still

resting on the right elbow, he raised his right hand a little and

waved the pen like a delicious menace at Nina.
'Mr. Pank hasn't registered, either,' he said slowly, with a

charming affectation of solemnity, as though accusing Mr. Pank of

some appalling crime.
Nina laughed timidly as she pushed his room-ticket across the

page of the big book. She thought that Mr. Lionel Belmont was

perfectly delightful.
'No,' he hasn't,' she said, trying also to be arch; 'but he

must.'
At that moment she happened to glance at the right hand of Mr.

Belmont. In the brilliance of the electric light she could see the

fair skin of the wrist and forearm within the whiteness of his

shirt-sleeve. She stared at what she saw, every muscle tense.
265 'I guess you can round up Mr. Pank yourself,

my dear, later on,' said Lionel Belmont, and turned quickly away,

intent on the next thing.
He did not notice that her large eyes had grown larger and her

pale face paler. In another moment the hall was deserted again. Mr.

Belmont had ascended in the lift, Tom had gone to his rest, and the

head night-porter was concealed in the pagoda. Nina sank down

limply on her stool, her nostrils twitching; she feared she was

about to faint, but this final calamity did not occur. She had,

nevertheless, experienced the greatest shock of her brief life, and

the way of it was thus.
II
Nina Malpas was born amid the embers of one of those fiery

conjugal dramas which occur with romantic frequency in the

provincial towns of the northern Midlands, where industrial

conditions are such as to foster an independent spirit among women

of the lower class generally, and where by long tradition

'character' is allowed to exploit itself more 266 freely than in the

southern parts of our island. Lemuel Malpas was a dashing young

commercial traveller, with what is known as 'an agreeable address,'

in Bursley, one of the Five Towns, Staffordshire. On the strength

of his dash he wooed and married the daughter of an hotel-keeper in

the neighbouring town of Hanbridge. Six months after the

wedding—in other words, at the most dangerous period of the

connubial career—Mrs. Malpas's father died, and Mrs. Malpas

became the absolute mistress of eight thousand pounds.

Lemuel[1] had carefully foreseen this

windfall, and wished to use the money in enterprises of the

earthenware trade. Mrs. Malpas, pretty and vivacious, with a

self-conceit hardened by the adulation of saloon-bars, very

decidedly thought otherwise. Her motto was, 'What's yours is mine,

but what's mine's my own.' The difference was accentuated. Long

mutual resistances were followed by reconciliations, which grew

more and more transitory, and at length both recognised that the

union, not founded on genuine affection, had been a mistake.

[1] This name is pronounced with the accent on

the first syllable in the Five Towns.

267

'Keep your d——d brass!' Lemuel exclaimed one

morning, and he went off on a journey and forgot to come back. A

curious letter dated from Liverpool wished his wife happiness, and

informed her that, since she was well provided for, he had no

scruples about leaving her. Mrs. Malpas was startled at first, but

she soon perceived that what Lemuel had done was exactly what the

brilliant and enterprising Lemuel might have been expected to do.

She jerked up her doll's head, and ejaculated, 'So much the

better!'
A few weeks later she sold the furniture and took rooms in

Scarborough, where, amid pleasurable surroundings, she determined

to lead the joyous life of a grass-widow, free of all cares. Then,

to her astonishment and disgust, Nina was born. She had not

bargained for Nina. She found herself in the tiresome position of a

mother whose explanations of her child lack plausibility. One

lodging-housekeeper to whom she hazarded the statement that Lemuel

was in Australia had saucily replied: 'I thought maybe it was the

North Pole he was gone to!'
This decided Mrs. Malpas. She returned 268 suddenly to the Five

Towns, where at least her reputation was secure. Only a week

previously Lemuel had learnt indirectly that she had left their

native district. He determined thenceforward to forget her

completely. Mrs. Malpas's prettiness was of the fleeting sort.

After Nina's birth she began to get stout and coarse, and the

nostalgia of the saloon-bar, the coffee-room, and the sanded

portico overtook her. The Tiger at Bursley was for sale, a

respectable commercial hotel, the best in the town. She purchased

it, wines, omnibus connection, and all, and developed into the

typical landlady in black silk and gold rings.
In the Tiger Nina was brought up. She was a pretty child from

her earliest years, and received the caresses of all as a matter of

course. She went to a good school, studied the piano, and learnt

dancing, and at sixteen did her hair up. She did as she was told

without fuss, being apparently of a lethargic temperament; she had

all the money and all the clothes that her heart could desire; she

was happy, and in a quiet way she deemed herself a rather

considerable item in the world. When she was eighteen her mother

died miserably of cancer, 269 and it was

discovered that the liabilities of Mrs. Malpas's estate exceeded

its assets—and the Tiger mortgaged up to its value! The

creditors were not angry; they attributed the state of affairs to

illness and the absence of male control, and good-humouredly

accepted what they could get. None the less, Nina, the child of

luxury and sloth, had to start life with several hundreds of pounds

less than nothing. Of her father all trace had been long since

lost. A place was found for her, and for over two years she saw the

world from the office of a famous hotel in Doncaster. Her lethargy,

and an invaluable gift of adapting herself to circumstances, saved

her from any acute unhappiness in the Yorkshire town. Instinctively

she ceased to remember the Tiger and past splendours. (Equally, if

she had married a Duke instead of becoming a book-keeper, she would

have ceased to remember the Tiger and past humility.) Then by good

or ill fortune she had the offer of a situation at the Hôtel

Majestic, Strand, London. The Majestic and the sights thereof woke

up the sleeping soul.
Before her death Mrs. Malpas had told Nina many things about the

vanished Lemuel; 270 among others, the curious detail that he had

two small moles—one hairless, the other hirsute—close

together on the under side of his right wrist. Nina had seen

precisely such marks of identification on the right wrist of Mr.

Lionel Belmont.
She was convinced that Lionel Belmont was her father. There

could not be two men in the world so stamped by nature. She

perceived that in changing his name he had chosen Lionel because of

its similarity to Lemuel. She felt certain, too, that she had

noticed vestiges of the Five Towns accent beneath his Americanisms.

But apart from these reasons, she knew by a superrational instinct

that Lionel Belmont was her father; it was not the call of blood,

but the positiveness of a woman asserting that a thing is so

because she is sure it is so.
III
Nina was not of an imaginative disposition. The romance of this

extraordinary encounter made no appeal to her. She was the sort of

girl that constantly reads novelettes, and yet always, with

fatigued scorn, refers to them as 271 'silly.' Stupid

little Nina was intensely practical at heart, and it was the

practical side of her father's reappearance that engaged her

birdlike mind. She did not stop to reflect that truth is stranger

than fiction. Her tiny heart was not agitated by any ecstatic

ponderings upon the wonder and mystery of fate. She did not feel

strangely drawn towards Lionel Belmont, nor did she feel that he

supplied a something which had always been wanting to her.
On the other hand, her pride—and Nina was very

proud—found much satisfaction in the fact that her father,

having turned up, was so fine, handsome, dashing, good-humoured,

and wealthy. It was well, and excellently well, and delicious, to

have a father like that. The possession of such a father opened up

vistas of a future so enticing and glorious that her present career

became instantly loathsome to her.
It suddenly seemed impossible that she could have tolerated the

existence of a hotel clerk for a single week. Her eyes were opened,

and she saw, as many women have seen, that luxury was an absolute

necessity to her. All her ideas soared with the magic swiftness of

the bean-stalk. 272 And at the same time she was terribly afraid,

unaccountably afraid, to confront Mr. Belmont and tell him that she

was his Nina; he was entirely unaware that he had a Nina.
'I'm your daughter! I know by your moles!'
She whispered the words in her tiny heart, and felt sure that

she could never find courage to say them aloud to that great and

important man. The announcement would be too monstrous, incredible,

and absurd. People would laugh. He would laugh. And Nina could

stand anything better than being laughed at. Even supposing she

proved to him his paternity—she thought of the horridness of

going to lawyers' offices—he might decline to recognise her.

Or he might throw her fifty pounds a year, as one throws sixpence

to an importunate crossing-sweeper, to be rid of her. The United

States existed in her mind chiefly as a country of

highly-remarkable divorce laws, and she thought that Mr. Belmont

might have married again. A fashionable and arrogant Mrs. Belmont,

and a dazzling Miss Belmont, aged possibly eighteen, might arrive,

both of them 273 steeped in all conceivable luxury, at any

moment. Where would Nina be then, with her

two-and-eleven-pence-halfpenny blouse from Glave's?...
Mr. Belmont, accompanied by Alphonse, the head-waiter in the

salle à manger, descended in the lift and crossed the

hall to the portico, where he stood talking for a few seconds. Mr.

Belmont turned, and, as he conversed with Alphonse, gazed absently

in the direction of the bureau. He looked straight through the

pretty captive. After all, despite his superficial heartiness, she

could be nothing to him—so rich, assertive, and truly

important. A hansom was called for him, and he departed; she

observed that he was in evening dress now.
No! Her cause was just; but it was too startling—that was

what was the matter with it.
Then she told herself she would write to Lionel Belmont. She

would write a letter that night.
At nine-thirty she was off duty. She went upstairs to her perch

in the roof, and sat on her bed for over two hours. Then she came

274

down again to the bureau with some bluish note-paper and envelopes

in her hand, and, in response to the surprised question of the

pink-frocked colleague who had taken her place, she explained that

she wanted to write a letter.
'You do look that bad, Miss Malpas,' said the other girl, who

made a speciality of compassion.
'Do I?' said Nina.
'Yes, you do. What have you got on, now, my poor

dear?'
'What's that to you? I'll thank you to mind your own business,

Miss Bella Perkins.'
Usually Nina was not soon ruffled; but that night all her nerves

were exasperated and exceedingly sensitive.
'Oh!' said the girl. 'What price the Duchess of Doncaster? And I

was just going to wish you a nice day to-morrow for your holiday,

too.'
Nina seated herself at the table to write the letter. An

electric light burned directly over her frizzy head. She wrote a

weak but legible and regular back-hand. She hated writing letters,

partly because she was dubious about 275 her spelling, and

partly because of an obscure but irrepressible suspicion that her

letters were of necessity silly. She pondered for a long time, and

then wrote: 'Dear Mr. Belmont,—I venture——' She

made a new start: 'Dear Sir,—I hope you will not think

me——' And a third attempt: 'My dear

Father——' No! it was preposterous. It could no more be

written than it could be said.
The situation was too much for simple Nina.
Suddenly the grand circular hall of the Majestic was filled with

a clamour at once charming and fantastic. There was chattering of

musical, gay American voices, pattering of elegant feet on the

tessellated pavement, the unique incomparable sound of the

frou-frou of many frocks; and above all this the rich tones

of Mr. Lionel Belmont. Nina looked up and saw her radiant father

the centre of a group of girls all young, all beautiful, all

stylish, all with picture hats, all self-possessed, all sparkling,

doubtless the recipients of the dandy supper.
Oh, how insignificant and homicidal Nina felt!
'Thirteen of you!' exclaimed Lionel Belmont, 
276 pulling his

superb moustache. 'Two to a hansom. I guess I'll want six and a

half hansoms, boy.'
There was an explosion of delicious laughter, and the page-boy

grinned, ran off, and began whistling in the portico like a vexed

locomotive. The thirteen fair, shepherded by Lionel Belmont, passed

out into the murmurous summer night of the Strand. Cab after cab

drove up, and Nina saw that her father, after filling each cab,

paid each cabman. In three minutes the dream-like scene was over.

Mr. Belmont re-entered the hotel, winked humorously at the occupant

of the pagoda, ignored the bureau, and departed to his rooms.
Nina ripped her inchoate letters into small pieces, and, with a

tart good-night to Miss Bella Perkins, who was closing her ledgers,

the hour being close upon twelve-thirty, she passed sedately,

stiffly, as though in performance of some vestal's ritual, up the

grand staircase. Turning to the right at the first landing, she

traversed a long corridor which was no part of the route to her

cubicle on the ninth floor. This corridor was lighted by glowing

sparks, which hung on yellow cords from the central 277 line of

the ceiling; underfoot was a heavy but narrow crimson patterned

carpet with a strip of polished oak parquet on either side of it.

Exactly along the central line of the carpet Nina tripped,

languorously, like an automaton, and exactly over her head

glittered the line of electric sparks. The corridor and the journey

seemed to be interminable, and Nina on some inscrutable and mystic

errand. At length she moved aside from the religious line, went

into a service cabinet, and emerged with a small bunch of

pass-keys. No. 107 was Lionel Belmont's sitting-room; No. 102, his

bedroom, was opposite to 107. No. 108, another sitting-room, was,

as Nina knew, unoccupied. She noiselessly let herself into No. 108,

closed the door, and stood still. After a minute she switched on

the light. These two rooms, Nos. 108 and 107, had once

communicated, but, as space grew precious with the growing success

of the Majestic, they had been finally separated, and the door

between them locked and masked by furniture. By reason of the door,

Nina could hear Lionel Belmont moving to and fro in No. 107. She

listened a long time. Then, involuntarily, she yawned with

fatigue.
278 'How silly of me to be here!' she thought.

'What good will this do me?'
She extinguished the light and opened the door to leave. At the

same instant the door of No. 107, three feet off, opened. She drew

back with a start of horror. Suppose she had collided with her

father on the landing! Timorously she peeped out, and saw Lionel

Belmont, in his shirt-sleeves, disappear round the corner.
'He is going to talk with his friend Mr. Pank,' Nina thought,

knowing that No. 120 lay at some little distance round that

corner.
Mr. Belmont had left the door of No. 107 slightly ajar. An

unseen and terrifying force compelled Nina to venture into the

corridor, and then to push the door of No. 107 wide open. The same

force, not at all herself, quite beyond herself, seemed to impel

her by the shoulders into the room. As she stood unmistakably

within her father's private sitting-room, scared, breathing

rapidly, inquisitive, she said to herself:
'I shall hear him coming back, and I can run out before he turns

the corner of the corridor.' And she kept her little pink ears

alert.
279 She looked about the softly brilliant room,

such an extravagant triumph of luxurious comfort as twenty years

ago would have aroused comment even in Mayfair; but there were

scores of similar rooms in the Majestic. No one thought twice of

them. Her father's dress-coat was thrown arrogantly over a Louis

Quatorze chair, and this careless flinging of the expensive shining

coat across the gilded chair somehow gave Nina a more intimate

appreciation of her father's grandeur and of the great and glorious

life he led. She longed to recline indolently in a priceless

tea-gown on the couch by the fireplace and issue orders.... She

approached the writing-table, littered with papers, documents, in

scores and hundreds. To the left was the brown bag. It was locked,

and very heavy, she thought. To the right was a pile of telegrams.

She picked up one, and read:

'Pank, Grand Hotel, Birmingham. Why not burgle hotel?

Simplest most effective plan and solves all

difficulties.—BELMONT.'

She read it twice, crunched it in her left hand, and picked up

another one:

280

'Pank, Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool. Your objection absurd. See

safe in bureau at Majestic. Quite easy. Scene with girl second

evening.—BELMONT.'

The thing flashed blindingly upon her. Her father and Mr. Pank

belonged to the swell mob of which she had heard and seen so much

at Doncaster. She at once became the excessively knowing and

suspicious hotel employé, to whom every stranger is a rogue

until he has proved the contrary. Had she lived through three St.

Leger weeks for nothing? At the hotel at Doncaster, what they

didn't know about thieves and sharpers was not knowledge. The

landlord kept a loaded revolver in his desk there during the week.

And she herself had been provided with a whistle which she was to

blow at the slightest sign of a row; she had blown it once, and

seven policemen had appeared within thirty seconds. The landlord

used to tell tales of masterly and huge scoundrelism that would

make Charles Peace turn in his grave. And the landlord had ever

insisted that no one, no one at all, could always distinguish with

certainty between a real gent and a swell-mobsman.
281 So her father and Mr. Pank had deceived

everyone in the hotel except herself, and they meant to rob the

safe in the bureau to-morrow night. Of course Mr. Lionel Belmont

was a villain, or he would not have deserted her poor dear mother;

it was annoying, but indubitable.... Even now he was maturing his

plans round the corner with that Mr. Pank.... Burglars always went

about in shirt-sleeves.... The brown bag contained the

tools....
The shock was frightful, disastrous, tragic; but it had solved

the situation by destroying it. Practically, Nina no longer had a

father. He had existed for about four hours as a magnificent

reality, full of possibilities; he now ceased to be

recognisable.
She was about to pick up a third telegram when a slight noise

caused her to turn swiftly; she had forgotten to keep her little

pink ears alert. Her father stood in the doorway. He was certainly

the victim of some extraordinary emotion; his face worked; he

seemed at a loss what to do or say; he seemed pained, confused,

even astounded. Simple, foolish Nina had upset the balance of his

equations.
Then he resumed his self-control and came 282 forward into the

room with a smile intended to be airy. Meanwhile Nina had not

moved. One is inclined to pity the artless and defenceless girl in

this midnight duel of wits with a shrewd, resourceful, and

unscrupulous man of the world. But one's pity should not be

lavished on an undeserving object. Though Nina trembled, she was

mistress of herself. She knew just where she was, and just how to

behave. She was as impregnable as Gibraltar.
'Well,' said Mr. Lionel Belmont, genially gazing at her pose,

'you do put snap into it, any way.'
'Into what?' she was about to inquire, but prudently she held

her tongue. Drawing, herself up with the gesture of an offended and

unapproachable queen, the little thing sailed past him, close past

her own father, and so out of the room.
'Say!' she heard him remark: 'let's straighten this thing out,

eh?'
But she heroically ignored him, thinking the while that, with

all his sins, he was attractive enough. She still held the first

telegram in her long, thin fingers.
So ended the nocturne.

283


IV
At five o'clock the next morning Nina's trifling nose was

pressed against the windowpane of her cubicle. In the enormous

slate roof of the Majestic are three rows of round windows, like

port-holes. Out of the highest one, at the extremity of the left

wing, Nina looked. From thence she could see five other vast

hotels, and the yard of Charing Cross Station, with three

night-cabs drawn up to the kerb, and a red van of W.H. Smith and

Son disappearing into the station. The Strand was quite empty. It

was a strange world of sleep and grayness and disillusion. Within a

couple of hundred yards or so of her thousands of people lay

asleep, and they would all soon wake into the disillusion, and the

Strand would wake, and the first omnibus of all the omnibuses would

come along....
Never had simple Nina felt so sad and weary. She was determined

to give up her father. She was bound to tell the manager of her

discovery, for Nina was an honest servant, and she was piqued in

her honesty. No one should know that Lionel Belmont was her

father.... 284 She saw before her the task of forgetting him

and forgetting the rich dreams of which he had been the origin. She

was once more a book-keeper with no prospects.
At eight she saw the manager in the managerial room. Mr. Reuben

was a young Jew, aged about thirty-four, with a cold but

indestructibly polite manner. He was a great man, and knew it; he

had almost invented the Majestic.
She told him her news; it was impossible for foolish Nina to

conceal her righteousness and her sense of her importance.
'Whom did you say, Miss Malpas?' asked Mr. Reuben.
'Mr. Lionel Belmont—at least, that's what he calls

himself.'
'Calls himself, Miss Malpas?'
'Here's one of the telegrams.'
Mr. Reuben read it, looked at little Nina, and smiled; he never

laughed.
'Is it possible, Miss Malpas,' said he, 'that you don't know who

Mr. Belmont and Mr. Pank are?' And then, as she shook her head, he

continued in his impassive, precise way: 'Mr. Belmont is one of the

principal theatrical 285 managers in the

United States. Mr. Pank is one of the principal playwrights in the

United States. Mr. Pank's melodrama 'Nebraska' is now being played

at the Regency by Mr. Belmont's own American company. Another of

Mr. Belmont's companies starts shortly for a tour in the provinces

with the musical comedy 'The Dolmenico Doll.' I believe that Mr.

Pank and Mr. Belmont are now writing a new melodrama, and as they

have both been travelling, but not together, I expect that these

telegrams relate to that melodrama. Did you suppose that

safe-burglars wire their plans to each other like this?' He waved

the telegram with a gesture of fatigue.
Silly, ruined Nina made no answer.
'Do you ever read the papers—the Telegraph or the

Mail, Miss Malpas?'
'N-no, sir.'
'You ought to, then you wouldn't be so ignorant and silly. A

hotel-clerk can't know too much. And, by-the-way, what were you

doing in Mr. Belmont's room last night, when you found these

wonderful telegrams?'
'I went there—I went there—to——'
'Don't cry, please, it won't help you. You 286 must leave here

to-day. You've been here three weeks, I think. I'll tell Mr. Smith

to pay you your month's wages. You don't know enough for the

Majestic, Miss Malpas. Or perhaps you know too much. I'm sorry. I

had thought you would suit us. Keep straight, that's all I have to

say to you. Go back to Doncaster, or wherever it is you came from.

Leave before five o'clock. That will do.'
With a godlike air, Mr. Reuben swung round his office-chair and

faced his desk. He tried not to perceive that there was a

mysterious quality about this case which he had not quite

understood. Nina tripped piteously out.
In the whole of London Nina had one acquaintance, and an hour or

so later, after drinking some tea, she set forth to visit this

acquaintance. The weight of her own foolishness, fatuity,

silliness, and ignorance was heavy upon her. And, moreover, she had

been told that Mr. Lionel Belmont had already departed back to

America, his luggage being marked for the American Transport

Line.
She was primly walking, the superlative of the miserable, past

the façade of the hotel, 287 when someone sprang

out of a cab and spoke to her. And it was Mr. Lionel Belmont.
'Get right into this hansom, Miss Malpas,' he said kindly, 'and

I guess we'll talk it out.'
'Talk what out?' she thought.
But she got in.
'Marble Arch, and go up Regent Street, and don't hurry,' said

Mr. Belmont to the cabman.
'How did he know my name?' she asked herself.
'A hansom's the most private place in London,' he said after a

pause.
It certainly did seem to her very cosy and private, and her

nearness to one of the principal theatrical managers in America was

almost startling. Her white frock, with the black velvet

decorations, touched his gray suit.
'Now,' he said, 'I do wish you'd tell me why you were in my

parlour last night. Honest.'
'What for?' she parried, to gain time.
Should she begin to disclose her identity?
'Because—well, because—oh, look here, 288 my

girl, I want to be on very peculiar terms with you. I want to

straighten out everything. You'll be sort of struck, but I'll be

bound to tell you I'm your father. Now, don't faint or

anything.'
'Oh, I knew that!' she gasped. 'I saw the moles on your wrist

when your were registering—mother told me about them. Oh, if

I had only known you knew!'
They looked at one another.
'It was only the day before yesterday I found out I possessed

such a thing as a daughter. I had a kind of fancy to go around to

the old spot. This notion of me having a daughter struck me

considerable, and I concluded to trace her and size her up at

once.' Nina was bound to smile. 'So your poor mother's been dead

three years?'
'Yes,' said Nina.
'Ah! don't let us talk about that. I feel I can't say just the

right thing.... And so you knew me by those pips.' He pulled up his

right sleeve. 'Was that why you came up to my parlour?'
Nina nodded, and Lionel Belmont sighed with relief.
289 'Why didn't you tell me at once, my dear, who

you where?'
'I didn't dare,' she smiled; 'I was afraid. I thought you

wouldn't——'
'Listen,' he said; 'I've wanted someone like you for years,

years, and years. I've got no one to look after——'
'Then why didn't you tell me at once who you

were?' she questioned with adorable pertness.
'Oh!' he laughed; 'how could I—plump like that? When I saw

you first, in the bureau, the stricken image of your mother at your

age, I was nearly down. But I came up all right, didn't I, my dear?

I acted it out well, didn't I?'

The hansom was rolling through Hyde Park, and the sunshiny hour

was eleven in June. Nina looked forth on the gay and brilliant

scene: rhododendrons, duchesses, horses, dandies—the

incomparable wealth and splendour of the capital. She took a long

breath, and began to be happy for the rest of her life. She felt

that, despite her plain 290 frock, she was in

this picture. Her father had told her that his income was rising on

a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year, and he would thank her

to spend it. Her father had told her, when she had confessed the

scene with Mr. Reuben and what led to it, that she had grit, and

that the mistake was excusable, and that a girl as pretty as she

was didn't want to be as fly as Mr. Reuben had said. Her father had

told her that he was proud of her, and he had not been so rude as

to laugh at her blunder.
She felt that she was about to enter upon the true and only

vocation of a dainty little morsel—namely, to spend money

earned by other people. She thought less homicidally now of the

thirteen chorus-girls of the previous night.
'Say,' said her father, 'I sail this afternoon for New York,

Nina.'
'They said you'd gone, at the hotel.'
'Only my baggage. The Minnehaha clears at five. I guess I

want you to come along too. On the voyage we'll get acquainted, and

tell each other things.'
'Suppose I say I won't?'
291 She spoke despotically, as the pampered

darling should.
'Then I'll wait for the next boat. But it'll be awkward.'
'Then I'll come. But I've got no things.'
He pushed up the trap-door.
'Driver, Bond Street. And get on to yourself, for goodness' sake!

Hurry!'
'You told me not to hurry,' grumbled the cabby.
'And now I tell you to hustle. See?'
'Shall you want me to call myself Belmont?' Nina asked.
'I chose it because it was a fine ten-horse-power name twenty

years ago,' said her father; and she murmured that she liked the

name very much.
As Lionel Belmont the Magnificent paid the cabman, and Nina

walked across the pavement into one of the most famous repositories

of expensive frippery in the world, she thrilled with the

profoundest pleasure her tiny soul was capable of. Foolish, simple

Nina had achieved the nec plus ultra of her languorous

dreams.

CLARICE OF THE AUTUMN CONCERTS

I
'What did you say your name was?' asked Otto, the famous concert

manager.
'Clara Toft.'
'That won't do,' he said roughly.
'My real proper name is Clarice,' she added, blushing.

'But——'
'That's better, that's better.' His large, dark face smiled

carelessly. 'Clarice—and stick an "e" on to

Toft—Clarice Tofte. Looks like either French or German then.

I'll send you the date. It'll be the second week in September. And

you can come round to the theatre and try the

piano—Bechstein.'
'And what do you think I had better play, Mr. Otto?'
'You must play what you have just played, 296 of course.

Tschaikowsky's all the rage just now. Your left hand's very weak,

especially in the last movement. You've got to make more

noise—at my concerts. And see here, Miss Toft, don't you go

and make a fool of me. I believe you have a great future, and I'm

backing my opinion. Don't you go and make a fool of me.'
'I shall play my very best,' she smiled nervously. 'I'm awfully

obliged to you, Mr. Otto.'
'Well,' he said, 'you ought to be.'
At the age of fifteen her father, an earthenware manufacturer,

and the flamboyant Alderman of Turnhill, in the Five Towns, had let

her depart to London to the Royal College of Music. Thence, at

nineteen, she had proceeded to the Conservatoire of Liége.

At twenty-two she could play the great concert pieces—Liszt's

'Rhapsodies Hongroises,' Chopin's Ballade, Op. 47, Beethoven's Op.

111, etc.—in concert style, and she was the wonder of the

Five Towns when she visited Turnhill. But in London she had

obtained neither engagements nor pupils: she had never believed in

herself. She knew of dozens of 297 pianists whom she

deemed more brilliant than little, pretty, modest Clara Toft; and

after her father's death and the not surprising revelation of his

true financial condition, she settled with her faded, captious

mother in Turnhill as a teacher of the pianoforte, and did

nicely.
Then, when she was twenty-six, and content in provincialism, she

had met during an August holiday at Llandudno her old fellow pupil,

Albert Barbellion, who was conducting the Pier concerts. Barbellion

had asked her to play at a 'soirée musicale' which he gave

one night in the ball-room of his hotel, and she had performed

Tschaikowsky's immense and lurid Slavonic Sonata; and the

unparalleled Otto, renowned throughout the British Empire for

Otto's Bohemian Autumn Nightly Concerts at Covent Garden Theatre,

had happened to hear her and that seldom played sonata for the

first time. It was a wondrous chance. Otto's large, picturesque,

extempore way of inviting her to appear at his promenade concerts

reminded her of her father.

298


II
In the bleak three-cornered artists'-room she could faintly hear

the descending impetuous velocities of the Ride of the Walkyries.

She was waiting in her new yellow dress, waiting painfully. Otto

rushed in, a glass in his hand.
'You all right?' he questioned sharply.
'Oh, yes,' she said, getting up from the cane-chair.
'Let me see you stand on one leg,' he said; and then, because

she hesitated: 'Go on, quick! Stand on one leg. It's a good test.'

So she stood on one leg, foolishly smiling. 'Here, drink this,' he

ordered, and she had to drink brandy-and-soda out of the glass.

'You're better now,' he remarked; and decidedly, though her throat

tingled and she coughed, she felt equal to anything at that

moment.
A stout, middle-aged woman, in a rather shabby opera cloak,

entered the room.
'Ah, Cornelia!' exclaimed Otto grandly.
'My dear Otto!' the woman responded, wrinkling her wonderfully

enamelled cheeks.
'Miss Toft, let me introduce you to 299 Madame Lopez.' He

turned to the newcomer. 'Keep her calm for me, bright star, will

you?'
Then Otto went, and Clarice was left alone with the world-famous

operatic soprano, who was advertised to sing that night the Shadow

Song from 'Dinorah.'
'Where did he pick you up, my dear?' the decayed diva inquired

maternally.
Clarice briefly explained.
'You aren't paying him anything, are you?'
'Oh, no!' said Clarice, shocked. 'But I get no fee this

time——'
'Of course not, my dear,' the Lopez cut her short. 'It's all

right so long as you aren't paying him anything to let you go on.

Now run along.'
Clarice's heart stopped. The call-boy, with his cockney twang,

had pronounced her name.
She moved forward, and, by dint of following the call-boy, at

length reached the stage. Applause—good-natured

applause—seemed to roll towards her from the uttermost parts

of the vast auditorium. She realized with a start that this

applause was exclusively for her. She sat down to the piano, and

there ensued a 300 death-like silence—a silence broken only

by the striking of matches and the tinkle of the embowered fountain

in front of the stage. She had a consciousness, rather than a

vision, of a floor of thousands of upturned faces below her, and

tier upon tier of faces rising above her and receding to the

illimitable dark distances of the gallery. She heard a door bang,

and perceived that some members of the orchestra were creeping

quietly out at the back. Then she plunged, dizzy, into the sonata,

as into a heaving and profound sea. The huge concert piano

resounded under the onslaught of her broad hands. When she had

played ten bars she knew with an absolute conviction that she would

do justice to her talent. She could see, as it were, the entire

sonata stretched out in detail before her like a road over which

she had to travel....
At the end of the first movement the clapping enheartened her;

she smiled confidently at the conductor, who, unemployed during her

number, sat on a chair under his desk. Before recommencing she

gazed boldly at the house, and certain placards—'Smoking

permitted,' 'Emergency exit,' 'Ices,' and 'Fancy Dress 301

Balls'—were fixed for ever on the retina of her eye. At the

end of the second movement there was more applause, and the

conductor tapped appreciation with his stick against the pillar of

his desk; the leader of the listless orchestra also tapped with his

fiddle-bow and nodded. It seemed to her now that she more and more

dominated the piano, and that she rendered the great finale with

masterful and fierce assurance....
She was pleased with herself as she banged the last massive

chord. And the applause, the clapping, the hammering of sticks,

astounded her, staggered her. She might have died of happiness

while she bowed and bowed again. She ran off the stage triumphant,

and the applause seemed to assail her little figure from all

quarters and overwhelm it. As she stood waiting, concealed behind a

group of palms, it suddenly occurred to her that, after all, she

had underestimated herself. She saw her rosy future as the spoiled

darling of continental capitals. The hail of clapping persisted,

and the apparition of Otto violently waved her to return to the

stage. She returned, bowed her passionate exultation with burning

face and 302 trembling knees, and retired. The clapping

continued. Yes, she would be compelled to grant an encore—to

grant one. She would grant it like a honeyed but imperious

queen.
Suddenly she heard the warning tap of the conductor's baton; the

applause was hushed as though by a charm, and the orchestra broke

into the overture to 'Zampa.' She could not understand, she could

not think. As she tripped tragically to the artists'-room in her

new yellow dress she said to herself that the conductor must have

made some mistake, and that——
'Very nice, my dear,' said the Lopez kindly to her. 'You got

quite a call—quite a call.'
She waited for Otto to come and talk to her.
At length the Lopez was summoned, and Clarice followed to listen

to her. And when the Lopez had soared with strong practised flight

through the brilliant intricacy of the Shadow Song, Clarice became

aware what real applause sounded like from the stage. It shook the

stage as the old favourite of two generations, wearing her set

smile, waddled back to the debutante. Scores of voices 303

hoarsely shouted 'Encore!' and 'Last Rose of Summer,' and with a

proud sigh the Lopez went on again, bowing.
Clarice saw nothing more of Otto, who doubtless had other birds

to snare. The next day only three daily papers mentioned the

concert at all. In fact, Otto expected press notices but once a

week. All three papers praised the matchless Lopez in her Shadow

Song. One referred to Clarice as talented; another called her

well-intentioned; the third merely said that she had played. The

short dream of artistic ascendancy lay in fragments around her. She

was a sensible girl, and stamped those iridescent fragments into

dust.
III
The Staffordshire Signal contained the following

advertisement: 'Miss Clara Toft, solo pianist, of the Otto Autumn

Concerts, London, will resume lessons on the 1st proximo at Liszt

House, Turnhill. Terms on application.' At thirty Clarice married

James Sillitoe, the pianoforte dealer in Market Square, Turnhill,

and captious old Mrs. Toft formed part of the new 
304 household. At

thirty-four Clarice possessed a little girl and two little boys,

twins. Sillitoe was a money-maker, and she no longer gave

lessons.
Happy? Perhaps not unhappy.

A LETTER HOME[2]


[2] Written in 1893.

I
Rain was falling—it had fallen steadily through the

night—but the sky showed promise of fairer weather. As the

first streaks of dawn appeared, the wind died away, and the young

leaves on the trees were almost silent. The birds were insistently

clamorous, vociferating times without number that it was a healthy

spring morning and good to be alive.
A little, bedraggled crowd stood before the park gates, awaiting

the hour named on the notice board when they would be admitted to

such lodging and shelter as iron seats and overspreading branches

might afford. A weary, patient-eyed, dogged crowd—a dozen

men, a boy of thirteen, and a couple of women, both past middle

age—which had been gathering 308 slowly since five

o'clock. The boy appeared to be the least uncomfortable. His feet

were bare, but he had slept well in an area in Grosvenor Place, and

was not very damp yet. The women had nodded on many doorsteps, and

were soaked. They stood apart from the men, who seemed unconscious

of their existence. The men were exactly such as one would have

expected to find there—beery and restless as to the eyes,

quaintly shod, and with nondescript greenish clothes which for the

most part bore traces of the yoke of the sandwich board. Only one

amongst them was different.
He was young, and his cap, and manner of wearing it, gave sign

of the sea. His face showed the rough outlines of his history. Yet

it was a transparently honest face, very pale, but still boyish and

fresh enough to make one wonder by what rapid descent he had

reached his present level. Perhaps the receding chin, the heavy,

pouting lower lip, and the ceaselessly twitching mouth offered a

key to the problem.
'Say, Darkey!' he said.
'Well?'
'How much longer?'
309 'Can't ye see the clock? It's staring ye in

the face.'
'No. Something queer's come over my eyes.'
Darkey was a short, sturdy man, who kept his head down and his

hands deep in his pockets. The raindrops clinging to the rim of an

ancient hat fell every now and then into his gray beard, which

presented a drowned appearance. He was a person of long and varied

experiences; he knew that queer feeling in the eyes, and his heart

softened.
'Come, lean against the pillar,' he said, 'if you don't want to

tumble. Three of brandy's what you want. There's four minutes to

wait yet.'
With body flattened to the masonry, legs apart, and head thrown

back, Darkey's companion felt more secure, and his mercurial

spirits began to revive. He took off his cap, and brushing back his

light brown curly hair with the hand which held it, he looked down

at Darkey through half-closed eyes, the play of his features

divided between a smile and a yawn.
He had a lively sense of humour, and the 310 irony of his

situation was not lost on him. He took a grim, ferocious delight in

calling up the might-have-beens and the 'fatuous ineffectual

yesterdays' of life. There is a certain sardonic satisfaction to be

gleaned from a frank recognition of the fact that you are the

architect of your own misfortune. He felt that satisfaction, and

laughed at Darkey, who was one of those who moan about 'ill-luck'

and 'victims of circumstance.'
'No doubt,' he would say, 'you're a very deserving fellow,

Darkey, who's been treated badly. I'm not.'
To have attained such wisdom at twenty-five is not to have lived

altogether in vain.
A park-keeper presently arrived to unlock the gates, and the

band of outcasts straggled indolently towards the nearest sheltered

seats. Some went to sleep at once, in a sitting posture. Darkey

produced a clay pipe, and, charging it with a few shreds of tobacco

laboriously gathered from his waistcoat pocket, began to smoke. He

was accustomed to this sort of thing, and with a pipe in his mouth

could contrive to be moderately philosophical upon occasion. He

looked curiously at his companion, 311 who lay stretched at

full length on another bench.
'I say, pal,' he remarked, 'I've known ye two days; ye've never

told me yer name, and I don't ask ye to. But I see ye've not slep'

in a park before.'
'You hit it, Darkey; but how?'
'Well, if the keeper catches ye lying down, he'll be on to ye.

Lying down's not allowed.'
The man raised himself on his elbow.
'Really now,' he said; 'that's interesting. But I think I'll

give the keeper the opportunity of moving me. Why, it's quite fine,

the sun's coming out, and the sparrows are hopping

round—cheeky little devils! I'm not sure that I don't feel

jolly.'
'I wish I'd got the price of a pint about me,' sighed Darkey,

and the other man dropped his head and appeared to sleep. Then

Darkey dozed a little, and heard in his waking sleep the heavy,

crunching tread of an approaching park-keeper; he started up to

warn his companion, but thought better of it, and closed his eyes

again.
'Now then, there,' the park-keeper shouted to the man with the

sailor's cap, 'get up! 312 This ain't a

fourpenny doss, you know. No lying down.'
A rough shake accompanied the words, and the man sat up.
'All right, my friend.'
The keeper, who was a good-humoured man, passed on without

further objurgation.
The face of the younger man had grown whiter.
'Look here, Darkey,' he said, 'I believe I'm done for.'
'Never say die.'
'No, just die without speaking.'
His head fell forward and his eyes closed.
'At any rate, this is better than some deaths I've seen,' he

began again with a strange accession of liveliness. 'Darkey, did I

tell you the story of the five Japanese girls?'
'What, in Suez Bay?' said Darkey, who had heard many sea-stories

during the last two days, and recollected them but hazily.
'No, man. This was at Nagasaki. We were taking in a cargo of

coal for Hong Kong. Hundreds of little Jap girls pass the coal from

hand to hand over the ship's side in tiny baskets that hold about a

plateful. In that way you 313 can get three

thousand tons aboard in two days.'
'Talking of platefuls reminds me of sausage and mash,' said

Darkey.
'Don't interrupt. Well, five of these gay little dolls wanted to

go to Hong Kong, and they arranged with the Chinese sailors to stow

away; I believe their friends paid those cold-blooded fiends

something to pass them down food on the voyage, and give them an

airing at nights. We had a particularly lively trip, battened

everything down tight, and scarcely uncovered till we got into

port. Then I and another man found those five girls among the

coal.'
'Dead, eh?'
'They'd simply torn themselves to pieces. Their bits of frock

things were in strips, and they were scratched deep from top to

toe. The Chinese had never troubled their heads about them at all,

although they must have known it meant death. You may bet there was

a row. The Japanese authorities make you search ship before

sailing, now.'
'Well?'
'Well, I shan't die like that. That's all.'
314 He stretched himself out once more, and for

ten minutes neither spoke. The park-keeper strolled up again.
'Get up, there!' he said shortly and gruffly.
'Up ye get, mate,' added Darkey, but the man on the bench did

not stir. One look at his face sufficed to startle the keeper, and

presently two policemen were wheeling an ambulance cart to the

hospital. Darkey followed, gave such information as he could, and

then went his own ways.
II
In the afternoon the patient regained full consciousness. His

eyes wandered vacantly about the illimitable ward, with its rows of

beds stretching away on either side of him. A woman with a white

cap, a white apron, and white wristbands bent over him, and he felt

something gratefully warm passing down his throat. For just one

second he was happy. Then his memory returned, and the nurse saw

that he was crying. When he caught the nurse's eye he ceased, and

looked steadily at the distant ceiling.
315 'You're better?'
'Yes.'
He tried to speak boldly, decisively, nonchalantly. He was

filled with a sense of physical shame, the shame which bodily

helplessness always experiences in the presence of arrogant,

patronizing health. He would have got up and walked briskly away if

he could. He hated to be waited on, to be humoured, to be examined

and theorized about. This woman would be wanting to feel his pulse.

She should not; he would turn cantankerous. No doubt they had been

saying to each other, 'And so young, too! How sad!' Confound

them!
'Have you any friends that you would like to send for?'
'No, none.'
The girl—she was only a girl—looked at him, and

there was that in her eye which overcame him.
'None at all?'
'Not that I want to see.'
'Are your parents alive?'
'My mother is, but she lives away in the Five Towns.'
316 'You've not seen her lately, perhaps?'
He did not reply, and the nurse spoke again, but her voice

sounded indistinct and far off.
When he awoke it was night. At the other end of the ward was a

long table covered with a white cloth, and on this table a

lamp.
In the ring of light under the lamp was an open book, an

inkstand and a pen. A nurse—not his nurse—was

standing by the table, her fingers idly drumming the cloth, and

near her a man in evening dress. Perhaps a doctor. They were

conversing in low tones. In the middle of the ward was an open

stove, and the restless flames were reflected in all the brass

knobs of the bedsteads and in some shining metal balls which hung

from an unlighted chandelier. His part of the ward was almost in

darkness. A confused, subdued murmur of little coughs, breathings,

rustlings, was continually audible, and sometimes it rose above the

conversation at the table. He noticed all these things. He became

conscious, too, of a strangely familiar smell. What was it? Ah,

yes! Acetic acid; his mother used it for her rheumatics.
317 Suddenly, magically, a great longing came over

him. He must see his mother, or his brothers, or his little

sister—someone who knew him, someone who belonged to

him. He could have cried out in his desire. This one thought

consumed all his faculties. If his mother could but walk in just

now through that doorway! If only old Spot even could amble up to

him, tongue out and tail furiously wagging! He tried to sit up, and

he could not move! Then despair settled on him, and weighed him

down. He closed his eyes.
The doctor and the nurse came slowly up the ward, pausing here

and there. They stopped before his bed, and he held his breath.
'Not roused up again, I suppose?'
'No.'
'H'm! He may flicker on for forty-eight hours. Not more.'
They went on, and with a sigh of relief he opened his eyes

again. The doctor shook hands with the nurse, who returned to the

table and sat down.
Death! The end of all this! Yes, it was coming. He felt it. His

had been one of 318 those wasted lives of which he used to read in

books. How strange! Almost amusing! He was one of those sons who

bring sorrow and shame into a family. Again, how strange! What a

coincidence that he—just he and not the man in the

next bed—should be one of those rare, legendary

good-for-nothings who go recklessly to ruin. And yet, he was sure

that he was not such a bad fellow after all. Only somehow he had

been careless. Yes, careless; that was the word ... nothing

worse.... As to death, he was indifferent. Remembering his father's

death, he reflected that it was probably less disturbing to die

one's self than to watch another pass.
He smelt the acetic acid once more, and his thoughts reverted to

his mother. Poor mother! No, great mother! The grandeur of her

life's struggle filled him with a sense of awe. Strange that until

that moment he had never seen the heroic side of her humdrum,

commonplace existence! He must write to her, now, at once, before

it was too late. His letter would trouble her, add another wrinkle

to her face, but he must write; she must know that he had been

thinking of her.
319 'Nurse!' he cried out, in a thin, weak

voice.
'Ssh!'
She was by his side directly, but not before he had lost

consciousness again.
The following morning he managed with infinite labour to scrawl

a few lines:

'DEAR MAMMA,
'You will be surprised but not glad to get this letter. I'm done

for, and you will never see me again. I'm sorry for what I've done,

and how I've treated you, but it's no use saying anything now. If

Pater had only lived he might have kept me in order. But you were

too kind, you know. You've had a hard struggle these last six

years, and I hope Arthur and Dick will stand by you better than I

did, now they are growing up. Give them my love, and kiss little

Fannie for me.
'WILLIE.
'Mrs. Hancock——'

He got no further with the address.

By some turn of the wheel, Darkey gathered several shillings

during the next day or two, and, feeling both elated and

benevolent, he called one afternoon at the hospital, 'just to

inquire like.' They told him the man was dead.
'By the way, he left a letter without an address. Mrs.

Hancock—here it is.'
'That'll be his mother; he did tell me about her—lived at

Knype, Staffordshire, he said. I'll see to it.'
They gave Darkey the letter.
'So his name's Hancock,' he soliloquized, when he got into the

street. 'I knew a girl of that name—once. I'll go and have a

pint of four-half.'
At nine o'clock that night Darkey was still consuming four-half,

and relating certain adventures by sea which, he averred, had

happened to himself. He was very drunk.
'Yes,' he said, 'and them five lil' gals was lying there without

a stitch on 'em, dead as meat; 's 'true as I'm 'ere. I've seen a

thing or two in my time, I can tell ye.'
321 'Talking about these Anarchists—' said a

man who appeared anxious to change the subject.
'An—kists,' Darkey interrupted. 'I tell ye what I'd do

with that muck.'
He stopped to light his pipe, looked in vain for a match, felt

in his pockets, and pulled out a piece of paper—the

letter.
'I tell you what I'd do. I'd—'
He slowly and meditatively tore the letter in two, dropped one

piece on the floor, thrust the other into a convenient gas-jet, and

applied it to the tobacco.
'I'd get 'em 'gether in a heap, and I'd—Damn this

pipe!'
He picked up the other half of the letter, and relighted the

pipe.
'After you, mate,' said a man sitting near, who was just biting

the end from a cigar.


THE END.
