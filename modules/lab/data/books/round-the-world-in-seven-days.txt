PRELUDE
Lieutenant George Underhill, commanding H.M. surveying ship

Albatross, had an unpleasant shock when he turned out of his

bunk at daybreak one morning. The barometer stood at 29.41'. For two

or three days the vessel had encountered dirty weather, but there had

been signs of improvement when he turned in, and it was decidedly

disconcerting to find that the glass had fallen. His vessel was a

small one, and he was a little uneasy at the prospect of being caught

by a cyclone while in the imperfectly-charted waters of the Solomon

Islands.
He was approaching the eastern shore of Ysabel Island, whose steep

cliffs were covered with a lurid bank of cloud. If the shore was like

those of the other islands of the group, it would be, he knew, a maze

of bays, islets, barrier reefs, and intricate channels amid which,

even in calm weather, a vessel would run a considerable risk of

grounding, a risk that would be multiplied in a storm. Anxiously

noting the weather signs, Underhill hoped that he might reach a safe

anchorage before the threatening cyclone burst upon him.
As is the way with cyclones, it smote the vessel almost without

warning. A howling squall tore out of the east, catching the ship

nearly abeam, and making her shudder; then, after a brief lull, came

another and even a fiercer blast, and in a few minutes the wind

increased to a roaring hurricane, enveloping the ship in a mist of

driving rain that half choked the officers and crew as they crouched

under the lee of the bulwarks and the deckhouse.
The Albatross was a gallant little vessel, and Underhill,

now that what he dreaded had happened, hoped at least to keep her off

the shore until the fury of the storm had abated. For a time she

thrashed her way doggedly through the boiling sea; but all at once

she staggered, heeled over, and then, refusing to answer the helm,

began to rush headlong upon the rocks, now visible through the mist.
"Propeller shaft broken, sir," came the cry from below to Underhill as

he stood clinging to the rail of the bridge.
He felt his utter helplessness. He could not even let go an anchor,

for no one could stand on deck against the force of the wind. He could

only cling to his place and see the vessel driven ashore, without

being able to lift a hand to save her. Suddenly he was conscious of a

grating, grinding sensation beneath his feet, and knew that the vessel

had struck a coral reef. She swung round broadside to the wind; the

boats on the weather side were wrenched from their davits and hurled

away in splinters; and in the midst of such fury and turmoil there was

no possibility of launching the remaining two boats and escaping from

the doomed vessel.
All hands had rushed on deck, and clung to rails and stays and

whatever else afforded a hold. Among those who staggered from the

companion way was a tall thin man, spectacled, with iron-grey hair and

beard, and somewhat rounded shoulders. Linking arms with him was a

young man of twenty-two or twenty-three: the likeness between them

proclaimed them father and son. The older man was Dr. Thesiger Smith,

the famous geologist, in furtherance of whose work the Albatross was

making this voyage. The younger man was his second son Tom, who, after

a distinguished career at Cambridge, had come out to act as his

father's assistant.
Underhill knew by the jerking and grinding he felt beneath him that

his ill-fated vessel was being slowly forced over the reef towards the

shore. His first lieutenant, Venables, crawled up to the bridge, and,

bawling into his ear, asked if anything could be done. The lieutenant

shook his head.
"Water's within two feet of the upper deck forward, sir," shouted

Venables; "abaft it is three feet above the keelson."
"Get the lifebuoys," was the brief reply.
Venables crawled down again, and with the assistance of some of the

crew unlashed the lifebuoys and distributed them among the company.

Meanwhile the progress of the vessel shorewards had been suddenly

checked. She came up with a jerk, and Underhill guessed that her nose

had stuck fast in a hollow of the reef, and prayed that the storm

would abate for just so long as would enable him to get the boats

clear and make for the land before the ship broke up. But for a good

half-hour longer the hurricane blew with undiminished force, and it

was as much as every man could do to avoid being washed away by the

mountainous seas that broke over the vessel.
At length, however, there came a sudden change. The uproar ceased as

by magic, and there fell a dead calm. Underhill was not deceived. He

judged that the vessel was now in the centre of the cyclone; the calm

might last for forty or fifty minutes, then a renewal of the hurricane

was almost certainly to be expected. Without the loss of a moment he

gave his orders. The boats were made ready; into one they put arms,

ammunition, and tools, together with the ship's papers and

chronometer, a compass, and Dr. Thesiger Smith's specimens and

diaries; into the other more ammunition, and a portion of what

provisions could be collected from above or below water. The boats

were lowered, the men dropped into them and pulled off, leaving

Underhill and two or three of the crew still on the vessel to collect

the remainder of the provisions and whatever else seemed worth saving.

The sea was so high that the boats had much difficulty in making the

shore; but they reached it safely, and one of them, after being

rapidly unloaded, returned for the commander.
Before it regained the ship, Underhill felt a light puff of wind from

the south-west. Lifting a megaphone, he roared to the men to pull for

their lives. The boat came alongside; it had scarcely received its

load when the hurricane once more burst upon them, this time from the

opposite quarter. Underhill leapt down among his men, and ordered them

to give way. Before they had pulled a dozen strokes the storm was at

its height, but the force of the wind was now somewhat broken by the

trees and rocks of the island. Even so it was hard work, rowing in the

teeth of the blast, the boat being every moment in danger of swamping

by the tremendous seas. Underhill, at the tiller, set his teeth, and

anxiously watched the advancing cliffs, at the foot of which the

remainder of his company stood. The boat was within twenty yards of

them when a huge wave fell on it as it were out of the sky. It sank

like lead. Thanks to the lifebuoys Underhill and the men rose quickly

to the surface. Two of them, who could not swim, cried out

despairingly for help. Underhill seized one and held him up; the other

was saved by the promptitude of young Smith. Seeing their plight, he

caught up a rope which had been brought ashore, and flung it among the

group of men struggling in the water. The drowning man clutched it,

the others swam to it, and by its aid all were drawn ashore, gasping

for breath, and sorely battered by the jagged rocks.
"All safe, thank heaven!" said Underhill, as he joined the others;

"but I'm sorry we've lost the boat."
The shipwrecked party found themselves on a narrow beach, behind which

rose steep cliffs, rugged and difficult to climb. Against these they

crouched to find some shelter from the storm, and watch the gradual

dismemberment of the ill-fated Albatross. Wave after wave broke over

her, the spray dashing so high that even her funnel sometimes

disappeared from view. The spectators held their breath: could she

live out the storm? At last a tremendous sea swept her from the hollow

in which she was wedged, and she plunged beneath the waters.

Round the World

CHAPTER I
THE CABLEGRAM
 
"Tenez! up! up! Ah ça! A clean shave, mister, hein?"
A touch on the lever had sent the aeroplane soaring aloft at a steep

angle, and she cleared by little more than a hair's breadth the edge

of a thick plantation of firs.
"A close shave, as you say, Roddy," came the answer. And then the

speaker let forth a gust of wrathful language which his companion

heard in sympathetic silence.
Lieutenant Charles Thesiger Smith, of H.M.S. Imperturbable, was

normally a good-tempered fellow, and his outburst would have deceived

nobody who knew him so well as Laurent Rodier.
It was the dusk of an evening in mid spring. Above, the sky was clear,

washed by the rain that had fallen without intermission since early

morning. Below, the chill of coming night, acting on the

moisture-laden air, had covered the land with a white mist, that

curled and heaved beneath the aeroplane in huge waves. It looked like

a billowy sea of cotton-wool, but the airmen who had just emerged from

it, had no comfort in its soft embrace. Their eyes were smarting, they

drew their breath painfully, and little streams of water trickling

from the soaked planes made cold, shuddering streaks on their faces

and necks.
An hour ago they had sailed by Salisbury spire, calculating that a few

minutes' run, at two or three miles a minute, would bring them to

their destination on the outskirts of Portsmouth. But a few miles

south the baffling mist had made its appearance, and Smith found

himself bereft of landmarks, and compelled to tack to and fro in utter

uncertainty of his course. He was as much at a loss as if he were

navigating a vessel in a sea-fog. To sail through the mist was to

incur the risk of striking a tree, a chimney, or a church steeple; to

pursue his flight above it in the deepening dusk might carry him miles

out of his way, and though a southerly course must presently bring him

to the sea, he could not tell how far east or west of his intended

landing-place. Meanwhile the petrol was running short, and it was

clear that before long his dilemma would be solved by the engine

stopping, and bringing him to the ground willy-nilly, goodness knows

where.
This was vexing enough, but in the particular circumstances it was a

crowning stroke of misfortune. To-day was the twenty-first of his

twenty-eight days' leave: to-morrow he was to begin a round of what he

called duty visits among his relatives; he would have to motor, play

golf, dance attendance on girls at theatres and concerts, and spur

himself to a thousand activities that he detested. There was no escape

for him. Perhaps he could have faced this seven days' penance more

equably if he had had the recollection of three well-employed weeks to

sweeten it. Even this was denied him. Ever since he came on leave the

weather had been abominable: high wind, incessant rain, all the

elements conspiring to prevent the enjoyment of his hobby. Rodier had

suggested that he should apply for an extension of leave, but Smith,

though he did not lack courage, could not screw it to this pitch. He

remembered too vividly his interview with the captain when coming off

ship.
"Don't smash yourself up," said the captain, "and don't run things too

fine. You're always late in getting back from leave. Last time you

only got in by the skin of your teeth, when we were off shooting, too.

If you overstep the mark again you'll find yourself brought up with a

round turn, you may take my word for it."
"I couldn't beg off after that," he said to Rodier. "Anyway, it's

rotten bad luck."
"Précisément ca!" said Rodier sympathetically.
For some little time they sailed slowly on, seeking in vain for a rift

in the blanket of mist: then Rodier cried suddenly—
"Better take a drop, mister. In three minutes all the petrol is gone,

and then—"
"I'm afraid you're right, Roddy, but goodness knows what we shall fall

on. We must take our chance, I suppose."
He adjusted the planes, so as to make a gradual descent while the

engine still enabled him to keep way on the machine, and it sank into

the mist. Both men kept a sharp look-out, knowing well that to

encounter a branch of a tree or a chimney-stack might at any moment

bring the voyage, the aeroplane, and themselves to an untimely end.

All at once, without warning, a large dark shape loomed out of the

mist. Smith instantly warped his planes, and the machine dived so

precipitately as almost to throw him from his seat. Next moment there

was a shock; he was flung headlong forward, and found himself

sprawling half suffocated on a damp yielding mass, which, when he had

recovered his wits, he knew to be the unthatched top of a hayrick.
His first thought was for the aeroplane. Raising himself, and dashing

the clinging hay wisps from his face, he shouted—
"Is she smashed, Roddy?"
"Ah, no, mister," came the answering cry. "She stick fast, and me

also."
Smith crawled to the edge of the rick and dropped to the ground. Two

or three dogs were barking furiously somewhere in the neighbourhood. A

few steps brought him to the aeroplane, lying in a slanting position

between the hayrick and a fence, over which it projected. Rodier had

clung to his seat, and had suffered nothing worse than a jolting.
"This is a pretty mess," said Smith despairingly, "one end stuck fast

in the hayrick, the other sticking over the fence: they'll have to

pull it down before we can get her out. Get off, you brute!" he

exclaimed, as a dog came yapping at his legs.
"Seize him, Pompey: seize him, good dog!" cried a rough voice.
"Call him off, or I'll break his head," cried Smith in exasperation.
"You will, will you?" roared the farmer. "I'll teach you to come

breaking into my yard: I'll have the law of you."
"Don't be absurd, man," replied Smith, fending off the dog as well as

he could. "Don't you see I've had an accident?"
"Accident be jiggered!" said the farmer. "You don't come breaking into

my yard by accident. Better stand quiet or he'll tear you to bits."
"Oh, come now!" said Smith. "Look at this. Here's my aeroplane, fixed

up here. You don't suppose I came down here on purpose? I lost my way

in this confounded mist, and don't know where I am. Just be sensible,

there's a decent chap, and get some of your men to help us out. I'll

pay damages."
"I'll take care of that," said the farmer curtly. "What the country's

coming to I don't know, what with motors killing us on the roads and

now these here airyplanes making the very air above us poison to

breathe. There ought to be a law to stop it, that's what I say.

Down, Pompey! What's your name, mister?"
Smith explained, asking in his turn the name of the place where he had

alighted. Farmer Barton was a good patriot, and the knowledge that the

intruder was a navy-man sensibly moderated his truculence.
"Why, this be Firtop Farm, half-a-mile from Mottisfont station, if you

know where that is," he said. "Daze me if you hain't been and cut into

my hayrick!" He sniffed. "And what's this horrible smell? I do believe

you've spoilt the whole lot with your stinking oil." He was getting

angry again.
"Well, I've said I'll pay for it," said Smith impatiently. "Get your

men, farmer, or I shan't be home to-night. I suppose I can get some

petrol somewhere about here?"
"You might, or you might not, in the village; I can't say. My men are

abed and asleep, long ago. You'll have to bide till morning."
"Oh well, if I must, I must. Roddy, just have a look at the machine

and see that she's safe for the night. I'll run down to the station

and send a wire home, and then get beds in the village."
"Better be sharp, then," said the farmer. "You can't send no wire

after eight, and it's pretty near that now. I'll show you the way."
Smith hurried to the station and despatched his telegram; then,

learning that there was a train due at 8.2 from Andover, he decided to

wait a few minutes and get an evening paper. An aviation meeting had

just been held at Tours, and he was anxious to see how the English

competitors had fared. The train was only a few minutes late. Smith

asked the guard whether he had brought any papers, and to his vexation

learnt that, there being no bookstall at Mottisfont, there were none

for that station. However, the guard himself had bought a paper before

leaving Waterloo.
"Take it and welcome, sir," he said. "I've done with it. You're

Lieutenant Smith, if I'm not mistaken. Seen your portrait in the

papers,' sir."
"Thanks, guard," said Smith, pressing a coin into his reluctant hand.
"Englishmen doing well in France, sir. Hope to see you a prize-winner

one of these days. Goodnight!"
The train rumbled off, and Smith scanned the columns by the light of a

platform lamp. He read the report of the meeting in which he was

interested: a Frenchman had made a new record in altitude; an

Englishman had won a fine race, coming in first of ten competitors; a

terrible accident had befallen a well-known airman at the moment of

descending. The most interesting piece of news was that a Frenchman

had maintained for three hours an average speed of a hundred and

twenty miles.
"I'm only just in time," said Smith to himself. He was folding the

paper when his eye was caught by a heading that recalled the days of

his boyhood, when he had revelled in stories of savages, pirates, and

the hundred and one themes that fascinate the ingenuous mind.
 
SHIPWRECKED AMONG CANNIBALS.


      TERRIBLE SITUATION OF FAMOUS SCIENTIST.
 
      (From Our Own Correspondent.)
      BRISBANE, Thursday.
      A barque put in here to-day with four men picked up from an

      open boat south of New Guinea, who reported that the

      Government survey vessel Albatross has run ashore in a

      storm on Ysabel Island, one of the Solomon group. The crew

      and passengers, including Dr. Thesiger Smith, the famous

      geologist, were saved, but the vessel is a complete wreck,

      and the unfortunate people were compelled to camp on the

      shore. They are very short of provisions, and being

      practically unarmed are in great danger of being massacred

      by the natives, who are believed to be one of the fiercest

      cannibal tribes in the South Sea.
      Four of the crew put off in the ship's boat to seek

      assistance, but they lost their mast and had to rely on the

      oars, and drifted for several days before being picked up

      in the Coral Sea. A gunboat will be despatched immediately,

      but since it cannot reach the island for at least five

      days, it is greatly to be feared that it will arrive only

      to find that help has come too late.
 
Smith ran his eyes rapidly over the lines, then folded the paper, and

  put it into his pocket. He did not notice that his hand was trembling.

  The station-master looked curiously after him as he strode away with

  set face.
"Seems to have had bad news," he said to his head porter.
"Bin plungin' on a wrong un, maybe," replied the porter.
Smith left the station, and hastened down the road towards the farm.

He had clean forgotten his intention of bespeaking beds in the

village; indeed, he walked as one insensible to all around him until

he caught sight of the word GARAGE, painted in large white letters,

illuminated by an electric lamp, over a gateway at the side of the

road. Then he swung round and, passing through the gate, came to a

lighted shed where he found a man cleaning a motor car.
"Any petrol to be got here?" he asked quickly.
"As much as we're allowed to keep, sir," replied the man.
"Send a can at once to Firtop Farm, down the road."
He turned, and was quitting the shed when a word from the man recalled

him.
"Beg pardon, sir, but—"
"Oh, here's your money," cried Smith, handing him a crown-piece. "Be

quick. By the way, can you lend me two or three men for half-an-hour

or so at five shillings an hour?"
"Right you are, sir," was the reply. "I'm one; I'll get you a couple

more in no time. Be there as soon as you, sir."
Smith hurried away. On reaching the farm he found that Rodier and the

farmer were engaged in a friendly conversation, by the light of a

carriage lamp which flickered wanly in the mist.
"Wonderful machine, sir," said the farmer, whom Rodier had talked out

of his ill-humour. "Your man has been showing me over it, as you may

say, leastways as well as he could in this fog."
"We must get her out at once," rejoined Smith. "Some men are coming

up. We must get on to-night."
"Good sakes! that's impossible. She lies right athwart the fence, and

you'll have to rig a crane to lift her."
"The fence must come down. I'll pay."
"But drat it all—"
"Look here, farmer, it's got to be done. Here are the men; just oblige

me by showing them a light at the fence, and set them to take down

enough of it to free the aeroplane—carefully; I don't want it

smashed. There's a sovereign on account; you shall have a cheque for

the rest when you send in the bill."
Apparently the magic touch of gold reconciled the farmer to these

hasty proceedings, for he made no more ado, but took the lamp and bade

the three men to follow him.
"What's wrong, mister?" asked Rodier. "You look as if you had been

shocked."
Smith drew the paper from his pocket, gave it to Rodier, and then,

striking a match, showed him the paragraph, and lighted more matches

while he read it.
"Mon dieu!" ejaculated the Frenchman, when he was halfway through. "It

is your father!"
"Yes; my brother is with him. I must get home; it will kill my mother

if she sees this."
Rodier read the paragraph to the end.
"My word, it is bad business," he said. "These cannibals!... And they

have no arms. What horror!"
Smith left him abruptly and walked to the fence to see how the work of

dismantling it was proceeding. Rodier whistled, and thrusting his

hands into his pockets, sat down on a bag of straw and appeared to be

deep in a brown study. Sounds of hammering came from the fence; a

light breeze was scattering the mist, and he could now see clearly the

three men under the farmer's direction carefully removing the fencing

beneath the aeroplane. Rodier watched them for a few minutes, but an

onlooker would have gathered the impression that his thoughts were far

away.
Suddenly he sprang up, muttering, "Ah! On peut le faire, quand même.

Courage, mon ami!" and hastened to rejoin his employer.
"What distance, mister," he said, "from here to there—to the

cannibals?"
"Thirteen thousand miles, I suppose, more or less."
"Ah!" the Frenchman's face fell. "Thirteen thousand!" he repeated,

then was silent for a while, touching his brow as if making some

abstruse calculation. Smith turned away.
"Ah! Qu'importe?" cried Rodier, after a few moments. "On peut le

faire!"
He hastened to Smith, drew him aside, and spoke rapidly to him for a

few moments. The look of doubt that first came to Smith's face was

soon replaced by a look of confidence. He engaged in a hurried

colloquy with his man, at the close of which they shook hands heartily

and went to the fence to lend a hand there.
In half-an-hour the work was done; the fence was down, and the six men

carefully dragged and lifted the aeroplane over the débris, and placed

it on the road outside. While Rodier made a rapid examination of it,

to see that no damage had been done, Smith got the men to empty into

the tank the can of petrol they had brought, paid them for their

work, and handed his card to the farmer.
"Send in your bill," he cried. "Ready, Roddy?"
"All right, mister."
They jumped into their seats. Smith called to the men to stand clear,

and pulled the lever. At the same moment Rodier switched on the

searchlight. The propellers flew round with deafening whirr; the

aeroplane shot forward for thirty or forty yards along the road, then

rose like a bird into the air.
The men stood with mouths agape as the machine flew over the

tree-tops, its light diminishing to a pin-point, its clamour sinking

to the quiet hum of a bee, and then fading away altogether. In a

minute it had totally disappeared.
"Daze me if ever I seed anything like that afore," said the farmer. "A

mile a minute, what?"
"More like two," said the motorman. "I lay she'll be in Portsmouth

afore I'm half-a-mile up road. Good-night, farmer, I'm off to the

Three Waggoners."
"Bust if I don't go, too. There be summat to wet our whistles on

to-night, eh, men?"

CHAPTER II
EASTWARD HO!
 
Before the farmer reached the hospitable door of the Three Waggoners,

  Smith had made his descent upon a broad open space in his father's

  park near Cosham. There stood the large shed in which he housed the

  aeroplane; adjoining it were a number of workshops. It was quite dark

  now, and no one was about; but Smith clearly had no intention of

  putting his machine up for the night. As soon as he came to the ground

  he hurried off on foot in one direction, Rodier on a bicycle in

  another, their purposeful movements betokening a course of action

  arranged during the few minutes' conversation at the farm.
Smith walked rapidly through the park, and, entering the house, found

his mother placidly knitting on a settee in the large old-fashioned

hall.
"Ah, my dear boy," she said, as he appeared; "how late you are, and

how dirty! We have waited dinner for you."
"You shouldn't have done that, mother," he replied cheerfully; "though

it's very good of you."
"Well, you see, it's your last night with us for ever so long, and

with Tom and your father away—"
"Yes, I'm sorry I'm so late," Smith broke in hastily. "We were caught

in a mist. I shan't be ten minutes changing."
He ran up the stairs, and before going to his room put his head in at

the door of his sister's.
"You there, Kate? You didn't get my telegram, then? Come to my room in

ten minutes, will you? I want to see you particularly before dinner."
With a seaman's quickness he was bathed and dressed within the time he

had named.
"Come in," he said, as his sister tapped. "You've got a pretty cool

head, Sis; look at this, quickly."
He handed her the evening paper, pointing out the fateful paragraph.

Kate went a little pale as she read it; her bosom heaved, but she said

nothing.
"It must be kept from Mother," he said. "Get hold of to-morrow's

paper, and if the paragraph is there, cut it out or tear off the

page."
"But people will write, or call. They are sure to speak of it."
"That's your chance. Intercept 'em. You always read the Mater's

letters to her, don't you? Keep the servants' mouths shut. And I want

you to write for me to all those people and cry off; pressing

business—any excuse you like."
"But you, Charley?"
"I'm off to London, to-night; must see what can be done for the old

dad, you know."
"How shall we explain to Mother? She has been looking forward to your

spending your last night at home."
"Roddy will come up by and by with an urgent telephone message. The

Mater is so used to that sort of thing that she won't smell a rat."
"How you think of everything, Charley! But I'm afraid Mother will

notice something in our manner at dinner."
"Not if we're careful. You take your cue from me. Come along!"
No one would have guessed at that dinner table that anything was

amiss. Smith seemed to be in the highest spirits, talking incessantly,

describing his sudden descent on Firtop Farm and his interview with

the farmer so racily that his mother laughed gently, and even Kate,

for all her anxiety, smiled. In the middle of the meal the belated

telegram arrived, giving Smith an opportunity for poking fun at

official slowness.
Dinner was hardly over when a servant announced that Mr. Rodier was

below, asking to see Mr. Smith upon particular business. Smith slowly

lighted a cigarette before he left the room. He found Rodier in the

hall.
"Got it, Roddy?" he asked.
"Yes, I ask for globe: Mr. Dawkins give me first a pink paper. 'Sad

news this!' says he."
"I hope to goodness he'll hold his tongue about it."
"He must have it back to-morrow, he said. The inspector is coming."
"All right. Now cut off to the housekeeper and stroke as hard as you

can. I don't know when you'll get another meal."
Returning to the dining-room, Smith said—
"Sorry, Mater, I've got to go to London at once. Too bad, isn't it,

spoiling our last night. Ah well! it can't be helped."
"Is it Admiralty business, Charley?" asked his mother.
"Well, not exactly; something about a wreck, I think."
"I suppose I had better send on your things to the Leslies in the

morning?"
"I'll send you a wire. I mayn't go there, after all. Nuisance having

to change again, isn't it?"
He hastened from the room, got into his air-man suit, covered it with

an overall, emptied his cash-box into his pocket, and returned to say

good-bye. Kate accompanied him to the door.
"Buck up, old girl," he said, as he kissed her. "I'll let you know

what happens, if I can. By the way, there's a globe in the shed I want

you to send back to Dawkins, the school-master, first thing to-morrow.

Good-bye! Send Roddy after me as soon as he has finished his grub."
He hurried through the park, and coming to the shed, switched on the

electric light, which revealed a litter of all sorts of objects:

models, parts of machinery, including an aero-cycle on which he had

spent many fruitless hours, and, on a bench, a small geographical

globe of the world. Taking up a piece of string, he made certain

measurements on the globe, jotting down sundry names and rows of

figures on a piece of paper. Then he went to a telephone box in a

corner of the shed, and rang up a certain club in London, asking if

Mr. William Barracombe was there. After the interval usual in trunk

calls, he began—
"That you, Billy? Good! Thought I'd catch you. Can you give me an hour

or two?... What?... No: not this time. No time for explanations just

now.... Right!... Exactly: nothing ever surprises you." (A smile

flickered on his face.) "Well, I want you to wire to

Constantinople—Con-stant-i-no-ple—to some decent firm, and arrange

for them to have eighty gallons of petrol and sixteen of lubricating

oil ready first thing to-morrow.... Yes, to the order of Lieutenant

Smith.... Also means of transport, motor if possible: if not,

horses.—I say, Central, don't cut me off, please. Yes, I know my

time's up: I'll renew.—You there, Billy? That all right?... No,

that's not all. I want you to meet me on Epsom Downs about

midnight.... Yes, coming by 'plane.... Wait a bit. Bring with you four

bottles of bovril, couple of pounds meat lozenges, half-dozen tins

sardines, bottle of brandy—yes, and soda, as you say; couple of

pounds chocolate, two tins coffee and milk.... No: I say, hold on....

Also orographical maps—maps ... o-ro-graph-i-cal maps ... of Asia

Minor, Southern Asia including India, Straits Settlements,

Polynesia.... I don't know: Stanford's will be shut, but I must have

'em.... That's up to you. Bring 'em all down with you.... Well, you'd

better light a bonfire, so that I can tell where you are. You'll

manage it? Good man! See you about midnight then.... Yes: I saw it;

bad business. Hope they'll manage to hold out.... Tell you when I see

you. Goodbye!"
He replaced the receiver, and turned to find Rodier at his elbow.
"Now, Roddy," he said, "we've got two hours. Slip into it, man."
For the next two hours they worked with scarcely the exchange of a

word, overhauling every part of the engine quickly, but with

methodical care, cleaning, oiling, testing the exhaust and the

carburettor, filling the petrol tank and the reservoir of lubricating

oil, examining the turbines and the propeller—not a square inch of

the machinery escaped their attention. When their task was finished

they were as hot and dirty as engine-drivers. They washed at a sink,

filled two stone jars with water and placed them in the cage, adjusted

the wind screens, and then sat down to rest and talk over things

before starting on their night journey. Smith pencilled some

calculations on a piece of paper, referring more than once to the

globe. Then taking a clean piece, he drew up a schedule which had some

resemblance to a railway timetable.
"There! How does that strike you, Roddy?" he said, when he had

finished it.
"It strikes me hot," said the Frenchman. "What I mean, it will be hot

work. But that is what I like."
"So do I, so long as I can keep cool. At any rate we can start to the

second. Are you ready?"
The sky was brilliant with stars when, just after midnight, they took

their places in the aeroplane. Twenty-five minutes' easy run,

east-north-east, brought them within sight of the dull red glare

northward that betrayed London. Smith had so often made this journey

that, even if the stars had been invisible, he could almost have

directed his course by the lights of the villages and towns over which

he passed. He knew them as well as a sailor knows the lights of the

coast.
Just before half-past twelve, in a steep slope on his right, looming

up black against the sky, he recognized Box Hill. Passing this at a

moderate pace, which allowed them to take a good look-out, they saw in

a minute or two a small red flame flickering in the midst of a dark

expanse. Every second it grew larger as they approached; Smith did not

doubt it was the bonfire which he had asked his friend Barracombe to

kindle. Dropping to the ground within a few feet of the fire, which

turned out to be of considerable dimensions, he found a motor-car

standing near it, and Barracombe walking up and down.
"Well, old man," said Barracombe, as Smith alighted; "they call me a

hustler, but you've hustled me this time. What in the world are you

after?"
"Have you got the stuff?" returned Smith with the curtness of an old

friend.
"Yes; chocolate, bovril, the whole boiling; but—"
"And the maps?"
"And the maps. A nice job I had to get them. All the shops were

shut, of course. I stole 'em."
"Played the burglar?"
"No. I went to the Royal Societies' Club, and pinched them out of the

library. Posted a cheque to pay for 'em, but there was nobody about

and I couldn't stop for red tape."
"Well, you're a big enough man to do such things with impunity. That's

why I 'phoned you: knew you'd do it somehow."
Although Barracombe was a potentate in the city, who controlled

immense organizations, and held the threads of multifarious interests,

he was very human at bottom, and Smith liked him all the better for

the glow of self-satisfaction that shone upon his face at this tribute

to his omnipotence.
"But now, what's it all mean, you beggar? Are you off to reorganize

the Turkish navy or something?"
"I'm off to the Solomon Islands."
"What!"
"That's it: going to have a shot at helping the poor old governor."
"But, my dear fellow, he'll either be relieved or done for long before

you can get there. The paper said they were practically unarmed."
"Exactly. I'm going to pick up some rifles and ammunition at one of

the Australian ports, and so help 'em to keep their end up until the

gunboat reaches them. I'll probably get there a day before the boat."
"But do you know how far it is? It's thirteen thousand miles or more."
"I know. I'm going to have a try. I've got seven days to get there and

back; then my leave's up. I can do it if the engine holds out, and if

you'll help."
"My dear chap, you know I'll do anything I can, but—well, upon my

soul, you take my breath away. I'm not often surprised, but—what are

you grinning at?"
"At having knocked the wind out of your sails for once, old man.

Seriously, we've thought it out, Roddy and I. We've more than once

done a speed of a hundred and ninety. Of course it's a different

matter to keep it up for days on end, but how long have you had your

motor-car?"
"Three months. Why?"
"And how often has it broken down?"
"Not at all; but I haven't done thirteen thousand miles at a go."
"You've done more, with stoppages. Well, I shall have stoppages—just

long enough to clean and take in petrol and oil, and that's where I

want your help. I want you to arrange for eighty gallons of petrol and

sixteen of oil, to be ready for me at three places besides

Constantinople. Here's the list; Karachi, Penang, and Port Darwin.

Could you cable me to the address in Constantinople the names of firms

at those places?"
"Of course. I'll look 'em up the first thing in the morning."
"Too late. It must be done to-night. If all goes well I shall be in

Constantinople soon after eight to-morrow—our time; and I must leave

there in a couple of hours if I'm to stick to my programme."
"Very well. I'll look out some names as soon as I get back to town.

You mean to keep me up all night. There you are, man; it's absurd; you

can't drive night and day for seven days without sleep."
"Roddy and I shall have to take watch and watch."
"But suppose you're caught in a storm; suppose the engine breaks down

when you're over the sea—"
"My dear chap, if we fall into the sea we shan't hurt ourselves so

much as if it were land. I've got a couple of lifebuoys. If a storm

comes on, too bad to sail through, we must come down and wait till

it's over. Of course any accident may stop us, even a speck of grit in

the engine; but you're the last man in the world to be put off a thing

by any bogey of what-might-be, and I'm going to look at the bright

side. It's time I was off, so I'll take the things you've

brought—oh, I see Roddy has already shipped them, so I'll get

aboard."
"Well, I wish you all the luck in the world. Send me a wire when you

land, will you, so that I may know how you are getting on."
"If I have time. Good-bye, old man; many thanks."
They shook hands, and Smith was just about to jump into his seat when

there came the sound of galloping horses, and the incessant clanging

of a bell. Smith laughed.
"Your blaze has roused the Epsom Fire Brigade," he said with a

chuckle.
"Well, I thought I'd better make a big one to make sure of you,"

replied Barracombe.
Smith waited with his hand on the lever until the fire-engine had

dashed up.
"What the blazes!" cried the captain, as he leapt from his seat,

looking from the motor-car to the aeroplane with mingled amazement and

indignation.
"Good-bye, Billy," cried Smith; "I'll leave you to explain."
The propeller whirled round, the machine flew forwards, and in a few

seconds was soaring with its booming hum into the air. Smith glanced

down and saw the fireman facing Barracombe, his annoyance being

evidently greater than his curiosity. He would have smiled if he

could have heard Barracombe's explanation.
"W-w-why yes," he said, affecting a distressing stutter; "this kind of

b-b-bonfire is a hobby of m-mine; it's about my only r-r-recreation.

M-m-my name? Certainly. My name's William bub-bub-Barracombe, and

you'll find me in, any day between t-ten and f-five, at 532

mum-mum-Mincing Lane."

CHAPTER III
ACROSS EUROPE TO THE BOSPHOROUS
 
It had just turned half-past twelve on Friday morning when Smith said

  good-bye to his friend William Barracombe on Epsom Downs. The sky was

  clear; the moon shone so brightly that by its light alone he could

  read the compass at his elbow, without the aid of the small electric

  lamp that hung above it. He set his course for the south-east, and

  flew with a light breeze at a speed of at least two hundred miles an

  hour.
His machine was a biplane, and represented the work and thought of

years. Smith never minimized the part which Laurent Rodier had had in

its construction; indeed, he was wont to say that without Rodier he

would have been nowhere. Their acquaintance and comradeship had begun

in the most accidental way. Two years before, Smith was taking part in

an aeroplane race from Paris to London. On reaching the Channel, he

found himself far ahead of all his competitors, except a Frenchman,

who, to his chagrin, managed to keep a lead of almost a mile. Each

carried a passenger. Not long after leaving the French coast, a cloud

of smoke suddenly appeared in the wake of the Frenchman's aeroplane,

and to Smith's alarm the machine in a few seconds dropped into the

sea. Instantly he steered for the spot, and brought his own aeroplane

to within a few feet of the water. To his surprise, he saw that part

of the wreckage was floating, and a man, apparently only half

conscious, was clinging to one of the stays. But for the engine having

providentially become disconnected in the fall, the whole machine with

its passengers must have sunk to the bottom.
Smith saw that it was impossible for him to rescue the man while he

himself remained in his aeroplane, for the slightest touch upon the

other would inevitably have submerged it. There was only one thing to

do. Leaving the aeroplane to the charge of his friend, he dived into

the sea, and rising beside the man, seized him at the moment when his

hold was relaxing, and contrived to hold him up until a fast motor

launch, which had witnessed the accident, came up and rescued them

both.
The man proved to be the chauffeur of the aeroplane; his employer was

drowned. Smith lost the race, but he gained what was infinitely more

valuable to him, the gratitude and devotion of Laurent Rodier. Finding

that the Frenchman was an expert mechanician, Smith took him into his

employment. Rodier turned out to be of a singularly inventive turn of

mind, and the two, putting their heads together, evolved after long

experiment a type of engine that enabled them to double the speed of

the aeroplane. These aerial vessels had already attained a maximum of

a hundred miles an hour, for progress had been rapid since Paulhan's

epoch-making flight from London to Manchester. To the younger

generation the aeroplane was becoming what the motor-car had been to

their elders. It was now a handier, more compact, and more easily

managed machine than the earlier types, and the risk of breakdown was

no greater than in the motor-car of the roads. The engine seldom

failed, as it was wont to do in the first years of aviation. The

principal danger that airmen had to fear was disaster from strong

squalls, or from vertical or spiral currents of air due to some

peculiarity in the confirmation of the land beneath them.
Smith's engine was a compound turbine, reciprocating engines having

proved extravagant in fuel. There were both a high and a low pressure

turbine on the same shaft, which also drove the dynamo for the

searchlight and the lamp illuminating the compass, and for igniting

the explosive mixture. By means of an eccentric, moreover, the shaft

worked a pump for compressing the mixture of hot air and petrol before

ignition, the air being heated by passing through jackets round the

high-pressure turbines. The framework of the planes consisted of

hollow rods made of an aluminum alloy of high tensile strength, and

the canvas stretched over the frames was laced with wire of the same

material. To stiffen the planes, a bracket was clamped at the axis,

and thin wire stays were strung top and bottom, as the masts of a

yacht are supported. The airman was in some degree protected from the

wind by a strong talc screen, also wire-laced; by means of this, and a

light radiator worked by a number of accumulators, he was enabled to

resist the cold, which had been so great a drawback to the pioneers of

airmanship.
In this aeroplane Smith and Rodier had made many a long expedition.

They had found that the machine was capable of supporting a total

weight of nearly 1,200 lbs., and since Smith turned the scale at

eleven stone eight, and Rodier at ten stone, in their clothes, the

total additional load they could carry was about 900 lbs. Eighty

gallons of petrol weighed about 600 lbs. with the cans, and twenty

gallons of lubricating oil about 160 lbs., so that there was a margin

of nearly 150 lbs. for food, rifles, and anything else there might be

occasion for carrying at any stage of the journey.
Smith was in charge of the aeroplane attached to his ship, the

Admiralty having adopted the machine for scouting purposes. It was

only recently that he had brought his own aeroplane to its present

perfection, after laborious experiments in the workshops he

established in the corner of his father's park, where he toiled

incessantly whenever he could obtain leave, and where Rodier was

constantly employed. His machine had just completed its trials, and he

expected to realize a considerable sum by his improvements. Of this he

had agreed to give Rodier one half, and the Frenchman had further

stipulated that the improvements should be offered also to the French

Government. This being a matter of patriotism, Smith readily

consented, remarking with a laugh that he would not be the first to

break the entente cordiale.
Just as a voyage round the world was a dream until Drake accomplished

it, so a flight round the world was the acme of every airman's

ambition. It was the accident of his father's plight that crystallized

in Smith's mind the desires held in suspension there. The act was

sudden: the idea had been long cherished.
He had decided on his course after a careful examination of the globe

borrowed from Mr. Dawkins, the village school-master. The most direct

route from London to the Solomon Islands ran across Norway and Sweden,

the White Sea, Northern Siberia, Manchuria, Korea and Japan, and

thence to New Guinea. But since it traversed some of the most desolate

regions of the earth, where the indispensable supplies of petrol and

machine oil could not be secured, he had chosen a route through fairly

large centres of population, along which at the necessary intervals he

could ensure, by aid of the telegraph, that the fuel would be in

readiness.
And now he was fairly off. Constantinople was to be the first place of

call. He knew the orographical map of Europe as well as he knew his

manual of navigation. It was advisable to avoid mountainous country as

far as possible, for the necessity of rising to great heights, in

order to cross even the lower spurs of the Alps, would involve loss of

time, to say nothing of the cold, and the risk of accident in the

darkness. Coming to the coast, in the neighbourhood of Dover, about

half-an-hour after leaving Epsom, he steered for a point on the

opposite shore of the Channel somewhere near the Franco-Belgian

frontier. As an experienced airman he had long ceased to find the

interest of novelty in the scenes below him. The lights of the Calais

boat, and of vessels passing up and down the Channel, were almost

unnoticed. On leaving the sea, he flew over a flat country until, on

his right, he saw in the moonlight a dark mass which from dead

reckoning he thought must be the Ardennes. The broad river he had just

crossed, which gleamed like silver in the moonlight, was without doubt

the Meuse, and that which he came to in about an hour must be the

Moselle. At this point Rodier, who had been dozing, sat up and began

to take an interest in things; afterwards he told Smith that they must

have passed over the little village in which he was born, and he felt

a sentimental regret that the flight was not by day, when he might

have seen the red roof beneath which his mother still lived.
After another half-hour Smith began to feel the strain of remaining in

one position, with all his faculties concentrated. The air was so

calm, and the wind-screen so effective, that he suffered none of the

numbing effects which the great speed might otherwise have induced;

but it was no light task to keep his attention fixed at once on the

engine, the map outspread before him, the compass, and the country

below; and by the time he reached a still broader river, which could

only be the Rhine, he was tired. As yet he had been flying for only

three hours: could he live through seven days of it? He had once

crossed America in the Canadian Pacific, and though he got eight

hours' sleep every night, he felt an utter wreck at the end of the journey. To be sure, he was now in the fresh air instead of a stuffy

railway carriage, and he was riding as smoothly as on a steamer,

without the jar and jolt that made journeys by rail so fatiguing.

Still, he thought it only good policy to pay heed to the first signs

of strain, and so he slowed down until the noise of the engine had

abated sufficiently for him to make his voice heard, and said:
"Roddy, you must take a turn. We're near the frontier between Baden

and Alsace, I fancy. The Bavarian hills can't be far off. You had

better rise a bit, and don't go too fast, or we may be knocking our

noses before we know where we are."
"Right O, mister," replied the Frenchman. "You take forty winks, and

eat some chocolate for what you call a nightcap."
"A good idea. I'd rise to about 4,500 feet, I think. Keep your eye on

the aneroid."
They exchanged places. Smith ate two or three sticks of chocolate,

took a good drink of water, and in five minutes was fast asleep. But

his nap lasted no more than a couple of hours. It appeared to him that

he never lost consciousness of his errand. When he opened his eyes the

dawn was already stealing over the sky, and at the tremendous pace to

which Rodier had put the engine the aeroplane seemed to rush into the

sunlight. Far below, the earth was spread out like a patchwork, greens and whites and browns set in picturesque haphazard patterns;

men moving like ants, and horses like locusts.
"Where are we?" he bawled in Rodier's ear.
The Frenchman put his finger on the map. Smith glanced at his watch;

it was past five o'clock. They must be near the Servian frontier. That

broad streak of blue must be the Danube. Another three hours should

see them at Constantinople, the first stage of their journey. On they

rushed, feeling chill in the morning air at the height of nearly five

thousand feet. Lifting his binocular, Smith saw a railway train

running in the same direction as themselves, and though from the line

of smoke it was going at full speed, it appeared to be crawling like a

worm, and was soon left far behind. Now they were in Bulgaria: those

grey crinkly masses beyond must be the Balkans. Crossing the Dragoman

Pass, they came into an upward current of air that set the machine

rocking, and Smith for the first time felt a touch of nervousness lest

it should break down and fall among these inhospitable crags. Rodier

planed downwards, until they seemed to skim the crests. The air was

calmer here: the aeroplane steadied; and when the mountains were left

behind they came still lower, following the railway line.
Here was Philippopolis, with its citadel perched on a frowning rock.

It seemed but a few minutes when Adrianople came into view, and but a

few more when, descending to within five hundred feet of the ground,

they raced over the plains of St. Stefano. Now Rodier checked the

speed a little, and steering past the large monument erected to the

memory of the Russians who fell in '78, came within sight of

Constantinople. Smith was bewildered at the multitude of domes,

minarets, and white roofs before him. It would soon be necessary to

choose a landing-place, and Rodier planed upwards, so that he could

scan the whole neighbourhood in one comprehensive glance.
"Slow down!" Smith shouted.
There was a large open space below him; it was the Hippodrome. He made

a quick calculation of its length, and decided not to alight. A little

farther on he came to the Ministry of War with its large square; but

there a regiment of soldiers was drilling. Rodier steered a point to

the north-west, and the aeroplane passed over the Galata bridge that

spans the Golden Horn. The bridge was thronged with people, who, as

they caught sight of the strange machine flying over their heads,

stood and craned their necks, and the airmen heard their shouts of

amazement. To the right they saw, beyond the hill of Pera, a stretch

of low open country. Passing the second bridge over the Horn, they

came to a broad green space just without the city. It was the old

archery grounds of the Sultans.
"Dive, Roddy!" Smith cried.
Rodier jerked the lever back: the humming clatter of the engine

ceased; and the aeroplane swooped down as gracefully as a bird,

alighting gently on the green sward.

CHAPTER IV
A FLYING VISIT
 
It was Friday morning. Groups of Turkish women, out for the day,

  hastily veiled their faces and ran away, shrieking, "Aman! Aman! oh

  dear! oh dear!" Swarms of children, clustering, like ants, about

  nougat-sellers, fled in terror, screaming that it was the devil's

  carriage, and the devil was in it. Two Greek teams playing at football

  stopped their game and gazed open-mouthed; young naval cadets at

  leapfrog rushed with shouts of excitement towards the aeroplane; and a

  crowd of Jewish factory girls (for all races and classes use this

  common playground), realizing with quick wit what it meant, flocked up

  with shrill cries: "C'est un aviateur: allons voir!" A grave old Turk

  mutters: "Another mad Englishman!" A Greek shouts: "Come on, Pericles,

  and have a look"; and suddenly, amid the babel of unknown tongues

  Smith hears an unmistakable English voice: "Oh, confound it all,

  Crawford, I'm in the ravine."
Peering through the crowd of inquisitive faces, Smith sees two golfers

and hails them heartily. They elbow their way through, and Smith, who

has not yet dared to leave the machine lest the mob should invade it

and do it an injury, steps out and grasps the hand of a fellow

Englishman.
"Well, I'm hanged!" cried the new-comer; "Charley Smith, of all men in

the world."
"Hullo, Johnson!" said Smith, recognizing in the speaker a messmate of

his middy days, now a naval officer in the Sultan's service; "I say,

you can do something for me."
"I dare say I can," replied the other laughing, "but where do you

spring from? I didn't know you were in these parts."
"Only arrived five minutes ago, from London."
Johnson stared.
"Not in that machine?"
"Yes, certainly. Eight hours' run; a record, isn't it? But I'm short

of petrol. There's some ordered by wire from a man named Benzonana;

can you put me in the way of getting it quickly?"
"Of course. Benzonana's a Jew, with stores at Kourshounlou Han. But

there's no hurry. We'll get some one to look after your aeroplane, and

you'll come back with me to the club: this sort of thing doesn't

happen every day, old man. By Jove! Do you really mean to say you've

got here in eight hours from London?"

 THE CAPTAIN LOOKED SUSPICIOUSLY FROM THE TWO GRIMY TRAVELLERS TO THE SPICK-AND-SPAN ENGLISHMAN.
The captain looked suspiciously from the two grimy travellers to the spick-and-span Englishman.

"I left there at 12.35 this morning. Barracombe—you remember him—saw

me off. But I'm sorry I can't come with you, Dick. I've only a couple

of hours to spare, and must get the petrol at once."
"My dear chap, are you mad? You can't go on at once, after eight hours

in the air. You'll crock up. Of course, if it's a wager—"
"It's a matter of life and death."
"Oh, in that case! But I'm afraid you won't get off in two hours.

Things go slow in this country, and here's the first obstacle."
He pointed beyond the crowd, and Smith saw a troop of cavalry

approaching at a hand-gallop. The throng of Turks, Jews, and

Armenians, who had all this time been volubly discussing the wonderful

devil machine, broke apart with shouts of "Yol ver! Yol ver!" (Make

way!) The troop of horsemen clattered up, and Smith saw himself and

his aeroplane surrounded by a cordon of soldiers.
The captain looked suspiciously from the two grimy travellers to the

spick-and-span Englishmen in golfing costume. He said something in

Turkish to his lieutenant.
"What does he say?" asked Smith in a whisper.
"He's telling the lieutenant they must draw up a procès-verbal.

Don't lose your temper, old man; he talks of putting you under arrest

as a Bulgarian spy. You'll have to be patient. I'll do what I can,

but if they make a diplomatic incident of it you'll be kept here a

week or more."
Johnson went up to the captain and addressed him politely in Turkish.

The officer looked incredulous, and said something to his lieutenant,

who trotted off across the field. In a few minutes Johnson returned to

Smith, who was walking up and down in agitation. Rodier was fast

asleep in the car of the aeroplane.
"I've given the captain the facts of the case," said Johnson, "and he

does me the honour to disbelieve me. The lieutenant has gone off to

the Ministry of War for instructions. Meanwhile, you are under arrest,

and they won't let you quit this spot without authority. If you really

mean that you must go at once——"
"I do indeed. The loss of an hour may ruin everything. My plan was to

leave here at 10.30."
"But, my dear fellow, it's that now, and past."
Smith drew out his watch: it indicated 8.50. "London time," he said.

"You're two hours in advance of it, aren't you?"
Johnson laughed.
"Of course, we get used to our own time, here. But I was saying, if

you must go, this is what I suggest. You can't appear, and it's as

well, for you would certainly be delayed. I will go off to the Embassy

and hustle a bit. If the wheels can be hurried, they shall be, I

assure you. Then I'll go on to Benzonana, get your petrol, and come

straight back. Meanwhile take my advice and have a sleep, like your

man there. You look dead beat, and no wonder. Why, I suppose you've

had no breakfast?"
"I've had something, but not bacon and eggs, certainly. I shall do

very well. I will take your advice; sleep is better than food just

now. When you see Benzonana, ask if he has any addresses for me:

Barracombe was going to wire some from London. Many thanks, old man."
Johnson said a word or two to the captain, who nodded gravely as Smith

flung himself down beside the aeroplane, and, resting his head on his

arms, prepared to go to sleep.
The golfer knew the short cuts from the Ok Meidan to the city. He went

at a fine swinging pace through the hamlet of Koulaksiz, down Cassim

Pasha, up the steep hill through the cemetery, past the Pera Palace

Hotel. At that point he jumped into a carriage, and commanded the

driver to make all speed to the British Embassy. There he was lucky to

find a friend of his on the staff of the Embassy, a man well versed in

the customs and character of the Turks.
"The only thing to do," said the official, when Johnson had briefly

explained the circumstances, "is to get an order from the Minister of

War; but we shall have to hurry, as he may be attending a council, or

a commission, or something of the sort. What is your friend's hurry?"
"I don't know. He says it's a matter of life or death."
"I should say death if he goes at such a preposterous speed. It must

have been nearly two hundred miles an hour: the Brennan mono-rail is

nothing to it. At any rate, it's rather a feather in our cap—this

record, I mean, after so many have been made by the French and the

Americans—and if he has more recording to do we mustn't let Oriental

sluggishness stand in the way."
This conversation passed while they were making their way from an

upper room of the Embassy to the street. There they jumped into an

araba with a kavass on the box, dashed down Pera Street, past the

banking quarter, over the Galata bridge, up the Sublime Porte Road and

into the Bayazid Square, where they reached their destination. A crowd

of servants was grouped about the Grand Entrance, and as Johnson and

his friend Callard came up, the Turks flocked around them officiously,

assuring them with one voice that the Minister was attending a

commission. Callard took no notice of them, but passed on with Johnson

into the central hall, where, sitting over a charcoal brazier, they

found a group of attendants rolling cigarettes and discussing the

merits of the city's new water supply. Among them Callard spotted an

acquaintance, who rose and said politely, "Welcome, dragoman bey, seat

yourself."
Callard knew very well the necessity, in Turkish administrations, of

having a friend at court, and was aware, too, that where a high

official failed, a servant might succeed. But he was too well

acquainted with the customs of the country to attempt to hasten

matters unduly. He began to discuss the weather; he compared the

climate of his interlocutor's province with that of the city; he spoke

of the approaching Bairam festivities. Then, apparently apropos of

nothing, the man said, "I have been at the sheep-market to-day," a

remark which Callard took as a broad hint for bakshish: the Turk

wanted money to buy a fat sheep for the impending sacrifice. He

produced two medjidiés. The effect was magical. The two Englishmen

were guided to the small chamber where the Minister's coat hung, where

his coffee was prepared and his official attendants sat. From this

room access could be had to him without the knowledge of the hundreds

of people outside waiting for an audience: wives of exiled officers,

officials without employment, mothers come to plead for erring sons

who had been dismissed.
Introduced to the Minister's presence, Callard wasted no time. The

case was put to him; Johnson, whom he knew by sight, vouched for the

respectability and good faith of his old comrade; and the Minister,

apologizing for his subordinate's excess of zeal, scribbled an order

permitting Lieutenant Smith to pursue his business free of all

restrictions by the military authorities.
"But," he said, "I have no power to give him exemption from Custom

House control."
The Englishmen thanked him profusely, and with many salaams retired.
"We have succeeded better than I hoped," said Callard, as they passed

out; "but we are still only half way, confound it! We shall have to

hurry up if Smith is to get off in time. Arabadji," he cried to the

coachman awaiting them at the door, "the Direction-General of the

Custom House."
The driver whipped up his horse; they dashed down the Sublime Porte

Hill, and drew up at the entrance to the Custom House.
"Is the Director-General here?" Callard asked of the doorkeeper.
"He is a little unwell, but the English adviser is here."
"We will see him," returned Callard; adding to Johnson, "We are in

luck's way; the English adviser does his best to lessen the

inconveniences of the Circumlocution Office."
They went up-stairs, and were met by an attendant who showed them into

an unpretentious room, where an Englishman, wearing a fez, was seated

at a table covered with papers and surrounded by a crowd of merchants

and officials. Questions of infinite variety were being submitted to

him.
"Excellence, are we to accept as samples two dozen left-hand gloves?

This merchant brought two dozen right-hand gloves last week."
Then the merchant and the official began to wrangle. For some minutes

Callard in vain tried to get a word in edgeways; then at last the

Councillor, pushing back his fez with an air of weary patience, turned

to the newcomers and asked their business. A few words sufficed; the

Councillor rang a bell on the table, and when his secretary appeared,

ordered him to make out a laissez-passer for Lieutenant Smith for

all the Custom Houses of the Empire. This done, he turned once more to

listen to the interminable dispute about the left-hand gloves.
"We are doing well," said Callard, as the two left the Custom House.

"There's still nearly an hour to spare. Now for the petrol."
They drove across the Galata bridge to the district of Kourshounlou

Han, and found that Benzonana had had the petrol ready at early

morning, and, what was more, had it at that moment in a conveyance for

transport. Johnson asked him if he had received any addresses from

London, and the man handed him a folded paper. Then, asking him to

send the petrol and some machine oil at once to the Ok Meidan, the two

Englishmen reentered their carriage, dashed up the Maltese Street,

past the Bank and the Economic Stores, up the Municipality Hill, and

again down by a short cut to the Admiralty. It was an hour and a half

since Johnson had set forth on his errand.
They found Smith and Rodier talking to the second golfer, boiling

coffee in a little portable stove, and eating a kind of shortbread

they had purchased of one of the simitdjis or itinerant vendors of

that article who had been doing a roaring trade with the children, and

even the elders, among the sightseers.
"Don't taste bad, spread with Bovril," said Smith, as Johnson and

Callard alighted from their carriage.
The crowd had grown to immense proportions. Smith said they had been

clamouring ever since Johnson had been gone, and he would rather like

to know what they said.
"Probably discussing whether the Commander of the Faithful won't order

you to be flung into the Bosphorus," said Callard.
The soldiers were still on guard round the aeroplane. Johnson

approached the captain and showed him the Minister of War's order.

Almost at the same moment an aide-de-camp came galloping up from the

Minister himself to assure the officer that all was right.
"But don't go yet, captain," said Johnson anxiously. "My friend will

require a clear space for starting his aeroplane, and without your men

we shall never get the crowd back."
The officer agreed to wait until the Englishman departed, and Johnson

returned to Smith to give him the paper he had received from

Benzonana. Callard had already related their experiences at the

Ministry of War and the Custom House.
"But what about the petrol?" asked Smith. "Time's getting on."
"He said he had it all ready to send. Ah! I guess this is it coming."
A way was parted through the crowd, and there came up with great

rattling and creaking a heavy motor omnibus of the type that first

appeared on the streets of London. It was crowded within and without

with Turks young and old.
"Where did you get that old rattler?" asked Smith, laughing.
"Oh, several came out here a year or two ago; bought up cheap when the

Commissioner of Police couldn't stand 'em any longer. They're always

breaking down. No doubt your petrol is inside, and you may think

yourself lucky it has got here."
The car came to a stand: the Turks on the roof retained their places;

those within lugged out the cans of petrol and oil, and placed them in

the aeroplane at Rodier's direction. Smith meanwhile was chatting with

the Englishmen, fending off their questions as to his destination.
"I may send you a wire from my next stopping-place," he said. "That

reminds me. Will you send a wire to Barracombe for me, Johnson? You

know his address. And one to my sister at home. I promised I would let

her know. Simply say 'All well.' Now can you get the captain to clear

the course for me?"
The captain and his men took a long time over this business, and Smith

longed for a few London policemen to show them how to do it. But the

excited crowd was at length forced back so far as to allow a

sufficient running-off space. Smith shook hands warmly with the

Englishmen; with Rodier he took his place in the car; then at a jerk

of the lever the aeroplane shot forward, and, amid cries of "Good

luck!" from the Englishmen, clapping of hands and loud "Mashallahs!"

from the excited mob, it rose gracefully into the air.
"Only five minutes late, mister," said Rodier. "All goes well."

CHAPTER V
THE TOMB OF UR-GUR
 
Charles Thesiger Smith was not one of the romantic, imaginative order

  of men. Even if he had been, the speed at which he travelled over the

  Bosphorus gave scant opportunity for observation of the scenes passing

  below. He had no eye for the tramps, laden with grain from Odessa,

  coming down from the Black Sea; for the vessels of ancient shape and

  build, such as the Argonauts might have sailed in when questing for

  the Golden Fleece; for the graceful caiques rowed by boatmen in

  zouaves of crimson and gold, in the sterns of which the flower of

  Circassian beauty in gossamer veils reclined on divans and carpets

  from the most famous looms of Persia and Bokhara. These visions

  touched him not: he was crossing into Asia Minor, a country of which

  he knew nothing, and his attention was divided between the country

  ahead and the map with which Barracombe had nefariously provided him.
The next stage of his journey, the first place where a fresh supply of

petrol awaited him, was Karachi, in the north-west corner of India. It

was distant about 2,500 miles. A gallon of petrol would carry him for

forty-five miles, and his tank had a capacity of eighty gallons, so

that with good luck he would not need to replenish it until he reached

Karachi. Though he hoped that his own endurance and the engine's would

stand the strain of the whole distance without stopping, he had chosen

his course so that, if he felt the necessity of alighting for brief

intervals, he might at least find pleasant country and amicable

people.
His aim was to cross the Turkish provinces in Asia and strike the

Persian Gulf, a slightly longer route than if he had gone through

central Persia, but having the great advantage of affording a possible

half-way house at Bagdad, Basra, or Bushire, in each of which towns he

would almost certainly find Europeans. It had the further advantage

that, when he had once sighted the Gulf, he would have no anxiety

about the accuracy of his course, since by keeping generally to the

coastline of Persia and Baluchistan he could not fail to arrive at

Karachi. It was a great thing to be independent of nautical

observations, for as he approached the shores of India it might be

difficult to take his bearings by his instruments, this being the

season of the monsoon.
When he left Constantinople his anemometer indicated a velocity of

eighteen miles in the south-west wind, which, as he was steering

south-east, was partly in his favour. One of the disabilities which

he, in common with all airmen, suffered, was the impossibility of

ascertaining the velocity of the wind when he was fairly afloat. He

had to make allowance for it by sheer guesswork, unless he was

prepared to slow down or even to alight. He had reckoned that, even

with the slight assistance of the wind, he could hardly hope to reach

the head of the Persian Gulf before six o'clock, which would be past

nine by the sun; but he thought he might reasonably expect to reach

the Euphrates before sunset; and since the map assured him that that

river ran a fairly direct course to the Gulf, he might follow it

without much difficulty if the night proved clear, and so assure

himself that he was not going astray.
The country over which he was now flying was hilly, and he kept at a

fairly high altitude. The map showed him that the great Taurus range

lay between him and the eastern extremity of the Mediterranean. Within

an hour and a half after leaving Constantinople he came in sight of

its huge bleak masses stretching away to right and left, but still a

hundred miles or more distant, although, on the right, spurs of the

Cilician part of the range jutted out much nearer to him. On the

right, too, he descried from his great height a broad and glittering

expanse of water, which the map named Lake Beishehr. Making for the

gap in the mountains near the Cilician coast he found himself passing

over a comparatively low country, and soon afterwards descried the

blue waters of the Mediterranean and the island of Cyprus rising out

of it a hundred miles away.
Setting now a more easterly course, he passed over an ironbound coast,

its perpendicular cliffs fringed with dwarf pines; and then over a

large town which could be none other than Antioch. Half-an-hour more

brought him within sight of another city, doubtless Aleppo. He still

steered almost due east, though a point or two southward would be more

direct, because he wished to avoid the Syrian desert; a breakdown in

such a barren tract of country would mean a fatal delay. Soon

afterwards he reached a broad full river, flowing rapidly between

verdant banks.
"The Euphrates," he shouted to Rodier.
"Ah! I wish we had time for a swim," replied the man.
For some time Smith followed the general course of the river, avoiding

the windings. Severely practical as he was, he could not pass through

this seat of ancient civilizations without letting his mind run back

over centuries of time, recalling the names of Sennacherib, Cyrus and

Alexander; and how Cyrus had not shrunk from drying up the bed of

this very river in his operations against Babylon. On the ground over

which he now flew mighty armies had fought, kingdoms had been lost and

won, four or five thousand years ago. The passage of so modern a thing

as an aeroplane seemed almost a desecration of the spirit of

antiquity, an insult to the genius loci.
Hitherto the weather and the conditions for flying had been perfect.

The wind had dropped, the sun shone brilliantly, but its heat was

tempered to the airmen by the very rapidity of their flight. At

length, however, about two hours before sunset, Smith noticed a

strange wobbling of the compass needle. It swung this way and that

with rapid gyrations, its movements becoming more violent every

moment. Suddenly the aeroplane reeled; the sky seemed to become black

in one instant; there was a vivid flash of lightning, followed by a

tremendous thunder-clap and a flood of rain.
Smith was desperately perturbed. He had run straight into an electric

storm. It was hopeless to attempt to make headway against it; the

strain upon the planes would certainly prove more than they could

stand. He had already slackened speed and planed downwards, so as to

be able to alight if he must, with the result that the machine became

more subject to vertical eddies of the wind, that continually altered

its elevation, now hurling it aloft, now plunging it as it were into

an abyss. Once or twice he tried to rise above the storm, but

abandoned the attempt when he saw how great an additional strain it

placed upon the planes. It seemed safer to keep the engine going

steadily and make no attempt to steer. He was no longer over the

river, and the ground below was comparatively flat, presenting many a

clear spot suitable for alighting; but with the wind blowing a

hurricane a descent might well prove disastrous. The worst accidents

he had suffered in the early days of his air-sailing had always

happened near the ground, when there was no way on the machine to

counteract the force of the wind.
All that he could do was to cling on and do his best by quick

manipulation of the levers to keep the machine steady. After fifteen

very uncomfortable and, indeed, alarming minutes, the violence of the

wind abated, and the rain became intermittent, instead of pouring down

in a constant flood. The compass was oscillating less jumpily, and it

was now possible to see some distance ahead. Owing to the

extraordinary behaviour of the compass, the baffling gusts of wind,

and the necessity of keeping his whole attention fixed on the

machinery, he had lost all idea of direction and even of time, and he

began to be anxious lest darkness should overtake him before he had

regained his course. But guessing that the area of the storm was of

small extent, he hoped to run out of it, and increased his speed,

expecting in a few minutes to discover the Euphrates again, when all

would be well.
Unhappily, though the wind had dropped, the sky became blacker than

ever, and another deluge of rain fell, so densely that at a distance

of a few yards it seemed to be an opaque wall. Coming to the

conclusion that he had better take shelter until he could at least see

his way, he planed downwards, calling to Rodier to keep a sharp

look-out for a landing place. Suddenly, in the midst of the downpour,

a huge dark shape loomed up ahead, appearing to rise almost

perpendicularly above the plain. For a few seconds it seemed to Smith

that he was dashing into a solid wall of rock. Luckily he had checked

the speed of the engine. He now stopped it altogether, but the

aeroplane glided on by its impetus, and he felt, with a sinking of the

heart, that nothing could save it.
All at once the mass in front seemed to open. Instinctively Smith

touched his steering lever; the aeroplane glided into the fissure; in

two or three seconds there was a bump and a jolt; it had come to a

stop, and was resting on an apparently solid bottom.
Monsieur Alphonse Marie de Montausé, a distinguished member of the

Academy of Inscriptions, a pillar of the Société d'Histoire

diplomatique, and a foreign member of the Royal Society, had been for

nearly a year engaged at Nimrud in the work nearest to his heart, the

work of excavation. It was a labour of love for which he was very

jealous. He believed it was his mission to reveal to an astonished

world the long-buried secrets of ancient civilizations; he could not

bear a rival near the throne of archæological eminence; and in this

exclusive attitude of mind he had undertaken this expedition without

the companionship of a fellow-countryman, or even of any white man,

devoting himself to his patient and laborious toil, assisted only by

an Egyptian cook, a number of Arab labourers, and such natives of

Babylonia as he had attracted to his service by the promise,

faithfully kept, of good and regular pay.
His excavations had been, on the whole, disappointing. He had

unearthed specimens of pottery and metal-work, tradesmen's tablets of

accounts, seals, bas-reliefs, differing little from those which could

be found in many a European museum; but he had not for many months

lighted upon any unique object, such as would open a new page in the

history of archæological research, and make Europe ring with his name.
His money was nearly all expended; his permit from the Ottoman

Government was on the point of expiring; he was sadly contemplating

the necessity of leaving this barren field and returning to France;

he had, indeed, already despatched a portion of his caravan to begin

its long journey to the coast, remaining with a few men to finish the

excavation of the tell—the mound covering the remains of a

Babylonish city—on which he was engaged, in the hope of discovering

something of value, even at the eleventh hour. He had almost completed

it, and he could easily hurry after the slow-moving caravan, and

overtake it in a day or two.
One Friday, to his great joy, he came across, in the wall of the

tell, a large inscribed mass of brickwork, weighing, perhaps,

half-a-ton, which, from the cursory inspection he was able to make of

it in the semi-darkness, he believed might prove sufficiently valuable

to compensate all the disappointments of the weary months. In his

enthusiasm he had no more thought of his caravan, and though a

terrific thunderstorm burst over the place just as his men were

getting into position the rude derrick by means of which they would

lower the masonry into the trench cut in the side of the tell, his

ardour would suffer no intermission in the work. It is true that in

the trench they were in some measure protected from the storm. The

lashings had been fixed on the brickwork under his careful

superintendence; the men were on the point of hauling on the ropes,

when a thing of monstrous size and uncouth shape glided silently into

the opening of the trench, and came to rest there.
Instantly the men gave a howl of terror, released the ropes, and took

to their heels. Monsieur Alphonse Marie de Montausé was left alone.
Remembering that he was an explorer, an enthusiast, and a Frenchman,

the reader will hardly need to be told that Monsieur de Montausé was

beside himself with fury. The dropping of the ropes had caused the

masonry to fall against one of the feet of the derrick, and it came

down with a crash. But this was not the worst. In the semi-darkness,

the nature of the intruder could not have been clear to Monsieur de

Montausé; but he heard a voice calling in some unknown tongue; some

human being had dared to interlope upon his peculiar domain; and the

wrathful explorer did only what might have been expected of him: he

began to pour forth a torrent of very violent reproof and objurgation,

to which the sober English tongue can do scant justice.
"Ah! scélérats!" he cried. "What do you mean? De quoi mêlez-vous? You

are rogues: you are trespassers. Know you not that I—oui, moi qui

vous parle—have alone the right of entry into this tell? Has not

the administration of the French Republic arranged it? Allez-vous-en,

allez-vous-en, coquins, scélérats!"
"Mais, monsieur—" began Rodier, stepping out of the car.
The sound of his own language only added fuel to Monsieur de

Montausé's wrath. Had some rival appeared on the scene at the very

moment when he saw the crown of his long toil? Had some overeager

competitor obtained a permit, come before his time, and arrived to

enter upon the fruits of his predecessor's labours and rob him of half

his glory? "Mais, monsieur," said Rodier, but the explorer fairly

shrieked him to silence, approached him, smote one fist with the

other, and hurled abuse at him with such incoherent volubility that

Smith, whose French was pretty good, could not make out a word of it,

and held on to the levers in helpless laughter.
"Mais, monsieur, je vous assure—" began Rodier again, when he thought

he saw a chance; but the explorer shouted "Retirez-vous! J'insiste que

vous vous en lliez, tout de suite, tout de suite!" And then he began

over again, abuse, recrimination, expostulation, entreaty, pouring in

full tide from his trembling lips. More than once Rodier tried to stem

the flood, but finding that it only ran the faster, he resigned

himself to listen in silence, and stood looking mournfully at his

ireful fellow-countryman until he at length was forced to stop from

sheer lack of breath.
"Mais, monsieur," Rodier's voice was very conciliatory—"I assure you

that our visit is purely accidental. My friend and myself desire only

too much to quit the scene. But you perceive, monsieur, that our

aeroplane—"
"Ah, bah! aeroplane! What have I to do with aeroplanes? You interrupt

my work, I say: the aeroplane is a thing of the present; I have to do

only with the past; there were no aeroplanes in Babylonia. Once more I

demand that you withdraw, you and your aeroplane, and leave me to

pursue my work in tranquillity."
"Mais, monsieur, il s'agit précisément de ça! Withdraw: yes,

certainly, at the quickest possible: but how? You perceive that our

aeroplane is so placed that one cannot extricate it without

assistance. If monsieur will be so good as to lend us his

distinguished help, so that we may remove it from this hole—"
"Hole! Mille diables! It is a trench; a trench excavated with many

pains in this tell. As for assistance, I give you none, none

absolutely. You brought your aeroplane here without assistance: then

remove it equally without assistance; immediately: already you waste

too much time."
"Mais, monsieur, our mission is of life or death."
"N'importe, n'importe. I tell you I am quite unmoved. No interest is

superior to that of science—the science of archæology. I tell you I

have just made a discovery of the highest importance. I have but a

short time left; you, you and your ridiculous machine, have scared

away my imbeciles of workmen; they will not return until you have gone

away; the leg of my derrick is smashed; I demand, I beseech, I

implore—"
"Pardon, monsieur," said Smith, coming forward, and courteously

saluting the stout, spectacled little Frenchman, whom he could just

see in the growing darkness. "We regret extremely having put you to

this trouble and inconvenience, and I assure you that but for the

storm we should never have dreamed of entering here, and interrupting

the great work on which you are engaged."
Smith's quiet voice and slow, measured utterance made an instant

impression. A man can hardly rave against a person who remains calm.

Moreover, the Frenchman was mollified by the speaker's evident

appreciation of the value of his work.
"Eh bien, monsieur?" he said courteously.
"I am a seaman, monsieur," proceeded Smith; "my friend here is an

engineer, and between us I have no doubt that we can repair the leg of

your derrick and assist you to place the masonry where you will. All

that I would ask is that you in return will help us to remove our

aeroplane from your trench into the open plain."
"Certainly, certainly; with much pleasure," said the Frenchman

eagerly; "I will light my lantern, so that we may see what we are

about."
Smith and Rodier stripped off their drenched coats, and by the light

of Monsieur de Montausé's lantern soon spliced up the broken leg of

the derrick, set the contrivance in a stable position, and lowered the

mass of brickwork to the spot the explorer pointed out. It was no

sooner safely settled than Monsieur de Montausé, oblivious of

everything else, bent over it, and, holding one of the lanterns close

to the inscription, began to pore over the fascinating hieroglyphics.

Smith could not help smiling at the little man's enthusiasm: but it

was necessary to remind him of his share of the compact.
"Ah, oui, oui," he said impatiently; "in a few moments. This is a

magnificent discovery, monsieur; your aeroplane is completely

uninteresting to me. This is nothing less than a portion of the tomb

of Ur-Gur; see, the inscription: 'The tomb of Ur-Gur, the powerful

champion, King of Ur, King of Shumer and Akkad, builder of the wall of

Nippur to Bel, the king of the lands.' This was written nearly five

thousand years ago; what is the aeroplane, a thing of yesterday, in

comparison with this glorious relic of antiquity?"
"Precisely, monsieur; beside it the aeroplane sinks into

insignificance; yet, as a man of honour—"
"Ah, oui!" cried the Frenchman, starting up. "Let us be quick, then;

you take one end, I the other. You push, I pull; voilà!"
"It is perhaps not so simple, monsieur," said Smith; "we must first

see that there is no obstruction, and then if you could persuade some

of your men to come back, we should be able to remove the aeroplane

more quickly. I fear we could hardly do it alone."
Monsieur de Montausé was so anxious to get rid of his visitors that he

assented eagerly to this course. Four or five of the men, drawn back

by the light of the lantern, were hovering at the end of the trench;

the explorer hailed them, and assuring them that they would suffer no

harm, persuaded, them to lend a hand. Rodier, meanwhile, had walked

through the trench to see that the course was clear, and shoved aside

with little ceremony some of the objects Monsieur de Montausé had

unearthed. With the aid of the Frenchman himself and his men the

aeroplane was carefully dragged out into the open.
"It is done. Adieu, messieurs," said Monsieur de Montausé. Then,

turning to his men: "As for you, imbeciles, I have no more need of you

at present. Go and eat your supper. I shall eat nothing until I have

deciphered the whole of the inscription."
"One moment, monsieur," said Smith; "we were driven out of our course

by the storm, and I am not certain of our whereabouts. Can you tell me

the latitude and longitude of this place?"
"Ah, no. I am not a geographer. The surface of the globe: bah! It is

the rind of the orange, it is the shell of the nut; I seek the juice,

the kernel. But I can tell you this: We are not far from the left bank

of the Tigris, near its confluence with the Zab, and about a hundred

kilometres from the ruins of Nineveh. Adieu, monsieur."
The two airmen resumed their coats, switched on their searchlight, and

made a rapid examination of the engine, which appeared to have

suffered no injury: then took their places. When the sparking began,

and noisome smoke poured from the exhaust, the workmen again yelled,

but as the machine, after a short run, sailed noisily into the air,

they fell prostrate in utter consternation.

CHAPTER VI
WITH GUN RUNNERS IN THE GULF
 
A glance at the sodden map showed Smith that he had been driven at

  least fifty miles out of his course. He could not afford time to

  return to the Euphrates: he would now have to follow the course of the

  Tigris until it joined the larger river. It would be folly to attempt

  a direct flight to Karachi, for in so doing he would have to pass over

  the mountainous districts of Southern Persia and Baluchistan, where,

  if any mishap befel the aeroplane, there would be absolutely no chance

  of finding assistance. Luckily the moon was rising, and by its light

  he was soon able to strike the Tigris near the spot where it flowed

  between the hills Gebel Hamrin and Gebel Mekhul into the Babylonian

  plain. From this point, keeping the hills well on his left, he steered

  south-east until about midnight he came upon an immense expanse of

  water, shimmering below him in the moonlight, which he concluded to be

  nothing else but the Persian Gulf.
By this time he was both tired and hungry. Rodier and he had eaten a

few biscuits spread with Bovril, and drunk soda-water, while they

were examining the engine, but they both felt ravenous for a good

square meal. Smith, however, had set his heart on completing his

flight to Karachi, where his scheme would allow an hour or two for

rest and food, and he was the more determined to carry out his

programme, if possible, because of the delay caused by the storm.
His plan was to keep close to the left shore of the Persian Gulf, not

following its indentations, but never losing sight of the sea. The

coast, he saw by the map, made a gentle curve for some six hundred

miles, then swept southward opposite the projecting Oman peninsula,

and thence ran almost due east to Karachi. The coast was for the most

part hilly, and as he was now travelling at full speed there was

always a risk, unless he flew high, of his being brought up by a spur

or a rock jutting out into the Gulf; and as he did not wish to

maintain too great an altitude, he altered his course a point or two

to the south, flying over the sea, but not far from the shore.
Rodier and he took turns at the engine, each dozing from sheer

weariness during his spell off. They flew on all through the night,

and when dawn began to break, saw straight ahead land stretching far

to right and left. There was no doubt that this was the Oman

peninsula, which, jutting out from the Arabian mainland, almost closes

the Gulf. Steering now a slightly more northward course, and rising

to clear the hills of the peninsula, Smith passed over the neck of

land, and found himself in the Gulf of Oman, half-way between the head

of the Persian Gulf and Karachi.
Now that it was light, there was no longer the same necessity for

keeping out to sea. Indeed, it was merely prudent to come over the

land, so that if anything happened to the engine he would at least

have an opportunity of descending safely. The engine had worked so

well that he scarcely feared a breakdown, but he was not the man to

take unnecessary risks.
Glancing at his watch, he calculated that he was about two hours

behind time. As he had been flying at full speed except during the

storm, he could hardly hope to make up the lost time except by

diminishing the intervals for rest which he had allowed for before

starting. It was, at any rate, important to lose no more. He had just

come to this conclusion when there was a sudden snap in the framework

of one of the planes. Looking round anxiously, he at once reduced the

speed, feeling very thankful that the mischief had not developed

during the storm, when the aeroplane must have inevitably crumpled up.

Now, however, the weather was fair, and he could choose his

landing-place. He had no doubt that the accident was due to the

enormous strain which had been put upon the structure by the storm. A

glance showed him that the plane was still rigid enough to stand the

strain of motion at a lower speed, but that would neither satisfy him

nor achieve success, and so he decided to alight and try to remedy the

defect.
As he began to plane downwards, Rodier pointed to a cluster of huts at

the mouth of a small river. A dhow lay moored to a rough wooden jetty

beyond the hamlet. Between it and the huts was an open space of

considerable extent, and though when Rodier first drew his attention

to the place they must have been more than a mile distant from it, he

could see, even without his binocular, a crowd of people moving about

the open space.
"We may find a forge there," shouted Rodier.
Smith nodded, but he felt a little uneasy. It seemed likely that he

had now reached what is known as the Mekran coast, and he remembered

the ill reputation it bore with the officers of British ships who had

seen service in these waters. The people had been described as greedy,

conceited, unwilling, and unreasonable as camels, and their

treacherous and cruel disposition was such that, thirty or forty years

before, Europeans who landed on any part of their seaboard would have

done so at great peril. Smith, however, had a vague recollection of

their having been taught a salutary lesson by the Karwan expedition,

and no doubt the presence of British war vessels in the Gulf had done

something to correct their turbulence. He had to choose between

finding a landing-place inland, out of sight of the inhabitants of

this fishing village, and landing among them on the chance of getting

the use of a forge, for it would probably be necessary to weld the

broken stay. Deciding for the latter course, he steered straight for

the village, and, circling round it, dropped gently to earth in the

open space near the jetty.
The aeroplane had been seen and heard some time before it reached the

spot, and its flight was watched with open-mouthed curiosity by the

men, who paused in their work of carrying ashore bulky packages from

the dhow. When they saw the strange visitant from the sky descending

upon them, they gave utterance to shrill cries of alarm, dropped their

burdens, and fled in hot haste up the shore, disappearing behind the

huts. As he alighted, Smith noticed, close to the aeroplane, one of

these packages, which had burst open in the fall, and saw with

surprise that it contained rifles.
"I say, Roddy," he said; "this is rather unlucky. We have interrupted

a gun-running."
"Ah, no, it is lucky, mister," returned the Frenchman. "We shall not

need now to buy rifles en route; we can help ourselves; these are

contraband, without doubt."
"That's true, I suspect; rifles are sure to be contraband here; but

this is a wild district, and the people won't be too well-disposed

towards us, coming and stopping their little game. We've a right to

impound the rifles, I daresay, but I really think we had better look

the other way."
"Wink the other eye, as you say. Well, at present there is no one to

look at. The people do not speak French, I suppose?"
"Nor English, probably. They are Baluchis, I suppose, and perhaps

haven't seen a white man before. Just look and see what's wrong with

the stay while I go up to the village and parley."
Rodier stripped to his shirt, got his tools out of the little box in

which they were kept, and set to work in as unconcerned and

business-like a way as if he had been in the workshop at home.

Meanwhile Smith, puffing at a cigarette, walked slowly towards the

nearest hut. His easy manner gave no sign of alertness; but in reality

he was keeping a keen look-out, and had already descried some of the

natives peeping round the walls of the huts. Having taken a few steps

he halted, looked inquiringly around, and hailed the lurking villagers

with a stentorian "Ahoy!" At first there was no response, but on his

advancing a little farther and repeating the call two or three swarthy

and dirty-looking men came slowly from behind the nearest hut. Smith

noticed the long spears they carried. He smiled and held out his hand,

but the men stopped short and eyed him doubtfully, jabbering among

themselves. He bade them good morning, inviting them to come and have

a talk, but saw at once by the lack of expression on their faces that

they did not understand him.
Somewhat perplexed, and trying to think of signs by which he could

explain what he wanted, he saw a different figure emerge from the

background, a small, bent, olive-skinned old man, clad in a white

turban and dhoti. He came forward hesitatingly.
"Salaam, sahib," he said humbly.
"Oh, I say, can you speak English?" asked Smith eagerly, suspecting

that the man was a Hindu.
"Speak English very fine, sahib," replied the man, with a smile.
"Thank goodness! Well, now, is there a smith in the village? You know

what I mean: a blacksmith, a man who makes iron things?"
It was not a very clear definition, but the Hindu understood him.
"Yees, sahib," he said; "smif that way." He pointed to a hut at a

little distance.
"That's all right. Fetch the smith along, and I'll get you to tell him

what I want."
"I know, sahib, I tell them. I do big trade in this place. They silly

jossers, sahib; think you a djinn."
"Well, put that right, and hurry up, will you?"
The Hindu salaamed and returned to the group of villagers. An excited

colloquy ensued, the man pointing now to the Englishman, now to the

aeroplane, and now to the dhow alongside the jetty. Presently the

Hindu came back.
"Silly chaps say what for you come here, sahib. You know too much,

they say."
Smith guessed that they supposed his visit had something to do with

the smuggling operations in which they were engaged. He explained

quickly that he was merely an ordinary traveller, on his way to India

in one of the new air carriages in which Englishmen were accustomed to

make long journeys, and he promised to pay the smith well for any

assistance he could give in repairing a slight injury which the

carriage had suffered in a storm. The Hindu carried this message to

the villagers, who were now increasing in number as they regained

confidence, and after another discussion he returned, accompanied by a

big man, the dirtiest in the crowd, the others following slowly.
He found it no easy matter, through his smiling but incompetent

interpreter, to explain that he wanted the use of the smith's

appliances. To quicken their apprehension he produced a couple of

half-crowns, pointing out that they were worth four rupees, and

offered these as payment when the work was done. The Hindu recognized

the King's head on the coins, and eagerly assured the Baluchis that

they were good English money; but the smith, true to the oriental

habit of haggling, rejected them scornfully as insufficient, and was

backed up by a chorus of indignant cries from the crowd.
Smith, impatient at the loss of time, and forgetting that any show of

eagerness would merely encourage the natives to delay, was incautious

enough to show them a half-sovereign. Though the Hindu appeared to do

his best to persuade them that this was generous pay, they showed even

greater contempt, and became more and more clamorous.
"Greedy chaps want more, sahib," said the Hindu deprecatingly.
"Very well," replied Smith, pocketing the coin. "We'll do without

them."
He turned his back on them, and returned at a saunter to the

aeroplane, the crowd, now swelled by the arrival of apparently all the

inhabitants of the village, old and young, pressing on behind. It was

evident that they had now lost their fear of the strange machine.
"How are you getting on, Roddy?" he asked. "These asses won't take

half-a-sovereign to lend a hand."
"Imbeciles! But the stay must be welded."
"Well, we'll pretend we can do without 'em. I daresay that will bring

them round."
For a few minutes the two men made a great show of activity,

completely disregarding the crowd curiously watching them. The plan

had the desired effect. The Hindu came forward and said that the smith

would accept the gold piece, if he were paid in advance.
"Not a bit of it. If he likes to help he shall have it when the work

is done," replied Smith, turning to resume his interrupted work.
The smith, now fearful of losing his customer, began to abuse the

Hindu for not completing the bargain. At length, with a show of

reluctance, Smith relented, and with the aid of the villagers the

aeroplane was wheeled to the smithy. It proved to be very poorly

equipped, having a very primitive forge and a pair of clumsy native

bellows; but Rodier set to work to make the best of it, welding the

broken stay with the smith's help, while his employer remained outside

the hut to keep watch over the aeroplane, which the people were

beginning to examine rather more minutely than he liked. To drive them

off, Smith set the engine working, causing a volume of smoke to belch

forth in the faces of the nearest men, who ran back, holding their

noses and crying out in alarm.
Smith filled in the minutes by opening a tin of sardines and eating

some of the fish sandwiched between biscuits. The sight of small fish

brought from a box struck the villagers with amazement, which was

redoubled when he removed the stopper from a soda-water bottle and

drank what appeared to be boiling liquid. Presently, however, he

noticed that some of the men were quietly withdrawing towards the

huts, behind which they disappeared. Among them was the Hindu, who was

apparently summoned, and departed with a look of uneasiness. Smith

went on with his meal unconcernedly, though he was becoming

suspicious, especially when he found by-and-by that all the men had

left him, the crowd consisting now only of women and children.
"Nearly done, Roddy?" he called into the hut.
"Yes, mister. The smith has took his hook, though."
"All the men have gone behind the huts. I wonder what they are up to."
Rodier took up a hammer, and gently broke a hole in the flimsy back

wall of the hut.
"There's a big crowd beyond the village," he reported. "Having a

pow-wow, too. They've got spears and muskets."
"That looks bad. Hurry up with the stay. The sooner we get out of this

the better."
He noticed that the smith had now rejoined the crowd. No doubt he

intended to make sure of getting his money. The mob behind the huts

was growing noisy, and Smith gave a sigh of relief when Rodier came

out with the mended stay and proceeded to fix it in place. While he

did this, Smith beckoned some of the lads forward, and made them

understand by signs that he wished them to help him wheel the

aeroplane round. The slope between it and the sea was very rough

ground, but it afforded space for starting off, and the moment Rodier

had finished his job he swung the aeroplane round and started the

engine. The smith, looking on suspiciously, took this as a signal for

departure and rushed forward, clamouring shrilly for the promised

payment. Smith gave him the half-sovereign, then jumped into his

place, Rodier running beside the machine as it moved down the slope.
At this moment there was a shout from the village, which swelled into

a furious din as the men came rushing from behind the huts, and saw

the white men preparing to leave them. The aeroplane gathered way.

Rodier was on the point of clambering into his place, as he had often

done before, by means of the carriage supporting the wheels. But the

machine jolting over the rough ground delayed him. The yelling crowd

rushed down, some hurling spears, and others endeavouring to seize the

Frenchman. He kept his grip on the rail, but another jolt forced him

to loosen his hold, the machine suddenly sprang upwards, and Rodier

fell backward among his captors.

THE MACHINE SUDDENLY SPRANG UPWARDS, AND RODIER FELL BACKWARD AMONG HIS CAPTORS
The machine suddenly sprang upwards, and Rodier fell backward among his captors.
Smith scarcely realized what had happened until he was many feet in

the air; but seeing at a glance over his shoulder that Rodier was left

behind, he put the helm over and warped the planes to a perilous

degree. The aeroplane was fifty or sixty yards from the starting place

when Smith's action caused it to swerve like a wounded bird; then it

recovered itself, and turning in a narrow circle swept back towards

the confused knot of men on the beach. Smith planed down straight upon

them, intending to land and rush to Rodier's assistance. But

perceiving that the Frenchman was struggling on the ground, with a

dozen turbaned figures clustering over him, he steered straight for

the middle of the group. There was a dull thud, and then another, and

he felt a harsh jolt as the chassis struck some of the standing men.

Smith had stopped the engine when he turned, and the aeroplane,

brought up by this obstruction, sank to the ground, being saved from

damage only by the spring attachments of the carriage.
Drawing his revolver, Smith leapt from his seat and dashed towards the

group. Six or eight men lay on the ground, some of them too badly hurt

to rise; the rest of the crowd had taken to their heels, and the whole

population was in full flight, the children screaming with terror. In

an instant, to Smith's relief, Rodier sprang to his feet. Together

they turned the machine once more towards the sea.
"Are you hurt, Roddy?" asked Smith.
"Ah, the villains! they have given me a dig or two. Let us get away

from this, mister. We are getting later and later."
He jumped into the car; Smith again started the engine; and as the

machine rose into the air it was followed by a howl of rage from the

baffled Baluchis. Half-a-dozen slugs pattered about it, piercing

several holes in the planes. Already one of these had been gashed by a

spear, which still stuck in it. But no serious damage had been done,

and in a few seconds the aeroplane was flying at full speed over the

sea.
It is one of the drawbacks of aerial travel that conversation can only

be carried on in shouts. Smith would have liked to talk over things

with Rodier, but the noise of the engine and the boom of the air as

the machine cut through it smothered his voice unless he bellowed.

Only a few words passed between them as they flew along a little

distance out to sea. Rodier bathed two slight wounds he had received

in the scuffle with water from the pots filled during the storm, and

assured Smith that they were nothing to trouble about.
Some few minutes after leaving the inhospitable village they noticed

the smoke of a steamer, a good deal nearer the shore than the dhows

which they had seen occasionally on the Gulf. It was too far distant

for them to determine its size and nationality, or to guess the

direction in which it was bound. Smith decided to speak it in passing,

but, observing that the stay had not been thoroughly fixed in the

hurry of their departure, he looked about for a suitable

landing-place, where the finishing touches might be given. The coast

was rocky and precipitous, and the tops of the cliffs were strewn for

a considerable distance inland with innumerable boulders, large and

small, which would render landing dangerous, and starting perhaps more

dangerous still. At length, however, just as he was thinking of

running inland, in spite of the loss of time, Rodier caught sight of a

large expanse of smooth rock, left bare by the falling tide. He

pointed it out to Smith, who made a hasty calculation of its extent,

and judged that it would serve his purpose. Steering to it, he circled

round it and dropped gently upon its western end, scaring off a

flamingo that was sunning itself there in solitary state.
"We came well out of that, Roddy," he said, as they set to work on the

stay.
"But we lose time by all these stops, mister," replied Rodier. "We can

perhaps make it up if you keep your gold in your pocket."
"I made a mistake there, certainly. If anything of the kind occurs

again our motto must be 'take it or leave it.'"
"Just as you say to a cabby."
"You are sure you are not hurt much?"
"No more than with a cat's scratches. You came in the stitch of time,

though."
"'A stitch in time saves nine,'" quoted Smith, smiling a little at the

Frenchman's mistake. "That's why we had better make a good job of

this. We don't want to stop again."
Ten minutes' work sufficed to fix the stay firmly in its place. Smith

again started the engine, the aeroplane taking the air when it was

only half-way across the rock. They looked around for the steamer when

they were again going at full speed, but it was no longer visible. In

a few minutes, however, the smoke again came into view, and as they

rapidly approached it Smith was delighted to see that it came from the

funnel of a small gunboat, which was steaming in the same direction as

their own flight, making probably for Bombay or Karachi. The chances

were that such a vessel in these waters was British, so Smith steered

towards it, shouting to Rodier that they might perhaps arrange a

tit-for-tat with the Baluchis.
There was much excitement on board the gunboat when the aeroplane

planed down and soared over it at its own pace, just high enough to be

out of reach of sparks from the funnel.
"Who are you?" shouted Smith through a megaphone.
"Gunboat Penguin, Captain Durward, bound for Bombay. Who are you?"

came the answer.
"Lieutenant Thesiger Smith, of the Imperturbable, bound for

Karachi."
"The deuce you are! What do you call that vessel of yours?"
"My pet lamb," replied Smith, grinning. "I say, sir, I've no time for

explanations. Are you policing these seas?"
"This is my beat. Why?"
"Some Baluchis are gun-running fifty miles up the coast, that's all.

Thought you'd like to know."
"Are they, begad! Thanks for the tip. Can you describe the spot?"
"A tiny village lying behind a point. A river runs through it, and

there's a short jetty. Sorry I can't give you latitude and longitude.

You'll catch 'em if you hurry up. Hope you will, and—run 'em in.

Good-bye."
He set the engine at full speed again, and as the aeroplane soared on

like a swallow its departure was followed by a lusty British cheer.
"Three hours late, mister," Rodier bawled in Smith's ear.

CHAPTER VII
THE WHITE DJINN
 
It was half-past six by Smith's watch, near eleven by local time, when

  the aeroplane sailed across the long mangrove swamp that forms the

  western side of the harbour of Karachi. The sun was intensely fierce,

  and Smith, who found its glare affecting his eyes painfully, had

  donned a pair of huge blue-glass goggles. He was glad that he had done

  so when, passing over the crowded shipping of the port, he saw the

  sandy arid tracts around and beyond the town. Steamers hooted as the

  aeroplane flew above them; half-naked coolies lading the vessels with

  wheat and cotton, the produce of Sindh and the Punjab, dropped their

  loads and stared upwards in stupefied amazement. Smith could not wait

  to enjoy his first view of an Indian city. His business was to land at

  the first convenient place and find Mr. John Jenkinson, whose godown

  was near the Custom House, and obtain from him the petrol bespoken by

  Mr. Barracombe.
Being in complete ignorance where the Custom House lay, though he

guessed it would be somewhere near the seafront, he was at first at a

loss in which direction to make. There was no suitable landing-place

in the crowded city itself, and to the immediate south of it there

appeared to be nothing but mangrove swamps. Ascending to a

considerable height, however, he saw, some distance to the east, near

a railway line, a stretch of open brownish ground on which little red

flags stood up at intervals. He instantly jumped to the conclusion

that this was the golf course, though at this time of day there were

no players to confirm his judgment. This was an advantage, because it

promised that he might land without being beset by curious spectators.

Accordingly he steered in that direction, hoping that having safely

landed his aeroplane he might find some means of reaching the merchant

whose name Mr. Barracombe had cabled to him.
It happened that, just as the aeroplane swooped down upon the golf

course, an open vehicle like a victoria was driving slowly along a

road that crossed it from the railway towards the city. The turbaned

driver pulled up his horse and stared open-mouthed at this

extraordinary apparition from the sky, and when the aeroplane

alighted, and from the car stepped a tall, dirty creature with a

monstrously ugly face, the native whipped up his horse and with

shrill cries sought to escape the clutches of what he felt in his

trembling soul must be a djinn of the most evil kind.
Smith shouted to him to stop, but in vain; whereupon he picked up his

heels and ran to overtake the carriage. The horse was a sorry

specimen, and Smith, being a very passable sprinter, soon came up with

it, jumped in, and called to the driver to take him to Mr. Jenkinson's

godown. The man yelled with fear, and in sheer panic flogged his horse

until it went at a gallop, the vehicle swaying in a manner that any

one but a sailor would have found unpleasant. Both horse and driver

seemed to be equally affected with terror, but since the carriage was

going towards the city Smith was perfectly well satisfied, and did not

turn a hair even when it narrowly escaped a collision with a

bullock-wagon.
On they went, past some buildings on the right which appeared to be

barracks, until they reached a street in which there were so many

people that Smith thought it time to pull up before mischief was done.

Leaning forward, he gripped the driver's dhoti and drew him slowly

backward. The man yelled again; the passers-by stood in wonderment;

but with his backward movement the driver tightened his grip on the

reins, and within a few yards the panting horse came to a standstill.
"Where is Mr. Jenkinson's godown?" said Smith, releasing the driver.

But the man's terror was too much for him. Throwing the reins on the

horse's back, he sprang from his seat and fled, a vision of bare brown

legs twinkling amid white cotton drapery.
By this time a crowd of chattering natives had gathered round, who,

not having seen the aeroplane, were more amazed at the driver's

evident terror than at the passenger. He was dirty, it is true, and

not clad like the sahibs whom they were accustomed to meet, but when

he had removed his goggles they saw that he was certainly a sahib.

Smith was about to ask some one to direct him to Mr. Jenkinson's when

a native policeman pushed his way through the crowd, and in a shrill,

high-pitched voice and wonderful English, announced that he had come

to take the number of the carriage; it was clearly a case of furious

driving to the danger of the public.
"Shut up!" said Smith impatiently. "Find me a driver to take me to

Jenkinson sahib."
"Certainly, your honor," said the man, becoming deferential at once.
One of the bystanders, seeing the chance of earning a few pice,

volunteered to drive.
"Jenkinson sahib? all right, sahib; down by Custom House. You bet!"
The carriage rolled off, followed by a crowd of runners, eager out of

pure inquisitiveness to see the matter through. They passed Government

House, turned into dusty Macleod Road, and in five or six minutes

reached the Custom House, where, turning to the left for a short

distance along the Napier Mole, the driver pulled up at a wooden

godown, and said—
"Here we are again, sahib. Jenkinson sahib, all right."
Smith ordered the man to wait for him, and went into the godown. Here

he met with a disappointment. In answer to his inquiry the native

clerk, looking at him curiously, said that Mr. Jenkinson was not

there, was not even in Karachi.
At this Smith looked blank.
"Your name, sir, is Lieutenant Smith?" said the clerk politely, but

with an air of doubt.
"It is."
"Then I tell you what, sir. Cable came yesterday for Mr. Jenkinson. I

wired it, instanter, as per instructions, to esteemed employer at

Mahableshwar, where he recuperates exhausted energies. Reply just

come. Here you are: 'Refer Lieutenant Smith Mr. Macdonald. Regret

absence.' Mr. Macdonald, sir, little way off. I have honour to escort

you: do proper thing."
He conducted Smith some distance down the Mole, the carriage

following. Luckily Mr. Macdonald had not returned to his bungalow for

tiffin, but was napping in a little room behind his office, darkened

by close trellises, which are found necessary for keeping out the

clouds of sand blown up from the shore.
"Eh, what?" said Mr. Macdonald, when his clerk awakened him. "A

visitor this time of day? Well, show him in."
He let a little light into the room, and stared when Smith was

introduced. Smith was dripping with perspiration, and not having been

able to wash since leaving London, he felt that his appearance must

give a fellow-countryman something of a shock.
"What do ye want, man?" asked Mr. Macdonald, somewhat testily.
"Mr. Jenkinson referred me to you, sir—"
"I have no vacancies, none whatever, and—"
"My name is Lieutenant Smith, of His Majesty's navy, and I have just

arrived from England."
"I beg your pardon, Mr. Smith; I took ye for—well, I don't know what.

Take a wee drappie? You came by the Peninsular, no doubt. I hear she

came in this morning."
"No. I came by aeroplane."
The Scotsman stared.
"What's that ye were saying?"
"By aeroplane. The fact is, Mr. Macdonald, I'm in a hurry. I've got to

get off within an hour or so; and I want some petrol for my engine.

Mr. Jenkinson was to have arranged it for me, but being absent he

refers me to you, and I shall be immensely obliged if you can manage

it for me, and excuse my not entering into particulars, for which I

really haven't time."
"Is that a fact? Petrol, is it? Come away with me; only, upon my word,

sir, I will take it very kind if you will give me a few particklers of

this astonishing business as we go."
He put on a sun helmet, and led the way from the room. Jumping into

the victoria, he ordered the temporary coachman to drive to Harris

Road, a quarter of a mile beyond the Custom House. In the two minutes

occupied by the drive, Smith told the Scotsman merely that he had come

from Constantinople and was proceeding immediately to Penang on

important business.
"It took ye a week, I suppose?"
"No, I left there rather less than twenty-four hours ago."
"Man, you astonish me; fair take my breath away. But here we are."
He alighted at a store kept by a Parsi. It was a matter of a few

moments to purchase the petrol and machine oil, Smith paying for it

with English gold. The tins were rolled out; Mr. Macdonald hailed a

closed cab, into which they were put, and then they set off to return

to the golf links, Mr. Macdonald accompanying Smith, curious to see

the machine which had performed such an astonishing journey.
"I've read in the papers about these aeroplanes, but never seen one

yet. Is it your opinion, now, that we'll have a war in the air one of

these days?"
"I shouldn't wonder. We shall have cruisers and battleships, air

torpedoes and destroyers, air mines and air submarines."
"Are you pulling my leg, now?" asked Mr. Macdonald, but he received no

reply, for Smith had noticed an European provision shop, and

remembering that his biscuits and chocolate were running low, he

called to the driver to stop, and made some purchases. He took the

opportunity to lay in a dozen bottles of soda-water, and added a few

packets of Rodier's favourite cigarettes, for smoking during the

halts, for he would never allow a match to be struck near the engine.
Mr. Macdonald plied him with questions during the remainder of the

drive, and Smith was ready enough with his answers except on his

personal concerns. When they arrived at the links they found the

aeroplane surrounded by a vast crowd. The majority were natives, but

there was a sprinkling of Englishmen in the inner circle, and some

soldiers from the barracks were doing police duty in keeping the

onlookers at a distance from the aeroplane. Two British officers and

some civilians were talking to Rodier, who was cleaning the engine

with the assistance of a young fellow with the cut of a ship's

engineer.
The arrival of the cabs caused a stir among the spectators. Smith

alighted, asked Mr. Macdonald to see that the petrol and provisions

were carried quickly to the aeroplane, and advanced to ask Rodier how

he had been getting on.
"Like a house on fire, mister," replied the man. "Mr. Jones here is

just off the Peninsular, and has helped a lot."
"I say," said one of the officers, "is your man stuffing us up? He

says you have come from London in twenty-four hours."
"Quite true, Hawley," said Smith, with a smile. "Remember I googlied

you for a duck at Lord's last year?"
The officer stared.
"By George, it's Charley Smith! I didn't know you; you're like a

sweep. Yes, by George! and I stumped you and got it back on you. How

are you? Rogers, this is a gentleman of the King's navee—Charley

Smith, Elphinstone Rogers."
"How d'e do? Rummy machine, what!" said Captain Rogers.
"Yes, by George!" said Hawley. "What's your little game?"
"I've got seven days' leave, and am off big game hunting. Can't wait

for liners in these times."
"You don't say so!"
"Tigers, eh?" said Rogers. "Wish I was you! But is it safe? Looks

uncommon flimsy, what!"
"I hope for the best, but I haven't got a minute to spare. Sorry I

can't have a go at your pads again, Hawley. Finished, Roddy?"
"All complete, mister."
"All the stuff onboard?"
"Yes."
"Well, Mr.—Jones, is it? Much obliged to you. Roddy, pay those

fellows who've carried the stuff, and the drivers."
He handed him some silver.
"Hoots, man," said Mr. Macdonald; "that'll never do. They'll swank for

a week if you give them all that. Leave it to me."
"All right. You know best. Many thanks for your help. Hawley, d'you

mind getting your men to clear the course? I don't want to break any

bones. And perhaps you'll send a cable home for me. Address Thesiger

Smith, Cosham. Say 'All well.'"
"I'll do it, with pleasure."
"Thanks. Good-bye. Sorry I've got to rush off."
He shook hands all round, and jumped on board.
Rodier had already taken his place at the engine. It took a minute or

two for the soldiers to force the crowd back, an interval which Smith

utilized to trace on the map, for Rodier's guidance, the course he had

decided to follow. Then, the clatter of the starting engine silencing

the clamour of the crowd, the aeroplane ran forward and soared into

the air. Its ascent was hailed with a babel of shouts and cheers.

Smith waved his hand to his friends below; then, seeing that Rodier

had the map before him, he spread himself in his seat for a

comfortable nap.

CHAPTER VIII
A SHIP ON FIRE
 
Rodier had his full share of the Gallic dash which had won first

  honours in airmanship for France, but it was combined with the

  coolness and circumspection bred of scientific training, so that Smith

  was able to take repose in serene confidence that, barring accidents,

  the aeroplane would fly as safely under Rodier's charge as under his

  own. Karachi was soon a mere speck amid the sand. In less than

  half-an-hour the aeroplane was crossing the swampy delta of the Indus.

  Soon afterwards it flew over the Run of Cutch into Gujarat, leaving

  the hills of Kathiawar on the right. Sweeping over the head of the

  Gulf of Cambay, it crossed the railway line from Bombay to Baroda, and

  then the broad river Nerbudda. The city gleaming white in the

  sunlight, far to the left, must be Baroda itself. The course traced by

  Smith in the few minutes before leaving Karachi, avoided the high

  western Ghauts that fringe the Indian coast to far south of Bombay.

  Rodier therefore steered somewhat to the east, coming in the course

  of twenty minutes to the river Tapti. Seeing a line of mountains

  straight ahead, he swung round still more to the east, following the

  valley of the river until he had completely turned the mountains, the

  northernmost spurs of the Ghauts.
Now he turned south-east once more, crossed the Chandaur chain, and

presently came in sight of the Godaveri river, which traverses the

whole breadth of Hyderabad. Near Indor he left the river on his left.

By this time it was becoming dark. Smith still slept, and Rodier, who

was not able to steer by the stars, was considering whether he had not

better waken his employer when he spied the characteristic glare from

a locomotive furnace far ahead. In half-a-minute he had caught up the

train, and slowed down to make sure of the direction in which the

railway ran. He found that it was almost exactly south-south-east, and

concluded from a glance at the map that he was above the connection of

the Hyderabad railway running from Warangal to the coast of the Bay of

Bengal. Reassured, he resolved to let Smith have his sleep out,

followed the line until it swept eastward at Secunderabad, and then,

steering a little to the left, put the engine once more to full speed.

In less than an hour afterwards he saw a vast expanse of water

glistening in the light of the rising moon, and knew that he had

reached the sea.
Being by this time thoroughly stiff and tired, and knowing, moreover,

that Smith would navigate the aeroplane over the sea with much more

certainty than himself, he shouted to awaken him. This proving

ineffectual, he leant over and nudged his shoulder. Smith was awake in

an instant.
"Where are we?" he cried; but no answer was necessary; he saw the sea

below him, and stretching far to the east, north, and south. He

exchanged places with Rodier, who, too tired even to eat, fell asleep

at once.
"Good thing he woke me," thought Smith. It was one thing to fly over

land, with guiding marks in the shape of rivers, mountains, and other

physical features that could be recognized more or less easily from

the map; and quite another to cross the pathless ocean. But with a

compass and a clear sky the course would present no difficulty to a

seaman, and Smith settled down to a flight that would be without

obstruction for at least seven hundred miles.
He knew that in the Bay of Bengal the prevailing wind at that season

is south-westerly. Whether there was any wind or not it was impossible

to ascertain while the aeroplane was maintaining its enormous speed;

certainly there was none to cause unsteadiness. If wind there was, it

blew in his, favour, and all that he would have to do would be to

allow in steering for a slight northerly drift. He would certainly

sight the Nicobar group, and possibly the Andaman Islands if he did

not make sufficient allowance for the wind; but he was determined not

to alight if he could help it until he arrived at Penang; he had lost

time enough already.
It was the first time he had flown across so wide an expanse of sea,

and he felt a touch of anxiety lest the engine should break down. If

any accident should happen he had made up his mind that the only thing

to be done was to don the lifebuoys, cut the engine loose, and trust

to the buoys to keep them and the planes afloat until their plight was

observed from some passing vessel. In the darkness this would, of

course, prove a vain hope; even in daylight the chance that a vessel

would be in sight was remote. But the die was cast: the engine was as

yet working perfectly; and in three or four hours, all being well, he

would come in sight of land.
There being no obstruction to fear, he kept at a height of only a

hundred feet above sea level. The sea was calm, gleaming like a sheet

of silver in the moonlight, so that the aeroplane seemed to fly over a

continuous glistening track. Steadily it flew on; Smith had nothing to

do but to sit still, feed the engine with petrol, and keep his eyes

alternately on the compass and the stars.
At length, about six o'clock by his watch—past eleven in the

longitude to which he had arrived—he caught sight ahead of a dark

outline on the water, no doubt a group of islands, though whether the

Andamans or the Nicobars he did not feel sure. Knowing that they were

all hilly in formation, he slackened speed, intending to run down

their coastline rather than cross them. It would not be difficult to

find one of the many channels between them through which he could

continue his flight, past the northern end of Sumatra to Penang. By

taking a southerly course, moreover, he would, be able to assure

himself of his direction.
After a short run parallel with the coastline he came to a wide

channel which he believed to be, and subsequently ascertained to be,

the Ten Degree channel between Little Andaman and Car Nicobar. From

this, if he was right, there would be an uninterrupted course

south-east to Penang. But within half-an-hour of entering the channel,

still flying low, he suddenly ran into a dense cloud of exceedingly

pungent smoke, which completely hid the sea beneath him. It made him

cough, and woke Rodier with a start.
"What's this, mister?" he shouted, rubbing his eyes.
"Forest on fire," shouted Smith in reply, though he was surprised to

meet with the smoke so far from land as he supposed himself to be. He

hastily planed upwards, in case, by some error of navigation, he had

come upon land and might endanger the aeroplane among hills or

tree-tops, and also to avoid the risk of explosion from a stray spark.

Still more surprised was he when, after only a few seconds, the

aeroplane passed completely through the smoke, and he saw the sea

again. At that instant, just as they reached the windward side of the

smoke-cloud, which was evidently blown by an easterly wind, Rodier

gave a cry.
"Mon Dieu! A ship on fire!"
Smith instantly checked the engine, and, swinging round in a narrow

circle, saw a dark shape below him from which smoke was pouring up.

There was no flame, but as the aeroplane dropped gently downwards

Smith saw that Rodier's explanation must be correct, the ship being a

sailing vessel.
A fire at sea is the sailor's worst terror. Urgent as was his own

errand, Smith could not pass without at least inquiry, so he sank

still lower, steering as close alongside the vessel on the windward

side as the planes would allow. He perceived now that she was

dismasted and had a bad list. Lifting his megaphone, he shouted—
"Ahoy there! Who are you?"
No answer reached him, though he saw that the crew were crowding on

deck, gazing up at him, and one man, no doubt the captain, was making

a trumpet of his hands.
"I can't hear owing to the noise of my engine," shouted Smith.

"Haven't you got a megaphone?"
He was acutely conscious at that moment of two disadvantages which the

airman had not yet been able to surmount. He had not yet invented a

noiseless engine, nor could he keep the aeroplane motionless in the

air. If Smith could have transformed his vessel for a few minutes into

a Zeppelin airship he would gladly have done it.
Now a megaphone had been brought to the captain, and his words came,

though faintly, to the ears of the airmen.
"Barque Elizabeth, from Calcutta to Dundee with jute. Dismasted in a

cyclone ten days ago west of the Andamans; been adrift ever since.

Fire broke out in cargo in the fore hold; had as much as we could do

to keep it under; no time to rig a jury mast. Afraid of flames

bursting through any minute."
He asked no questions and showed no surprise about the aeroplane. It

was evident that he could give no thought to anything but the

desperate plight of his vessel.
Smith was in great perplexity. He could do nothing for the ship;

perhaps his best course would be to make all speed for the nearest

port and send a steamer to her assistance. An idea struck him.
"Can't you get off in your boats?" he called.
"All carried away but one. She won't hold half of us. Besides, can't

desert the ship."
"Many passengers?"
"Only my daughter."
"His daughter, Roddy. I wish we could do something, but I don't know

what."
"Ah! go down and lift her off, mister."
Smith reflected. A girl would probably weigh little more than the

petrol they had consumed. The suggestion was feasible, and if the

captain's daughter had pluck enough to risk the journey, no doubt her

father would be glad to know that she at least was safe.
"We can but make 'em the offer," he said to Rodier; then shouted

through the megaphone: "We're coming down. Get your men to clear the

deck aft, and show lights and stand by to lend a hand."
All this time the aeroplane was moving slowly in circles over the

vessel, being still careful to keep on the windward side for fear of

sparks. When Smith's instructions had been carried out, he selected a

landing place just abaft the mizzen and, warping his planes

alternately, brought the aeroplane gently to the deck. Fortunately

the bulwarks were sufficiently low not to catch the planes or the

stays supporting them.
Smith and Rodier stepped on deck, and were instantly surrounded by a

group of the officers and crew.
"Get for'ard," shouted the captain to the men. "D'you want to see a

blaze?"
He was left with the first mate.
"I'm in a pretty fix, sir," he said, after a rapid glance at Smith.

"We drifted south and southeast after the storm, then lay becalmed for

a day or two; yesterday an east wind sprang up and carried us

northward."
"What are your bearings?" asked Smith. "I'm in the Navy."
"You don't say so, sir! Yesterday's observations gave us latitude nine

degrees forty-seven minutes south and longitude ninety-four degrees

thirty-two minutes east."
"Well, look here, the best thing I can do is to run for a port and

send you help."
"I'd take it very kind if you would, sir. I was thinking of sending my

daughter off in the boat to-morrow with a few men; but we've managed

to keep the fire under so far, and if there's a chance of getting help

within a day, say, perhaps we can keep all together. It's terribly

risky in these seas in an open boat."
"Well, I'll set a course for Penang—"
"Port Blair's nearer, sir, in South Andaman."
"But I'm more likely to find a fast steamer at Penang. And as to your

daughter, captain, she'd better come along with us."
"In that what-you-may-call-it, sir?"
"Yes, certainly. We can easily carry her, and make a comfortable seat

for her behind ours if you give us a cushion. We've come from London,

so she needn't be afraid."
"From London! Near seven thousand miles! Jigger me if ever I heard the

like of it! What do you think of that, Mr. McWhirter?"
"Rather a long un," replied the mate.
"Well, hang me, if you've come across the Bay of Bengal, you're sartin

sure to be able to make Penang. She shall go with you, and that'll be

one load off my mind. Go and fetch her, Mr. McWhirter. She's rather a

superior gal, sir, though I say it myself. She's had a rattling good

eddication; talks French like a native, and as for music and singing,

I've never heard any gal as could touch her, that's a fact. Here she

is."
Smith was not sorry that the outflow of paternal pride was checked. He

wanted to get on. A girl of about twenty came forward with the mate.

She was very self-possessed, and met Smith's look frankly.
"My daughter, Mr. ——. I don't know your name, sir," said the

captain.
"My name's Smith." He doffed his cap.
"Now, Margy, my girl, Mr. Smith, who's in the Navy, is going to be so

kind as to take you in his what-you-may-call-it to Penang, and send a

steamer to take us off or tow us in, as the case may be."
The girl looked startled, glancing from Smith to the aeroplane, and

then at her father.
"I think I'd rather stay with you, Father," she said quietly.
"And I'd rather you didn't," he said bluntly. "You don't know the risk

as I do, my gal," he added kindly. "The blessed ship may blaze at any

moment."
"I know, Father; but we've been in danger for several days, and I've

got used to it."
"Ay, that's true, and you've been an uncommon plucky girl, I will

say. She ain't like them females that faint and go into high strikes

and fidget your life out," he said to Smith, who observed the girl's

face flush. "Now, my dear, you'll go with Mr. Smith, and please your

old father. There ain't a morsel of danger; he's come safe all the way

from London, and I never see a better bit of manoeuvring, I will

say, than when he brought the what-you-may-call-it down on the deck as

light as a feather. It'll be a big sight safer than this poor old

hulk, and I'll be thankful to know as you're safe in Penang. You can

berth with my old friend Sam Upton and his missis, and please God

I'll come for you in a day or two."
"I assure you, Miss—Miss Margaret," said Smith, "that there's really

very little risk. We've come six thousand odd miles safely, and it's

not far to Penang, you know. You won't be the first lady to fly in an

aeroplane."
"Ma foi, non!" cried Rodier, unable to keep silence any longer. "I

myself, mademoiselle, have kept company in an aeroplane with a lady.

Ah, bah! vous parlez français; eh bien! cette femme-là a été ravie,

enchantée; elle m'a assuré que ce moment-là fut le plus heureux de sa

vie."
"Shut up, Roddy," whispered Smith, smiling, however, as he caught a

twinkle of amusement in the girl's eyes.
"I will go if you wish," she said to the captain, without replying to

Rodier.
"That's right. Mr. McWhirter, will you please get a couple of cushions

and put them in the thingummy where Mr. Smith shows you."
The seat was quickly prepared. Meanwhile Smith consulted with Rodier

on the somewhat delicate problem how to make a start from the deck,

which obviously did not afford more than a few feet of running-off

space. Rodier hit on a solution, and by the time the passenger's seat

was ready the necessary arrangements had been made.
"Now, my gal," said the captain, "step aboard. You sing like a bird;

it's only right you should fly like one." It was obvious that the

worthy seaman was making clumsy efforts to be cheerful. "I'll see you

in two days, or three at most; we've got a raft ready, you know, in

case the fire beats us. But, bless you, I shouldn't be surprised if we

have a fire-engine coming through the sky next; there's no knowing

what these clever young sparks won't be inventing. God bless you!"
The girl threw her arms round her father's neck. Smith turned away;

there were tears in the old man's eyes. The captain conducted her to

her place. Then he took Smith aside.
"You'll look after my gal, sir?" he said in an undertone. "She's all

I've got. Suppose you do come down; what then?"
"I shall jettison the engine and keep afloat by the planes. We've a

couple of life buoys, too. But I don't think we shall come down, so

make yourself easy, and we'll save your vessel."
"There's one man that never forgets a good turn, and that's John

Bunce. Where shall I find you in Penang, sir, if I get there safe?"
"Oh! I shan't be there. I'm going straight on to the Solomon Islands."
"Well, sir, if you're ever Rotherhithe way, you'll find me at 197

Prince's Road; I'm retiring after this voyage. Margy'll be proud to

give you a cup of tea, and I will say I'd like you to hear her

sing."
"All right, I won't forget. All ready, Roddy?"
"Ready and waiting, mister."
Smith went to his place.
"Are you quite comfortable, Miss Bunce?" he said, noticing that the

girl was pale and nervous. "I'm sorry I can't give you my seat, but my

man and I must sit together. You'll forgive us for turning our backs

on you."
The girl smiled faintly without speaking. Several of the crew had

ranged themselves on each side of the aeroplane, to hold it steady

until the propellers had worked up a good speed. Smith started the

engine; the deafening whirr began: then at the word "Go!" the sailors

released their holds and the aeroplane lurched forward just clear of

the bulwarks. Margaret Bunce clutched the rail nervously. One or two

of the men had been somewhat slow in letting go, causing the aeroplane

to cant over in a manner that was alarming to the onlookers. But long

practice with the aeroplane in all kinds of gusty weather had

developed in Smith an instinct for the right means of meeting an

emergency of this nature. Like a bicyclist, he did the right thing

without thinking. The vessel righted itself at a touch on the warping

lever, and in two or three seconds she was sailing rapidly away from

the ship.

CHAPTER IX
A PASSENGER FOR PENANG
 
From the information given him by Captain Bunce, Smith hoped to pick

  up the lights of Penang without much difficulty. While on the ship's

  deck he had noticed that the easterly breeze was very light, so that

  even with the slight additional weight he carried, his speed would not

  be greatly diminished. With good luck three or four hours would see

  him safe in port.
Rodier pulled out his watch soon after they started, and comparing it

with the schedule of the journey, shouted in Smith's ear—
"We are four hours late, mister."
"I know we are," cried Smith. "Confound you, Roddy, you're always

telling me I'm late. If you say anything like that again I'll throw

you out."
Rodier grinned.
"Mademoiselle wouldn't like that," he shouted. "Tout va bien,

mademoiselle?" he said, turning to the lady. "Vous n'avez pas peur?"
"It is terribly fast," said the girl breathlessly, and Rodier came to

the conclusion that Captain Bunce's opinion of his daughter's

linguistic ability was exaggerated.
The moon had set, and the flight was continued in almost total

darkness. At length, shortly before four o'clock in the morning, Smith

caught sight of lights ahead. He had touched at Penang some years

before, when his first ship was on her way out to the Australian

station, and he knew that the most suitable place for alighting was a

large open space, clear of vegetation and buildings, about a mile from

the port. In a few minutes the aeroplane was flying over the sleeping

town. He slackened speed, and circled around for some time, seeking

the spot with the aid of his searchlight. He discovered it with more

ease than he had dared to hope, and bidding Rodier look out for

obstacles, descended to the ground.
"Here we are, Miss Bunce," he said cheerfully, as he stepped out. "I

hope you feel none the worse for your ride."
"It is wonderful," said the girl. "I shall never forget it."
"The question is, what are we to do now? Your father mentioned a

friend of his, but as I have little time to spare I think you had

better come with me to my friend Mr. Daventry. He is in the

administration here, and I am sure Mrs. Daventry will be glad to do

anything she can for you. You see, I can find my way there in the

dark, I think, whereas we should have to wait until daylight to find

your father's friend, and that would be a nuisance in every way."
"I will do whatever you think best."
Leaving Rodier with the aeroplane, the other two set off towards the

town.
"You will try to send help to Father?" said the girl.
"As soon as it's light. This is Sunday morning, by the way. You're

all right, but I'm afraid I look far from Sundayish. Still, no one can

see me, and I shall be off before the people go to church."
"So soon as that? Aren't you very tired?"
"Not so tired as I've been in the manoeuvres. We get a nap in turn,

you know."
"How can you sleep when you're in such terrible danger?"
"Well, you see I'm used to it. We don't think of the danger. Perhaps

it's because I've never had a bad accident. The want of a decent meal

is the worst of it. We haven't had one since Thursday night, but I

daresay we can keep going on light fare for another three or four

days."
"You know I've often wanted to go up in an aeroplane, though I

suspect I should have backed out if I had really had the chance. I'm

very glad Father insisted on my coming, but I wish it had been

daylight; I could only hold on and try not to be afraid."
"I'm sorry we can't take you with us—no, I don't quite mean that,

Miss Bunce; of course you couldn't come careering about; what I mean

is that I shall be very glad to take you a daylight trip one of these

days if you care to come—when we get back home, of course. Captain

Bunce was kind enough to give me an invitation; he said you would give

me a cup of tea—"
"And sing to you! I know exactly what he said; but you mustn't pay too

much attention to Father. He's a dear old man, but quite absurd over

my little accomplishments."
"But I may have a cup of tea?"
"With or without sugar—if you really mean it."
"Of course I mean it. One of these days you will find my aeroplane at

your door—"
"Good gracious! it will be in pieces, then, for our street isn't wide

enough to give it room."
"Well, you'll find me at the door then; and after I have had my cup

of tea, with three lumps of sugar, and you have sung a little

song—just to please your father, of course—we will walk to where my

man is waiting with the aeroplane, two or three streets off, and we'll

take a jaunt to Greenwich Park, or Richmond, or wherever you like."
"That will be very nice," said Miss Bunce, and Smith wished it were

not too dark to see her face, for the tone expressed utter disbelief.

He wanted to assure her that he meant what he said, but, reflecting

that he had better not seem to suggest that she doubted it, he said—
"That's settled, then. I suppose it will be three or four months

before you get home, and I shan't have another leave for I don't know

how long, so we won't fix a date. Now Mr. Daventry's bungalow is in

this direction; I hope I shall be able to find it."
They walked about for some minutes before Smith was able to satisfy

himself that he had discovered the bungalow. They passed through the

compound, looked with a smile at the native servant sleeping on a mat

at the door, and laughed to see him jump when awakened by Smith's

vigorous rapping. At a word from Smith the man went into the dwelling,

but a moment afterwards a window above the entrance was thrown open,

and a loud voice demanded what was the matter.
"That you, Daventry?" Smith called.
"Yes. Who are you? What's the matter?"
"It's Charley Smith. Sorry to disturb you at this unearthly hour, old

chap."
"What in the name of—! All right. I'll come down."
They saw a light struck; in a minute they saw framed in the doorway a

tall man in pyjamas, holding a candle.
"Come in, Smith," he cried. "Why, what the—! Here, I say, I won't be

a minute."
Setting down the candle on the doorstep, he hurriedly fled. Smith

glanced at the girl. She was quite unembarrassed, and when she caught

his eye she frankly smiled. "She's the right sort," he said to

himself. Presently Mr. Daventry returned in trousers and a smoking

jacket.
"Excuse my leaving you. I went to—to waken Mary," he said. "She'll be

down in a minute; come in. Didn't know you were married, old boy," he

whispered, taking Smith by the arm.
"Hush!" said Smith anxiously, hoping that Margaret Bunce had not

caught the words.
Mr. Daventry led them into his dining-room, turned on the lights, and

looked inquiringly at his visitors. The girl was already unpinning her

low cloth hat.
"Why, what on earth—!" exclaimed Mr. Daventry; "what have you been

doing to yourself, Smith?"
"I am a bit of a sweep, no doubt, but you can give me a bath. The

fact is—well, it's plaguey difficult to tell it shortly—but the fact

is I picked up this lady—no, hang it all! Miss Bunce, please help me

out."
"Mr. Smith picked me up, as he says, from a burning ship in mid-ocean,

and was kind enough to bring me here in his aeroplane."
"Sounds simple, don't it?" said Smith, as Mr. Daventry looked from one

to the other in amazement.
"But—I don't understand—mid-ocean—an aeroplane? Mary," he added to

a lady in a dressing-gown who had just entered, "come and listen to

this. You know Charley Smith? Miss—Miss—"
"Margaret Bunce," said the girl, rising.
"My wife. Now, let us all sit down and see if we can make this out. If

I understand aright Miss Bunce was in a burning ship in mid-ocean—"
"Oh, poor thing!" said Mrs. Daventry sympathetically, going to

Margaret and taking her hand.
"And—correct me if I'm wrong—Smith descended out of the clouds,

caught up Miss Bunce, and flew with her to the house of his nearest

friend. Is your aeroplane outside, old man?"
"It's a mile away, in charge of my chauffeur. I think I had better

tell the whole story from the beginning."
"I think so, too; it's rather cloudy at present. Have a cigar—if the

ladies don't mind."
"Well, two days ago I learnt that my father was shipwrecked along

with the company of his survey vessel on one of the Solomons,

practically unarmed, the report says. As the news was taken to

Brisbane by some of the crew in an open boat, they must have been at

the mercy of the savages for a week or more, and probably hard pushed.

Of course a gunboat was to be sent to relieve them, but as every hour

was important I decided to try to get to them in my aeroplane and take

them some ammunition. Last night, coming somewhere south of the

Andamans, we saw a ship on fire; she was adrift, lost her masts and

all boats but one. The captain asked me to send help as soon as I got

here, and Miss Bunce was good enough to accept our escort, and here we

are."
"Good heavens!" exclaimed Mr. Daventry. "But—I don't understand yet.

How did you come to be by the Andamans? Where did you come from?"
"Left London early Friday morning: came by Constantinople and

Karachi."
"Upon my word, Smith, if I didn't know you I should be inclined to ask

if you are sober. You have come all the way from London since Friday

morning?"
"Exactly. But I know you'll excuse me: I haven't time to tell you any

more. We are already four hours late, and every hour means nearly two

hundred miles. There are two things I want to do. First to arrange

with the port officer to send help to Captain Bunce; then to get the

petrol and lubricating oil ordered for me here. Van Kloof's the man.

You know him, of course."
"Yes, but it's Sunday."
"The better the day, the better the deed. I must have the petrol; I

must start in two hours or less. And I should like a good bath and a

breakfast first."
"You shall have both, but surely you can wait till daylight."
"I'm afraid I can't. It is very awkward, I admit, and I fear I shall

give you and several others a lot of trouble; but needs must when the

devil drives, as they say, and the devil in this case is Father Time.

You see, I've not only got to take some rifles and ammunition to the

shipwrecked party, but I must rejoin my ship by Friday morning, or

there'll be ructions. I've got a name for overstepping the limit, and

my captain warned me that I'd better rejoin promptly this time."
"We mustn't hinder him, Jack," said Mrs. Daventry.
"But, hang it all, Mary, do you understand what it means? He'll kill

himself, rushing round the world like this."
"Not at all; I'm pretty tough," said Smith. "Now, old fellow, what is

the best you can do for me?"
"Go and get your things on, Jack," said Mrs. Daventry practically.

"You can take Mr. Smith down to the harbour and get what he wants.

I'll see about the bath and the breakfast, and I am sure Miss Bunce

will help; I won't disturb the servants. Really, it is quite

exciting."
"Thank you, Mrs. Daventry. It is very good of you. But I'm sure Miss

Bunce ought to go to sleep."
"I am not a bit sleepy," said the girl, "and I shall certainly help

Mrs. Daventry."
"Come along then, my dear," said the hostess. "We will go and see to

things at once."
In five minutes Mr. Daventry was down. He and Smith left the house and

made their way rapidly to the harbour. The port officer complained at

having his beauty sleep disturbed, and when he learnt that his

assistance was wanted for a burning ship near the Andamans he declared

that he wished wireless had never been invented.
"People know too much nowadays," he grumbled. "They'll know what we

think before we think it next."
"Don't undeceive him," whispered Smith to Daventry, anxious to escape

the necessity of lengthy explanations. The port officer agreed to send

a steamer in search of the Elizabeth as soon as it was light. Then,

without losing a minute, Daventry led Smith to the house of Mr. Van

Kloof, of whom the petrol had been ordered.
"He's a bit of a slow-coach," said Daventry, "and will want to know

all about it, so I advise you to tell him everything; or better still,

leave it to me."
"Very well. Anything to save time."
Mr. Van Kloof was hard to awaken. When he was at last aroused by his

servants, he put his head out of his bedroom window, and demanded

gruffly what was the matter.
"Come down, Van Kloof, and I'll explain. It's a matter of life or

death," said Daventry.
"Vat is it? An earthquake?"
"Worse than that. Slip into your breeches, man."
The merchant presently appeared at his door in shirt and breeches, and

carrying a revolver.
"You got a cable from London ordering eighty gallons of petrol to be

held ready for Lieutenant Smith?" said Daventry.
"So. Dat is quite true."
"Well, here is Lieutenant Smith, and he wants the petrol at once."
Mr. Daventry explained where the petrol was to be sent.
"No, it cannot be done, Mr. Daventry. It is Sunday morning. My store

is closed, and I do not understand the hurry."
"Lieutenant Smith is off to the Solomon Islands to save his father

from being eaten by cannibals. There isn't a moment to lose."
"Dat is strange. For vy should I take oil for a motor-boat up country?

You are playing games vid me?"
"Of course not. He's not going by motor-boat, but by aeroplane."
"Oho! Tell dat to the marines."
"Hang it, Van Kloof, listen without interrupting. Mr. Smith has come

by aeroplane from London, and is going on at once. Give me the key of

your store, and we'll go and get the stuff ourselves."
"Veil, of all the—pardon me, gentlemen, but you vill allow me to be

shocked to hear such news at five o'clock on a Sunday morning. I vill

come vid you. I must vake up some coolies to carry the cans. But it

shall be done; I vill myself see to it. I must look vell at dis

aeroplane."
"You're sure we can rely on you?"
"I vill bring all before an hour, you may trust me for dat."
"Then we'll hurry back, Smith, and see about your breakfast. What

about your man, by the way?"
"He's cleaning the engine by searchlight, and eating sardines and

biscuits, or something of the sort."
"Couldn't we fetch him?"
"I'm afraid there isn't time, and besides, he can hardly leave the

aeroplane unattended. It's hard lines, but I'll make it up to him when

we get back."
They returned to the bungalow. A steaming bath was ready. When Smith

had bathed, he found hot coffee and eggs awaiting him. He ate and

drank ravenously, and in a quarter of an hour declared that he must

get back to the aeroplane.
"Nonsense," said Daventry. "The petrol won't be there for half-an-hour

yet. You'll just lie down and rest, and have a comfortable smoke. I'll

go up the hill and take some food to your man."
"You're a good fellow," said Smith, dropping into a capacious

arm-chair. Mrs. Daventry arranged a cushion behind his head, Miss

Bunce placed a stool for him to stretch his legs on, and in

half-a-minute he was fast asleep.
"Don't wake him for an hour," said Mr. Daventry, as he left the house;

"I'll see that all is ready for him."
The sun was rising when Mrs. Daventry, now dressed for outdoors,

wakened the sleeper by lifting his hand. He sprang up with a start.
"Now, don't be agitated," said Mrs. Daventry. "It's just six o'clock.

Jack has gone to see that all is ready for you, and Miss Bunce and I

are coming to see you start. Really, I quite envy her, though I'm sure

I should never have the courage to go up in the air."
"You'll think nothing of it some day. You've been very kind, and I'm

immensely obliged to you. By the way, will you ask Daventry, in case I

forget it, to send a cable to my sister to say that I'm all right?"
"I won't forget. Now shall we go?"
They found that a small crowd had collected round the aeroplane. Mr.

Daventry and Mr. Van Kloof were there, with several other Englishmen,

and a number of Chinese coolies and nondescript natives stood at a

little distance, gazing in wondering silence. Rodier had his watch in

his hand, and looked reproachfully at his employer. Smith pressed

through the crowd, shaking hands with the Englishmen one after

another, but declaring that he had no time for talking. He shook hands

with the Daventrys and Miss Bunce last of all, thanking them very

heartily for their assistance; then, calling for a clear space, he

followed Rodier to his seat. Almost before the onlookers could realize

what was happening, the aeroplane was in action, and while they were

still discussing the extraordinary nature of this means of locomotion,

it had soared into the air, flown humming away from them, and become

a mere speck in the eastern sky.
They were scarcely clear of the ground before Rodier, raising his

voice to a bellow, shouted—
"Mister!"
"Yes. What?" replied Smith, fearing that something was wrong.
"Mister! We are four hours ten minutes late!"

INTERLUDE
 
"I'm afraid it's all up, doctor."
Day had just broken. Lieutenant Underhill, standing rifle in hand at

his post in a corner of the barricade, addressed Dr. Thesiger Smith,

who had come to relieve him.
"You think we can't hope for relief?" replied the doctor.
"Yes. The boat must have foundered, or got lost, or perhaps has fallen

into the hands of the savages. We've come to our last tin of biscuits;

we've hardly ten rounds of cartridges among us."
"What can we do then?"
"Either fight till we drop, or give in; there's nothing else. The end

will be the same either way, but the first would be the quicker."
The doctor stroked his beard with his thin hand. His son joined them;

not the ruddy, clean-shaven youth that had landed from the wreck

twelve days before, but a gaunt man whose hollow cheeks were dark with

a stubby beard.
"Underhill gives up hope at last," said his father.
"Then I'm ashamed of him," said Tom cheerfully. "Never say die. Go and

have a sleep, old man; it's enough to give any one the blues, keeping

watch in the dark. You'll feel better after a nap. Had any trouble?"
"No, they haven't made a sound. I almost wish they had. Anything would

be better than this eternal keeping watch for an enemy that's afraid

to come on."
"Well, not being a fighting man, I prefer for my part to keep a whole

skin as long as I can. Go and sleep, and the pater and I will talk

things over."
Underhill, who was tired out, withdrew to the centre of the camp, and

throwing himself on a tarpaulin, was soon plunged in an uneasy

slumber.
It was twelve days since the wreck, ten since the boat had put off to

seek assistance. When the storm had subsided, the castaways, drenched

to the skin, had taken stock of their situation. It was a wild and

desolate spot, far from the track of ships; months might pass before a

vessel came in sight. They had only a small store of food, barely

sufficient, even if husbanded with the utmost care, to last a

fortnight. From their position at the foot of rugged cliffs it was

impossible to tell what sustenance the island afforded, and the evil

reputation of the natives did not give promise of peaceful

exploration. While not actually head hunters, like the inhabitants of

the New Georgian group to the south, they were said to be treacherous

and vindictive. At the southern end of the island, as Underhill knew,

there was a Wesleyan mission station, placed in a somewhat

inaccessible spot, and at Tulagi, on Florida Island to the south, was

a Government station and the seat of the Resident. It might be

possible to reach one or the other of these, but even so they would be

compelled to wait indefinitely, there being no telegraphic

communication between either and a civilized port.
Reflections like these did not tend to cheer the castaways; but, now

that the sun shone once more out of a clear sky, the invincible

optimism of the British sailorman displayed itself, and the men began

to scramble up the cliffs with almost light-hearted eagerness. At the

top they found themselves at the edge of a dense and tangled forest.

Underhill sent some of the crew to search for a likely camping place,

while the remainder hauled up the boat's cargo. A comparatively clear

space, about a hundred and fifty yards square, was discovered within a

short distance from the cliffs. A stream running through the midst

ensured a good supply of water, and here Underhill determined to make

his camp.
Great havoc had been wrought in the forest by the storm. Many trees

had been snapped off or uprooted; the ground was strewn with broken

branches; and when the whole party were assembled at the spot, and the

arms and provisions had been covered with a tarpaulin, Underhill sent

all hands to collect broken timber for forming a breastwork.

Fortunately, a good number of tools had been brought from the vessel,

and as the men came in with their loads, Rumbold, the ship's

carpenter, set to work, with the assistance of two or three, to

surround the enclosure with a rough fence. Underhill ordered them to

avoid the use of hammers and axes, the noise of which, carrying far in

these solitudes, might attract the attention of the natives, who, for

all he knew, had a village in the neighbourhood. There was no lack of

tough creepers which were serviceable for binding the logs together,

and a great number of cactus-like plants were cut down to form a

defensive lining to the barricade.
In the course of three or four hours the whole encampment had been

roughly fenced. It would not, in its present condition, prove a very

formidable obstacle to a determined attack; but the day had become

very hot, and Underhill was anxious to avoid overworking the men. The

barricade could be strengthened next day.
Just before nightfall the company ate a spare supper of tinned meat

and biscuit, and then, in a little group apart from the rest,

Underhill, with his officers and the Smiths, held a council to decide

on a course of action. They determined, after brief discussion, that

next day four of the men should take the boat and try to make their

way to Tulagi. The loss of the second boat had rendered it impossible

for the whole party to embark; but no doubt the Resident at Tulagi

would have boats of some sort at his disposal, and in these the

castaways could be taken off. When once at Tulagi, they would have to

wait until the first vessel touched at the island. Four men, including

Venables, volunteered to make the voyage, and were ready to start that

night; but every one was exhausted by the adventures and fatigues of

the day, and Underhill thought it best that they should have a night's

rest before they set off. Having arranged for watches to be kept as on

board ship, he gave the order to turn in, and their clothes and the

ground having been well dried by the afternoon sun, they passed a

comfortable and undisturbed night.
Up at daybreak, they first of all occupied themselves with completing

the barricade; then, about eleven o'clock, when they were preparing to

escort the four men to the boat, which had been anchored at the foot

of the cliff, some one cried out that he saw brown men advancing

through the woods. Underhill instantly ordered the barricade to be

manned, and served out arms and ammunition as far as they would go

round. There were only a dozen rifles, however, among twenty men; the

rest armed themselves with tools and implements of various kinds.

THEY SUDDENLY DARTED FORWARD WITH A WILD WHOOP
They suddenly darted forward with a wild whoop.

Soon a large body of brown-skinned, fuzzy-headed natives, armed with

spears, clubs, and bows and arrows, came slowly towards the camp.

Their attitude was apparently friendly, but, remembering their

reputation for treachery, Underhill did not trust them, and refused to

leave the shelter of the barricade in answer to their invitation,

expressed by signs, to come forth and palaver with them. It was well

he refrained, for when they were within a few yards of the camp they

suddenly darted forward with a wild whoop. Underhill ordered his men

to fire a volley over their heads, hoping to scare them away without

bloodshed; but the reports of the rifles did not make the astounding

impression it usually produced upon savages, and Underhill could not

but believe that they were not wholly unacquainted with the use of

firearms. They advanced with the more ferocity, and it was not until

several had fallen to another volley from behind the barricade that

they drew back to the shelter of the woods.
It would clearly be unsafe to attempt to reach the boat while the

savages were in view. As time went on they appeared to increase in

numbers, and every now and then they sent a flight of arrows into the

camp. But the garrison kept out of sight behind the barricade nearest

to the enemy, and their missiles either stuck in it, or fell

harmlessly within the enclosure.
So the day passed. The fact that trouble had come so soon impressed

Underhill with the necessity of sending for assistance without delay.

The prospect of a siege, with only a limited supply of ammunition to

repel assaults, and a scarcely greater supply of food, was very

disturbing. He had little fear of being able to beat off attack so

long as ammunition lasted, but when it was all spent, the savages must

overpower the white men by sheer weight of numbers. Venables now

wished to recall his undertaking, and remain in the fighting line; but

Underhill decided that he must go in command of the other men.

Accordingly, at nightfall, the four crept through a small gap made in

the seaward face of the barricade, and clambered down the cliff.

Underhill listened anxiously for a time, wondering whether the men had

been discovered, or whether they had safely reached the boat; but

after an hour of silence he concluded that either the enemy had not

been watching in that quarter, or that the boat had slipped away

unobserved in the darkness.
The night was undisturbed, but with dawn the natives reappeared. The

lesson of the previous day had not proved effectual; they came

resolutely up to the barricade in a vast yelling horde. Underhill

ordered his men to reserve their fire until the enemy was within a few

yards of the enclosure; then two rapid volleys with repeating rifles

and revolvers opened a great gap in the throng, and the survivors,

scared by their losses, once more betook themselves to the woods.

Several times during the day they returned to the attack, pushing it

home each time with more determination, and towards evening with a

rage and frenzy that could only be due to the stimulation of strong

liquor. At this last onset the defenders were almost overwhelmed,

repeated volleys seeming only to inflame the fierce warriors. For some

minutes there was a hand-to-hand fight as they made desperate

endeavours to scale the barricade, and only when a score of their

number lay dead and wounded did they relinquish the contest. They took

away the wounded, but left the dead where they lay, and in the night

the garrison had the gruesome task of carrying the bodies to the edge

of the cliff and casting them into the sea. For some time Dr. Smith

was kept busy in attending to the wounded among his own party, and

next day one of the stokers, struck by a poisoned arrow, succumbed to

blood-poisoning, and his comrades, at dead of night, gave him sailor's

burial.
Some days passed, and no serious attack was made, though the garrison

had to be very wary to avoid the arrows which flew at intervals into

the enclosure. One evening, soon after sunset, one of the men on watch

noticed a small light approaching the barricade, and thought at first

it was one of the phosphorescent insects which abounded in the woods,

and which the garrison had seen every night like little lamps among

the trees. But as it came nearer he perceived that it grew larger and

brighter, and moved from side to side with more regularity than was

probable with an insect, and at length he saw that it was a

smouldering torch held by a native, who was waving it to and fro to

cause a flame. Evidently he was coming to fire the barricade. A

well-directed shot brought him down, but to guard against any more

attempts of the same kind Underhill had the barricade constantly

drenched with water from the stream, a fatiguing job, but one that was

welcome to the men, in that it gave them something to do.
Day after day went by. It was clear that the enemy were trusting to

famine to accomplish their end. Luckily, it never entered their heads

to hasten the inevitable by damming up the stream before it entered

the enclosure. If they had done this the garrison could hardly have

held out for a day. In that hot climate a constant supply of water was

a prime necessity. But water without solid food would not keep them

alive, and as the stock of provisions diminished, and no help came,

they saw the horrors of starvation looming ever nearer. Underhill and

Tom Smith assumed a false cheerfulness before each other and the men,

but on the morning of the twelfth day Underhill was unable to keep up

the pretence any longer.
"I didn't want to show Underhill," said Tom to his father, when the

lieutenant had gone; "but we're just about done, I think."
"I'm afraid so, Tom. Poor Jenkins had a touch of delirium in the

night, and we are all getting so weak that we shall go off our heads."
"Well, I've got an idea. I thought I'd mention it to you before I

spoke to Underhill. The blacks haven't been near us for a day or two,

but you may be sure they are not far off. I fancy they've got a camp

or a village in the woods yonder. They must have food there, and I

don't see why we shouldn't try a night attack on them, and run away

with all we can lay hands upon. If we must, perish, better perish

fighting than starving."
"Yes, but it would be folly to attempt it unless we saw a chance of

success, and I see none. We don't know where their camp is; they may

be constantly on the watch, and could take us in the rear and occupy

our camp before we could get back. Besides, we might have to go a long

way, and how could we find our way back again?"
"One difficulty at a time, Father. As to finding our way back, we

could light small fires at intervals, which would serve as

guide-posts."
"And betray us to the enemy."
"But I shouldn't undertake it unless we discover that the course is

clear. I don't believe these natives ever keep watch by night; we have

seen no sign of them at night since they tried to burn us. The chief

difficulty is that we don't know the exact direction of their camp,

but why shouldn't I go out to-night and locate it?"
"Very dangerous, my boy."
"There's danger anyway," replied Tom, with a shrug. "I should take my

pocket compass; two or three of those insects would be enough to light

it."
"I think we had better remain all together, Tom. Help may yet come.

Why should you imperil your life, perhaps in vain?"
"Well, Father, I think I ought to chance it. I'll be careful! if I'm

seen I can make a bolt for it; and I fancy I can pick up my heels

quicker than the fuzzy-wuzzies, even though they don't wear boots."
Dr. Smith was still loth to acquiesce in the proposal, but Tom

returned to it more than once during the day, and at last obtained his

father's consent. It was scarcely easier to win over Underhill; but

with him Tom cut the matter short.
"You command the men," he said, with a smile. "My father commands

me—in a sense, for I'd have you know I am over age. I'm going to have

a try. Get the men ready to make a dash when I come back, for if I

succeed the sooner we set about it the better."
The knowledge of his intended expedition had a wonderful effect on the

spirits of the men. Their faces brightened: they threw off the

lethargy of despondence which had settled upon them, and discussed

with some animation the chances of success.
An hour after nightfall, having first looked and listened for any sign

of the enemy, Tom was let out through a gap in the barricade. He

caught two or three light-giving insects in the bushes just beyond,

and set off in the direction in which the natives had always retreated

when their attacks were beaten off.
It was pitch dark in the belt of forest. Night insects hummed around;

sometimes Tom heard the rustle made by some small animal as it darted

through the undergrowth; there was no other sound. He was able to

determine his general direction by means of the compass, but as the

forest grew thicker he began to fear that he would find more

difficulty than he had anticipated in retracing his course. The damp

warm air was oppressive; now and then he struck his head against a

low branch, stumbled over a stump or a fallen bough, or found his feet

entangled in the meshes of some creeping plant. He was soon bathed in

perspiration; every new sound made him jump; and with every stumble he

waited and listened with beating heart, wondering if he had betrayed

his presence to the enemy. He thought ruefully that his speed as a

sprinter would avail him little on ground like this; he had his

revolver, but that would be useless against numbers; discovery would

mean death.
Amid so many obstructions his progress was terribly slow. It was seven

o'clock when he started; when it occurred to him to look at his watch

he was startled to find that two hours had passed. He could not tell

how far he had come, nor guess how far he had yet to go. He hesitated;

should he go back? Was there any use in struggling further? What

chance was there in this dense forest of finding what he sought? Might

he not even miss the savages' camp altogether, go beyond it, leave it

either on his right hand or his left, or perhaps stumble upon it

suddenly, and be discovered before he had a chance to flee? But he put

these questions from his mind. He had set out to find the camp; no

harm had befallen him. There was a strain of doggedness in his nature;

he had won his scholarships at school and at Cambridge by sheer grit;

his tutor had declared that Tom Smith was certainly not brilliant,

but he was much better: he was sound and steady; and the same

qualities that had won him successes which more brilliant men envied,

came out in these novel circumstances in which he was placed. Tom

decided to go on.
Presently he came to a break in the woodland; he saw the stars

overhead. He was very wary now, and waited at the edge of the clearing

for a long time, peering all round, turning to listen on every side,

before he crossed and entered another belt of forest beyond. Again he

had to struggle through darkness and dense entanglements, then

suddenly he started; far ahead he thought he discerned amid the

blackness the dull glow of a fire. With infinite caution he picked his

way through the thinning undergrowth; the glow increased; and at

length he found himself on the edge of a wide open space in the midst

of which there was a camp fire, and around it the rude grass huts of

the savages. He saw no one, heard no sound; all were asleep.
Stealthily he crept round the encampment. Here and there he saw

cooking-pots, and caught the faint odour of roasted flesh. Had the

savages any store of food, he wondered. If not, his journey was vain.

The fire did not give light enough for him to see anything very

clearly. At last, however, when he had almost made the circuit of the

camp, he saw a man move out from one of the huts towards the fire, on

which he cast some logs that lay beside it. A flame shot up. As the

man returned to his hut, he put his hand into one of the cooking-pots

and drew out the limb of a small animal, from which he tore the flesh

with his teeth. Tom was satisfied. No doubt each of the pots contained

a quantity of food. Surely if he brought his comrades to the spot, and

they fell upon the camp suddenly, with loud cries and the noise of

firearms, they might strike panic into the savages, and at least have

time to possess themselves of the contents of the pots.
He looked at his watch. It was past ten o'clock.
He could return more quickly than he came, and, if he did not lose his

way, would regain his camp within half-an-hour after midnight. There

would be plenty of time for the whole party to reach the savages'

encampment before the dawn rendered it dangerous. Moving away slowly

until he was out of earshot, he then walked as quickly as he could

back through the forest. But he was not a mariner, and even a mariner

would have been at fault in tracking his course by compass through

dense forest. He judged his general direction accurately, but he

swerved a little too far to the right, and suddenly found himself on

the brink of the cliff. He dared not go back into the forest, lest he

should lose more time in wandering, so he decided to keep as close to

the sea as possible, thinking that he must in time arrive at his camp.

His path was tortuous; once he had to strike inland to avoid a deep,

wooded ravine; but presently he heard the sound of falling water, and,

quickening his steps, came almost suddenly upon the barricade.
The whole company were awake. They had almost given him up for lost.

It was one o'clock. Underhill sternly checked a cheer from the

sailors, when Tom ran up. He told what he had seen.
"Hadn't we better wait till to-morrow night?" suggested Dr. Smith.
"To-night! to-night!" cried the men eagerly. The knowledge that food

was within reach of them was too much for famishing men. Who knew if

they would have strength or sanity for the task after another

sweltering day? Underhill could not refuse them; he gave orders for

the whole company to march at once.
None was left to guard the camp; the little company of sixteen could

not be divided. They set off in single file, Tom leading the way, not

because he had any hope of treading in his former course, but because

he alone had traversed the forest, and he alone had a compass.
The plan of lighting fires to guide them on the return journey was

given up. The forest was so dense that such fires would have been of

little use; further, they might cause an immense conflagration which,

though it would effectually scare the enemy, would destroy what the

famished men so urgently needed, food.
Their progress was even slower than Tom's had been. They had to stop

frequently to make sure that all were together, and, as ill luck would

have it, Tom found that he was leading them through a part of the

forest where the entanglements were more intricate and less penetrable

than those he had formerly encountered. But he plodded on doggedly,

speaking to no one of his anxiety when a glance at his watch told how

time was fleeting. If they did not reach the camp of the savages

before dawn their toil and fatigue would be wasted, and their peril

greater than it had ever been.
Here and there, where the trees grew less close together, he felt a

slight breeze blowing in his face, and at length he detected a faint

smell of wood smoke. He halted, and told the rest, in a whisper, that

they were approaching a settlement. From this point they advanced

still more slowly and cautiously. Then, with a suddenness that took

them aback, they came to the edge of a clearing. At first Tom was not

sure whether it was the same that he had seen before. He had indeed

approached it from a different direction. But a glance around

satisfied him on this point, and the party stood within the shelter of

the trees while Underhill gave his orders. They were to fire one

shot, then rush forward with loud shouts, seize what food they could

lay hands on, and flee back in all haste. There was no time to be

lost, for the sky already gave hint of dawn.
Underhill had scarcely finished speaking when there was a cry from a

point near at hand. They had approached the camp from the wind-yard

side; the breeze had carried either some murmur of Underhill's voice,

low as he had spoken, or some faint scent which the natives, as keen

in their perceptions as wild animals, had detected. Instantly the camp

was in commotion: the dusky warriors poured forth from their little

huts, and swept, a wild, yelling horde, upon the weary company.

CHAPTER X
SOME PRAUS AND A JUNK
 
Smith's destination, on leaving Penang, was Port Darwin in the

  Northern Territory of Australia. He had never been at that port, and

  knew that a few years before it had been little more than a collection

  of grass humpys, inhabited by Chinese and Malays, with an iron shed

  for a Custom House, and a vast expanse of forest and jungle behind.

  But it was the principal port in the northern part of Australia, and

  he had no doubt that at Palmerston, the thriving town on the eastern

  shore, he would be able to obtain the necessary supply of petrol and

  oil.
His map informed him that his course lay across the Malay Peninsula,

Dutch Borneo, and the islands of Celebes and Timor. It was necessary

to rise to a considerable height to cross the hills that run like a

spine on the Malay Peninsula, and having passed those, he came in

little over an hour to the eastern coast, about a hundred and fifty

miles north of Singapore. In another hour and a half he reached the

coast of Borneo, whence for nearly three hours he saw beneath him an

almost unbroken sea of foliage, only one range of hills breaking the

monotony. Somewhat after midday he came to the straits of Macassar, at

the south-east extremity of Borneo. As he crossed these, he had an

unpleasant shock. The engine missed sparking once or twice when he was

half-way across the Straits, and he shouted to Rodier to loose the

life buoys in case it failed. There were several small craft beneath

him, so that he had no doubt of being picked up if the aeroplane fell,

unless, indeed, sharks "got in first," as he put it. But the

interruption of the sparking was only temporary, and he reached the

island of Celebes safely. Then he thought it merely prudent to descend

and overhaul the engine, though he deplored the loss of time. He

landed on a solitary spot where there was no likelihood of being

molested, and Rodier having cleaned the fouled plug that had caused

the trouble, they went on again.
They were sailing low over the deep bay formed by the two huge

tentacles that run south and south-east from the crab-like body of the

island, when suddenly, above the noise of the engine, they heard the

sharp crack of a shot, then two or three more. Glancing up the bay to

his left, Smith saw a large junk, its sails hanging limp, surrounded

by a number of small craft which from their appearance he guessed to

be praus. He had read many a time of the fierce Malayan pirates that

used to infest these seas, and was somewhat surprised to find that

piracy had apparently not been wholly suppressed. As a matter of fact,

European vessels no longer ran the same risks as of old, the Malays

having learnt by experience that sooner or later retribution was bound

to overtake them; but it was a different matter with Chinese junks. So

long as these could be attacked successfully and secretly, with no

witnesses to carry information to the outside world, there was little

risk in swooping down upon them. The celestial government did not

follow up piratical forays of this kind in seas distant from the

Empire itself; and the Malays were not likely to attack unless they

had a great advantage over their victim in point of numbers. A junk

might be seized and its crew massacred without the slightest whisper

of the event coming to civilized ears.
Smith saw the praus clustering round the junk like a swarm of bees. It

was impossible to doubt what the result would be. He was loth to lose

more time: the plight of a Chinese vessel was no concern of his; yet

as he glanced up and down the bay and saw that it could obtain help

from no other quarter, he could not bring himself to leave the

hapless Chinamen to the fate that must overtake them unless he

intervened. Slackening speed, he cried to Rodier—
"We must do something."
The Frenchman nodded. Smith swung the aeroplane round, and descended

until it was circling immediately over the junk and its assailants.

Cries of amazement broke from some of the Malays as they caught sight

of this strange portent from the sky, but the greater number were

climbing up the sides of the junk, heedless of all else than the work

in hand. There was something fascinating to Smith in the spectacle:

the almost naked Malays, armed with their terrible krises, swarming on

every part of the vessel; the Chinamen with pikes, muskets, and

stink-balls fighting with the courage of despair to keep the boarders

at bay. As yet the Malays had not gained a permanent footing on the

deck, but for every man that was felled or hurled back into the praus

there were a dozen to fill the gap, and the most valorous of fighters

could not long contend against such odds.
For a little while Smith was perplexed as to what he could do to help

them. The necessity of keeping the aeroplane in motion did not permit

either Rodier or himself to use his revolver effectively. Without

doubt the Malays would be scared off if they fully realized his

presence, for they could scarcely have seen an aeroplane before, and

it must be to them a very terrifying object. But a Malay, when drunken

with hemp and his own ferocity, is as little subject to impressions of

his surroundings as an infuriated bull. The men left in the praus were

gazing up in terror at the humming aeroplane; but even during the few

seconds of Smith's hesitation the others gained the deck of the junk

forward of the mast, and with fierce yells and sweeping strokes of

their krises began to drive the Chinamen towards the poop. In a few

minutes the whole crew would be butchered and thrown to the sharks.
Suddenly an idea occurred to Smith. He planed upwards till the

aeroplane reached a height of about a hundred feet above the vessel,

calling to Rodier to bombard the boarders with the full bottles of

soda-water which they had with them. The Frenchman chuckled as he

seized the notion. Smith kept the aeroplane wheeling in a narrow

circle over the scene of combat, and when it was vertically above the

deck Rodier flung down several bottles one after another among the

Malays. The effect was instantaneous. These novel missiles flung from

so great a height, acted like miniature bombshells, exploding with a

loud report as they touched the deck, and flying into myriad

fragments. Not even the most rage-intoxicated Malay could withstand

the shock. The noise, the prickly splinters of glass, peppering

their half-naked bodies like a charge of small shot, altered their

blind fury to dismay and panic. With screams of affright they rushed

to the sides of the junk. But the men left in the praus had already

begun to paddle frantically away, heedless of the fate of their

comrades. These plunged overboard, and swam after the departing

vessels, whose flight Rodier speeded with another bottle or two. In

less than a minute the junk was clear.

THE PRAUS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO PADDLE FRANTICALLY AWAY.
The Praus had already begun to paddle frantically away.

For some minutes Smith shepherded the praus toward the shore. Every

now and then he saw a swimmer disappear suddenly: without doubt the

sharks were gathering to claim their prey. Then, feeling sure that the

Malays were too much terrified to think of renewing their attack on

the junk, he again set his face eastward towards the open sea.

CHAPTER XI
AUSTRALIAN HOSPITALITY
 
Darkness was falling when the airmen came in sight of the chain of

  small islands running from Java eastward almost to the Australian

  coast. Knowing that these islands were very hilly, Smith rose to a

  great height, using his flashlight every now and then to guard against

  mishap. If he had not known the nature of the islands he could almost

  have guessed it from the behaviour of the aeroplane, which now tended

  to shoot upwards, now to sink downwards, irrespective of any volition

  of his own. This proved to Smith that he had come into a region of

  variable currents of wind, such as might be set up by the hollows and

  ridges of mountain tops. The forcing of the machine upwards implied

  that the pressure of the air ahead was increased, owing to a lull in

  the wind behind; the sinking implied that the force of a contrary wind

  was diminished, and that the inertia of the machine prevented it from

  readily accommodating itself to the new conditions. During this part

  of the voyage Smith had to be constantly alert to warp the planes

  instantaneously when he detected the least sign of instability, and he

  was very glad when he saw once more the reflection of the stars in the

  sea beneath him, and knew that he would encounter no more obstacles

  between Timor, which he had just passed, and Port Darwin.
His concern now was to pick up the light which, according to the

Admiralty's sailing directions, shone from an iron structure a hundred

and twenty feet high, about a mile south of Point Charles, the western

extremity of Port Darwin. Approaching the port from the west, as he

was, he should have no difficulty in seeing the light at a distance of

eighteen or twenty miles, the sky being clear. But as time went on

neither he nor Rodier caught sight of the red speck for which they

were looking. Half-past eight came, local time, as nearly as Smith

could calculate it by his watch, which still registered London time;

and even allowing for the hours lost he should by now have touched

land. He was beginning to feel anxious when he suddenly found land

below him—a land of dense forests, apparently low and flat. The

question was, whether this was the mainland of Australia or an island,

possibly Bathurst Island, north of Port Darwin. It was impossible to

tell. There was no time to ponder or weigh possibilities; yet if he

took the wrong course he might be hours in discovering his mistake,

and this part of Australia being almost wholly uninhabited he might

fail to find any guidance even if he descended. By a rapid guess—it

could not be called reasoning—he concluded that he had probably

steered a too southerly course, and that he would do right if he now

steered to the north-east. His indecision had lasted only a few

seconds; he brought the aeroplane round until she flew over the line

of breakers washing the shore, and followed the coast at full speed.
Within a quarter of an hour both the men caught sight at the same

moment of the red glow of the light, which grew in brilliance as they

approached it, and then diminished as the lamp revolved. Steering now

to the east, in ten minutes they were sailing over the town of

Palmerston, the capital of the Northern Territory. The lighted

streets, crossing at right angles, formed a pattern below them like

the diagram for the game of noughts and crosses. They found a landing

place a little to the north-east of the town, beyond the railway, and

having safely come to earth, Smith left Rodier to attend to the engine

and hastened towards the nearest house, a sort of bungalow of wood and

iron. Sounds of singing came from within.
A Chinaman opened the door to his knock. Smith asked if the master was

at home.
"Massa inside allo lightee," answered the man. "Me go fetchee,

chop-chop."
He soon returned, followed by a stalwart bearded Australian of about

fifty years, smoking a big pipe.
"Well, mate," he said, eyeing Smith curiously by the light of the door

lamp; "what can I do for you?"
"I must apologize for troubling you on Sunday night," began Smith.
"No trouble, I assure you. Come in." He led Smith into a little room

near the door. "We've a few friends in the parlour," he added, "and I

guess you can tell me here what you want."
"Well, to put it shortly, I should be very much obliged to you if

you'd direct me to Mr. Mackinnon. He's got some petrol waiting for me,

at least I hope he has, and I'm in great need of it."
"Well, that's real unlucky now. He went to Pine Creek down the line

only yesterday, and won't be back till to-morrow. Are you Lieutenant

Smith, may I ask?"
"Yes, that's my name."
"Mackinnon got a cable from Java on Friday about the petrol. He told

me about it, and mighty astonished he was. Motor-cars are pretty

scarce about here, and he hasn't got a great quantity of petrol. I

suppose it's for a motor-boat you want it? When did you leave

Java?—before the cable, I guess."
"I haven't come from Java at all. The cable was sent through there

from London. The fact is, I've come in an aeroplane."
"What! Over the sea?"
"Yes, over sea and land. I left Penang early this morning, and must go

on at once."
"Well, if I ain't just about flummuxed! D'you mean to say you've come

pretty near two thousand five hundred miles to-day?"
"Yes; I'll tell you in a word all about it."
His host, whose name was Martin, listened in mute amazement as Smith

briefly related the occasion of his long journey.
"Why, man," exclaimed Mr. Martin, when he had concluded his story;

"wonders'll never cease. You must be dead beat. I never heard the like

of it. Come into the other room. The boys'll be mad to hear this."
"Really, I'd rather not. I haven't any time to lose, and Mr. Mackinnon

being away—"
"Oh, that don't matter. He didn't expect you so soon, but we'll get

what you want, though it is Sunday. But a bite and a sup will do you

all the good in the world, and won't take you long, and the boys will

just go crazy if they don't see you. Why, it's round the world you're

going. My sakes! Come along."
He almost dragged Smith into a large, low room, where several men and

women, boys and girls, were seated round the wall. They were singing

hymns to the accompaniment of a harmonium. A table loaded with

eatables was pushed into a corner. The entrance of Mr. Martin,

followed by a dirty, unkempt, and oddly dressed stranger, caused an

abrupt cessation of the singing. The girl at the harmonium sprang up

with a startled look.
"What is it, Father?" she asked anxiously.
"Nothing to be scart about, my girl. Neighbours, this gentleman has

come all the way from London in an aeroplane."
The announcement was received in dead silence. Smith stood like a

statue as he listened to Mr. Martin's hurried explanation, resigning

himself to be the target of all eyes. Everybody crowded about him,

silent no longer, but all asking questions at once. Mrs. Martin went

to the table and brought from it a dish of chicken patties, which she

pressed upon him.
"Do'ee eat now," she said, in the broad accent of Devonshire. "I made

'em myself, and you must be downright famished."
"Not quite so bad as that," said Smith, with a smile, "I had a good

breakfast at Penang, and have nibbled some biscuits and things on the

way."
"Biscuits are poor food for a hungry man. Eat away now, do."
Other members of the family brought ale, cider, fruit, cakes, enough

for a dozen men, and for some minutes Smith's attention was divided

between eating and drinking and answering the questions which poured

upon him in a never-ending flood. Conscious of the lapse of time, he

at last said that he must go and obtain the fuel for his engine. The

men rose in a body, prepared to accompany him.
"I don't think we had better all go, neighbours," said Mr. Martin.

"I'll take Mr. Smith to the Resident; we shall have to see him about

the petrol, you know."
"There's one thing your friends can do for me," said Smith. "I want

ten or a dozen rifles, and a lot of ammunition. Can you provide them

at such short notice?"
"I should just think we can," said Mr. Martin. "Neighbours, get

together what Mr. Smith wants, and take 'em out along to the

aeroplane. It's just a step or two beyond the railway, from what he

says. Mother, send out some eatables, too, something better than

biscuits, to Mr. Smith's man, who's looking after it. Now, Mr. Smith,

come along. The Residency isn't far off: we're only a small town."
The two set off, and in a few minutes arrived at the Residency, a

stone building of more pretensions than the wood and iron erections of

which the town mostly consisted. The Resident was at home. Once more

Smith had to tell his story, once more to listen to exclamations and

reply to questions, grudging every moment that kept him. The Resident

had heard of the wreck of the Albatross, in which he had been

particularly interested, because he had some slight acquaintance with

its commander.
"I heard by wire only yesterday, Mr. Smith, that a gunboat had been

sent from Brisbane to the relief of your friends. She started three

days ago, and can't possibly reach the wreck until to-morrow at

earliest. But surely she will be there before you?"
"Not if I can get off soon, and don't meet with an accident on the

way. It's nearly two thousand miles from here to Ysabel Island, I

think?"
"I can't tell you within a hundred or two, but it's about that. When

do you think you will get there?"
"About midday to-morrow, with luck. I shall take on here enough petrol

to last the whole way, if I'm not thrown out of my course or meet with

mishap; but I suppose I can get a fresh supply at Port Moresby, if

necessary?"
"I very much doubt it. And what about getting back?"
"I'm going on as soon as I've seen that my people are safe—if I'm not

too late. I've got to rejoin my ship at 9 a.m. on Friday morning, or I

run the risk of being hauled over the coals."
"Surely not. They will make allowances, seeing what your errand has

been."
"They don't make allowances easily in the Navy, sir. Besides, I've set

my heart on being back in time."
"You will return this way, then. Ysabel Island is this side of the 180

degree line."
"Well, no, sir. Having started, I mean to get round the world if I

can."
"You're a sportsman, I see. Well, now, what will your best course be?"
He opened a map.
"I've planned it all, sir," said Smith hurriedly. "I go on to Samoa:

I'm sure to find petrol there; then Honolulu, San Francisco, St. Paul,

and St. John's, all big places, where I shall be able to get all I

want. Now, sir, I know Sunday night must be an awkward time, but, with

your assistance, I daresay I can get the petrol from Mr. Mackinnon's

store."
"There is a little difficulty which we shall have to get over. We've a

very strict regulation against entering at night any godown

containing explosives, owing to the risk of fire. Mr. Mackinnon's

godown will be locked up; his Chinaman will have the key; and as

Resident I can't openly countenance a breach of the rules. We have had

a great deal of trouble to enforce them, and any relaxation would have

a very bad effect on the Chinamen: they wouldn't understand it."
"Don't you worry about that, sir," said Mr. Martin. "Leave it to me.

There'll be a fine to pay to-morrow," he added, with a chuckle; "and

you can make it pretty stiff as a warning to the Chinese; it'll be

paid on the nail, I assure you."
"Very well, Mr. Martin. I shall know nothing about it officially until

you come before me to-morrow, and I'll read you a severe lecture in

addition to fining you. You can come to me for a subscription

afterwards. Good-bye, Mr. Smith: good luck. I sincerely hope you'll

find your friends safe and sound. Give my kind regards to Lieutenant

Underhill."
Smith left the Residency with Mr. Martin, who led him to the Chinese

quarter of the town, a dark assemblage of small huts, pig-sties, and

poultry runs.
"I don't know where Mackinnon's boy lives," said Mr. Martin. "We shall

have to hunt him up."
All the huts were apparently in darkness, and Smith, as he walked

rapidly beside his guide, thought that he preferred the smell of

petrol smoke to the mingled odours that assailed his nose. At length

they discovered a light amid the gloom, and hastening towards it,

discovered that it proceeded from an oil-lamp within one of the huts,

the door of which was open. Here they saw a group of Chinamen

squatting on the floor, engaged in playing a game with small figures

carved in bone.
"Hi, boys," called Mr. Martin; "can tell where Ching-Fu keeps?"
"My tellee massa," cried one of the younger men, rising. "My go long

that side, show wai-lo."
"Come on, then: chop-chop."
"Allo lightee, massa: my savvy."
He led them through what appeared to Smith an intricate maze of narrow

alleys, and presently pushed open the door of a hut, and called the

name of Ching-Fu, entering without ceremony. The Englishmen heard

voices raised as in altercation, and after some minutes the guide

reappeared, followed by a burly compatriot, rubbing his eyes.
"He catchee sleep, say what for come fetchee this time."
"Now, Ching-Fu," said Mr. Martin, "this gentleman wants seventy

gallons of petrol, at once. Mr. Mackinnon got a cable about it

yesterday. Come and get the cans, and have them taken up to my house

at once."
"No can do, massa," replied the man in a shrill tone of voice, that

seemed singularly unbefitting to his massive frame. "Topside man

catchee my inside godown this time, ch'hoy! he makee big bobbely."
"Never mind about that. I'll pay the fine."
"No can do, no can do so-fashion. Massa pay squeeze; all-same, my

catchee plenty bobbely, makee my too muchee sick."
"I'll take care you don't suffer. Come along: there's no time to

lose."
"This time Sunday, look-see, massa. No workee Sunday, no fear; that

joss-pidgin day."
"I can't waste time talking." Smith whispered in his ear. "Yes; Mr.

Smith will give you ten shillings for yourself if you hurry up."
"Ch'hoy!" cried the other man. "Massa numpa one genelum; my go long

too, Ching-Fu. No can catchee ten bob evely day."
Ching-Fu suffered himself to be persuaded. He beat up three or four of

his neighbours, and proceeded with them to the godown, the Englishmen

following to ensure that no time was lost. In half-an-hour the

necessary supplies of petrol and lubricating oil were being wheeled up

on trucks towards Mr. Martin's house. On the way Smith noticed a

number of reddish lights at irregular intervals, moving in the same

direction, and there were more people in the streets than when he had

come down, all hurrying one way.
"By Jingo!" said Mr. Martin, "the news has spread, and it looks

uncommonly like a torchlight procession. Hullo, Jenkins, what's the

matter?"
"That you, Martin?" replied the man addressed. "Everybody's talking

about an aeroplane that's come down somewhere near Mackenzie's shed,

and I'm off to see if it's true. Haven't you heard about it?"
"I did hear something of the sort. I'll be up there, too, by-and-by."
Smith was a little annoyed at the possibility of being delayed by a

crowd of spectators, but there was evidently no help for it. He

returned to Mr. Martin's house, being assured by his host that he need

have no anxiety about the safe delivery of the petrol.
Meanwhile Rodier, on Smith's departure, had, as usual, set to work to

clean the engine. He was tired and sleepy, and he would have been more

than human if he had not thought that his employer had rather the best

of the arrangement. But any private soreness he might have felt did

not affect the speed or the thoroughness of his work. He first of all

examined the wires: there was nothing wrong with them. Then he

unscrewed the plugs and laid them on top of the engine, pulled the

engine over, and finding that there was a poor spark, concluded that

it was rather sooty. After cleaning the parts thoroughly with petrol,

he again started the engine. The sparking being still weak, he

examined the magneto: it was choked with grease. The next thing was to

clean the brush with petrol and try the plugs again. The spark was now

strong, and after giving everything a final polish, he replaced the

plugs, satisfied that the engine was in good working order.
Switching off the searchlight for economy's sake, and leaving only the

small light that illuminated the compass, he sat down, opened a tin of

sardines, and began to eat them with biscuits. A fastidious person

might have objected to the mingling of flavours, olive oil and petrol

not combining at all well; but Rodier was too old a hand to be dainty.

He was in the act of munching a mouthful when his head dropped forward

on his breast, and he fell into a sound sleep.
He was wakened by a voice in his ear. Jumping up with a start, he

beheld a crowd of people watching him, men in Sunday coats, men in

shirt sleeves, ladies in light dresses, boys in knickerbockers and

Norfolks, girls in pinafores, Chinamen in coats of many colours, many

of the throng holding torches and lanterns.
"Ah! mille diables!" he cried. "Keep back! This is not a penny

theatre."
"Nor yet a cook-shop," said one of the visitors, with a laugh; "though

you might think so."
And then Rodier saw that the men and boys foremost in the group

carried plates, dishes, bowls, bottles, jugs. One had a dish of

chicken patties, another a plate of bananas, a third a bowl of

Devonshire junket, a fourth a loaf of bread; others had cheese,

apples, bottled beer, Australian wine, doughnuts, pork sausages,

sponge cake, ham sandwiches; in short, all the constituents of a high

tea except tea itself.
"Thought you might be hungry after your ride," said one. "Have a

sandwich?"
"Have a banana?" said another. "You won't get 'em like this in

London."
"Dry work, ain't it?" said a third, pulling a cork. "That'll buck you

up."
"Please take one of my doughnuts," piped a small boy, creeping around

the right leg of a sturdy planter.
"Ma foi! This take the cake," cried Rodier, laughing heartily. "Thank

you, thank you, thank you! But truly I shall be very—very

discomfortable if I eat all this riches. Ah; this is good, this is

hospitality. My friends, I thank you, I love you; vive l'Australie!"
Bubbling with excitement, he shook hands with this one and that; and

both hands being engaged at once in this hearty mode of salutation, he

would have been able to enjoy little of the good fare provided had

not one of the group begun to fend off the enthusiastic visitors.
"That's enough," he said; "give him breathing space. Eat away, man;

the junket won't keep; everything else will, and you can take with you

what is left."
Thus, when Smith arrived on the scene, he found his man surrounded by

an alfresco confectioner's shop, eating, laughing, talking, and

breaking forth into eloquent praise of Australian hospitality.
"Ah, mister," he cried, as Smith joined him; "this is a country! We

are pigs in clover. There is here enough for a regiment of Zouaves."
Here a diversion was caused by the arrival of Mr. Martin's friends

with rifles and ammunition enough to equip a company of grenadiers.

Smith accepted a dozen rifles and two or three hundred rounds of

ammunition; and these had just been placed in the car when the

Chinamen arrived with the petrol. He implored the torchbearers to

stand back while the inflammable fluid was put on board. This was done

amid a buzz of excitement, everybody talking at once.
"Speech! speech!" cried some one in the crowd, and Smith, thinking the

shortest way out of his embarrassment was to comply, stood up in the

car and thanked his good friends in Palmerston for the warmth of

their reception, and their kindness in supplying his wants.
"You will excuse me from saying more, I know," he added. "I have

nearly two thousand miles still to go; my father is in great danger;

and we are already several hours behind time. I can't shake hands with

you all, but I shall never forget your kindness. Now, if you will

clear the course so that I can get a run-off, I will say 'good-bye,'

and hope that some day I may come back and not be in such a hurry."
His simple words were cheered to the echo. Then Mr. Martin and three

or four more pressed the throng back. The good people cheered again as

the machine ran forward and sailed above them, and Smith, as he looked

down upon the sea of faces lit up by the flaring torches until it

became a blurred spot of light, felt cheered and encouraged, and set

his face hopefully towards the starlit east.

CHAPTER XII
STALKED BY PIGMIES
 
Smith had noticed before leaving Palmerston that the wind had risen

  and was blowing steadily from the north-west. He was very anxious not

  to miss Port Moresby, the principal harbour in British New Guinea, for

  he hoped, in spite of what the Resident at Palmerston had said, to be

  able to replenish his stock of petrol there, knowing very well that

  among the smaller islands of the South Pacific the places where petrol

  was kept must be very few. He determined, however, if he should fail

  to make Port Moresby, to steer straight for Ysabel Island. If it

  turned out to be impossible to obtain petrol, he would have to resign

  himself to the inevitable, return to Australia on the gunboat that had

  been dispatched to relieve the castaways, and endure as

  philosophically as he might the consequences of overstepping his

  leave.
His course lay across the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria. By

daybreak, if he were able to keep up full speed through the night, he

should have passed the northernmost end of the Yorke Peninsula, and it

might then be possible to take his bearings by the group of islands in

the Torres Straits. On leaving these islands behind him he should soon

come in sight of the mountain chain running from the middle of the

Gulf of Paqua to the south-eastern extremity of New Guinea. He might

expect to sight these mountains from a very great distance, and in

particular, if he could distinguish Mount Astrolabe, the square,

flat-topped mountain lying behind Port Moresby, he would have no

further anxiety about his position.
The engine was working as well as ever, and by keeping over the sea,

Smith was able to avoid any gusts or cross-currents of air that might

be set up by irregularities in the conformation of the land. Taking

turns as usual with Rodier at the wheel, he was able to get a few

hours of sleep; about an hour and a half after daybreak he descried

the strange shape of Mount Astrolabe towering nearly four thousand

feet into the sky, and in less than a quarter of an hour afterwards he

came to the coast, a little to the west, as he judged, of Port

Moresby.
The aspect of the coast was far from inviting. There were long

stretches of mangrove forest lining the shore, from which unpleasant

exhalations arose, affecting his sense of smell even at the height of

a hundred feet. Beyond rose limestone hills, very scantily wooded,

with a plentiful crop of rocks and stones. There was scarcely a patch

of level ground to be seen. He came almost suddenly upon the port,

lying in a hollow of the hills, and for some time looked in vain for a

suitable landing place. The aeroplane, circling over the harbour, was

seen by the sailors on the ships and the people on the quays, and its

appearance brought all work to a standstill.
At length Smith discovered at the north end of the little town a spot

where landing was just possible if the descent was not endangered by

the wind. He felt more nervous than at any other time during his

voyage, and was on the alert to set the propellers working at the

first sign that the wind was too strong for him. To his great relief

he came safely to the ground, with no other misadventure than

collision with a huge eucalyptus tree at the edge of the clearing.

Without loss of time he made his way down to the town, and accosting

the first white man he met, asked to be directed to the residence of

the Administrator.
"You're a stranger, I guess," said the man, who had not seen the

aeroplane. "Come from Sydney?"
"No, from Port Darwin."
"Gosh! We don't often have vessels from there. How's my friend Mr.

Pond?"
"I don't know him."
"Well, that's real strange. I thought everybody knew Dick Pond; he's

lived there fifty years or more. Say, what's up?" he asked of a man

hurrying in the opposite direction.
"It's down. Didn't you see it or hear it?"
"Hear what?"
"The aeroplane."
"An aeroplane! You don't say so."
"It's a fact. Wonder you didn't hear it. It made a noise like a

thousand humming birds, and came down not half-a-mile over yonder.

Some German fellow, I shouldn't wonder, from Constantine or Finsch.

Hope we're not in for trouble; I'm off to see."
"So will I. Go straight on, stranger; you see that constable there?

Well, turn down by him, and you'll come to the Administrator's in

about five minutes."
Smith had taken off his overalls, so that his appearance attracted no

more than a passing glance from the sailors, clerks, merchants, and

natives whom he met hurrying towards the spot where the aeroplane had

descended. He found the Administrator's house without difficulty. Not

having a card, he gave his name and rank at the door. The

Administrator was at breakfast with his family when Lieutenant Smith

was announced. Imagining that a war vessel had unexpectedly put in at

the harbour, he rose and went to the door to greet his visitor and

invite him to his table. A look of disappointment crossed his face

when he saw a dirty, unshaven object before him, dressed in stained

brown serge, offering no resemblance to the trim spick-and-span

officer he had expected to see.
"I'm sorry to trouble you, sir," said Smith, "I'm in need of some

petrol, and—"
"I don't keep petrol," said the Administrator shortly. "You've come

here by mistake, no doubt. There's no petrol for sale in the port, to

my knowledge."
"That's awkward. I'm afraid I must go on without. The aeroplane

uses—"
"The aeroplane! What aeroplane?"
"I've come from Port Darwin in my aeroplane, and am going on at once

to the Solomon Islands. I think I can just about manage it, so I won't

detain you any longer, sir."
"Come now, let me understand. You have come from Port Darwin—by

aeroplane! Where is it?"
"About half-a-mile beyond the town, sir."
"But—from Port Darwin—across the sea?"
There was nothing for it. Once more Smith retailed the outline of his

story, the Administrator listening with growing amazement. In the

midst of it a young Englishman came up, out of breath with running.
"Good morning, sir," he panted. "An aeroplane has just come down;

people say it is a German. What had we better do?"
"Keep our heads, I should think," said the Administrator. "Mr.

Williams—my secretary—Mr. Smith. The aeroplane is Mr. Smith's, and

has come from Port Darwin in ten hours. Just run down to the harbour,

Williams, and tell Captain Brown to send up all the petrol there is in

the launch, and a few gallons of machine oil as well. Be as quick as

you can."
The secretary opened wide eyes.
"Where's it to be taken, sir?"
"To the aeroplane, as quickly as possible."
The young man ran off, looking as though he had received a shock.
"This will give us excitement for a twelve-month, Mr. Smith," said the

Administrator. "It's lucky I can help you. I have just returned from a

tour of inspection, and there are a few gallons of petrol in my

motor-launch: not very much, I'm afraid, but better than nothing. I'm

afraid I was rather short with you just now, but you'll admit that

there was some excuse for me."
"Don't mention it, sir."
"It's the queerest thing I ever heard in my life; in fact, I'm only

just beginning to believe it. Come in and have some breakfast; it'll

be an hour or more before they get the petrol up, and I'd like my wife

and youngsters to hear about it from your own lips. You'd like a wash,

eh? Come along."
He led the way to his bath-room, turned on the water, arranged the

towels, and bidding Smith come to the first room downstairs on the

left when he was ready, he went off to prepare his family for the

guest.
Smith was by this time used to the exclamations of wonder, the volleys

of questions, the compliments and gusts of admiration which his story

evoked. He came through the ordeal of that breakfast-table with the

coolness of a veteran under fire. His hostess asked whether sailing in

the air made him sea-sick; her elder son wanted to know the type of

engine he favoured, the quantity of petrol it consumed per hour, and

what would happen if he collided with an airship going at equal speed

in the opposite direction. The younger boy asked if he might have a

ride in the aeroplane; the girl begged Smith to write his name in her

album. The governess sat with clasped hands, gazing at him with the

adoring ecstasy that she might have bestowed on a godlike visitant

from another sphere. Presently the Administrator said—
"Now get your hats on. We'll take Mr. Smith up in the buggy and see

him off."
When they reached the aeroplane they found Rodier demolishing some of

the good things provided by Mrs. Martin, the centre of an admiring

crowd of curious white men and wonder-struck natives. Two Papuan

constables were patrolling around with comical self-importance. The

petrol had arrived. When it was transferred to the aeroplane the

Administrator insisted on drinking Smith's health in a glass of Mr.

Martin's beer, and then called for three cheers for the airmen. His

daughter had brought her kodak and took a snapshot of them as they sat

in their places ready to start. The natives scattered with howls of

affright when the engine began sparking, the constables being easily

first in the stampede, one of them pitching head first into the

eucalyptus. The engine started, the men cheered, the women waved

handkerchiefs, and as the aeroplane soared up and flew in the

direction of the coast the whole crowd set off at a run to gain a

position whence they might follow its flight with their eyes.
For some time Smith steered down the coast, intending to cross the

Owen Stanley range as soon as he saw a convenient gap. After about

twenty miles, however, he ran with startling suddenness into a

tropical storm. It was as though he had passed from sunlight into a

dark and gloomy cavern. Rain fell in torrents, and he knew by the

extraordinary and alarming movements of the aeroplane that the wind

was blowing fiercely, and not steadily in one direction, but gustily,

and as it seemed, from all points of the compass. For the first time

since leaving the Euphrates he was seriously perturbed. It was true

that the force of the wind did not appear to be so great as it had

been before his meeting with Monsieur de Montausé on the Babylonian

plain; but his situation was more perilous than then, for he was

passing over hilly country, and the vertical wind-eddies were

infinitely more difficult to contend with. To attempt to alight would

be to court certain destruction; his only safety was to maintain as

high a speed as possible, trusting to weather through. He judged by

the compass that the wind was blowing mostly from the south-east,

almost dead against him. Fearing lest the enormous air-pressure should

break the planes if he strove to fly in the teeth of the wind, he

decided to swing round and run before it for a time, in the hope that

it would drop by and by. As he performed this operation the aeroplane

rocked violently, and he thought every moment that it must be hurled

to the ground; but by making a wide circle he got round safely, and

keeping the engine at full speed he retraced his course, soon seeing

Port Moresby again, far below him to the left. He had no means of

exactly determining the rate at which he was now travelling under the

joint impulse of the wind and his propellers; but from the way in

which the landscape was slipping past him he thought the speed could

hardly be less than two hundred and twenty miles an hour.
It occurred to him now to increase his altitude, with the idea of

rising above the area of the disturbance. But he found that the

mountains on his right hand rose higher than he had supposed. In

proportion as he ascended, they seemed to rise with him. He saw their

snow-clad tops stretching far away into the distance, and became

conscious of a great difference in the temperature. He began to feel

dizzy and short of breath, and presently his eyes were affected, and

he saw everything as in a mist. When Rodier shouted that he was

feeling sick Smith at once checked the ascent.
The aneroid indicated a height of 8000 feet, and it was clear from the

greater steadiness of the machine that it had risen out of the stratum

of air affected by the storm. But Smith's satisfaction at this was

soon dashed by the discovery that there was something wrong with the

engine. It missed sparking, recovered itself for a minute or two, then

missed again. Smith looked anxiously below him. The nearest ground was

about a thousand feet beneath; on his right the mountains still rose

hundreds of feet above him, blocking the way to his true course.

Hoping that the failure in the sparking was only temporary, Smith

swung the aeroplane round, in order to take advantage of this calm

region of air and at least fly in the right direction. At the same

time he looked out anxiously for a spot to which he might descend if

the defect in the engine proved persistent.
In a very few moments it was clear that to continue his flight would

be no longer safe, and he prepared to glide. While he was searching

for a convenient landing place the sparking ceased altogether. The

whole country was rugged; below, almost wholly forest land as far as

the eye could reach; above, bare rocks or scrub, and at the greatest

altitude, snow. The aeroplane flew on for a little by its own

momentum, and Smith wasted a few painful seconds before, despairing of

finding level ground, he began to descend in a long spiral.
As he neared the ground, Rodier's quick eye detected a little river

cutting its way through the forest, and at one spot a widening of its

bed, due, probably, to the action of freshets. Here there was a narrow

space of bare earth, the only clear spot in the landscape, and even

this was surrounded with dense woodland. He pointed it out to Smith.

There was no room for mistake or misjudgment. Smith knew that if he

did not strike the exact spot the aeroplane must crash into the

forest that lined both banks of the river. Never before had so heavy a

demand been made upon his nerve and skill. But the severe training of

the Navy develops coolness and judgment in critical situations; his

long apprenticeship to aerial navigation enabled him to do the right

thing at the right time; and, thanks to the calmness of the air in

this lofty region, the machine answered perfectly to his guiding hand,

and settled down upon the exact spot he had chosen, the little open

stretch on the right bank of the stream, within eight or ten yards of

the water.
His hand was trembling like a leaf when he stepped out on to the land.

The teeth of both men were chattering.
"Mon Dieu!" cried Rodier. "That was a squeak, mister. Le diable de

machine! It seem I do nothing at all but clean, clean, all the way

from London, and yet—"
"And yet down we come, 'like glistening Phaethon, wanting the manage

of unruly jades,'" quoted Smith. "Still, we're safe, and I've known

men killed or lamed for life getting off a horse."
"But with the horse you have the whip, with the machine you have only

the rags to clean her with. Ah! coquine, I should like to flog you, to

give you beans." He shook his fist at the engine.
Smith laughed.
"Beans would suit a horse better, Roddy," he said. "Let's be thankful

the breakdown didn't happen while we were in the storm. That would

have been the end of us. Come on, we'll soon put things to rights.

This loss of time is getting very serious."
They set to work to discover the cause of the failure. As they

expected, the sparking plugs were completely clogged. Smith took these

down to the stream to give them a thorough cleaning, while Rodier

overhauled the other parts of the machine. When, after half-an-hour's

hard work, everything appeared to be in order again, they sat down to

snatch a meal, leaving the plugs to be replaced at the last moment.
While thus engaged, Smith scanned the surroundings with some

curiosity. The stream, in cutting its way through the hillside, had

hollowed it out in a gentle curve. The channel itself threaded the

base of a huge natural cutting, most of which was covered with trees,

only the middle part, where the torrent had laid bare a path, being

comparatively clear. All around were trees large and small, tall and

stunted, leafy and bare. As Smith's eye travelled upward, he noticed

about a hundred and fifty yards distant, almost at the top of the

gorge, a small ape-like form flitting across a part of the forest that

was a little thinner than the rest.
"See that, Roddy?" he said.
Rodier looked round.
"What, mister?"
"An ape, I fancy, perhaps an orang-outang. I know they infest the

forests of the Malayan archipelago, but I can't call to mind that

they're natives of New Guinea."
"All the natives of New Guinea are apes," said Rodier viciously. "At

Port Moresby they came round me like monkeys at the Zoo."
"There he is! Do you see him?"
Smith's hand stole mechanically to his hip pocket, where he kept his

revolver. Then he smiled, remembering that the chances of stopping an

orang-outang with a revolver bullet were about one in ten thousand.
"I don't see him, mister."
"He has disappeared. But, my word, Roddy, there's another, and

another—four or five; look at them, in the undergrowth yonder. I

don't like this. They're savage beasts if offended, and if they attack

us we shall be in rather a tight corner."
He rose, keeping his eye on the spot where the ape-like forms had

shown themselves for an instant, to vanish again. As his eye became

accustomed to the gloomy depths of the forest, he became still more

alarmed to see a number of black, apish faces at various points among

the thick undergrowth surrounding the clearing. Another form flitted

across the thin open space in which he had seen the first.
"By George! he's got a bow in his hand. They're men! This is worse

still. The orang-outang is bad enough, but he avoids men, I believe,

unless interfered with or alarmed. These forest savages are dead shots

with their arrows, and they'll look on us as intruders. If they're as

spiteful as most of their kind we shall have trouble. Get your

revolver ready, but we must pretend we haven't noticed them. You've

got to replace those plugs; do it as quickly as you can. Don't look

round; I'll keep guard."
He saw several of the savages pass across in the same direction as the

first, and now he noticed, what had escaped him before, that they were

diminutive creatures, certainly not more than four feet high. He had

clearly stumbled upon a settlement of forest pigmies. From what he had

read of pigmy races he knew that it required extreme patience and a

great expenditure of time to win their confidence. That was out of the

question now. His first impulse was to hail them, and try to make

friends of them by offering some small present; but he checked himself

as the thought flashed upon him that a movement on his part might

startle them and provoke a discharge of their tiny arrows, which were

probably poisoned. He could not doubt they had seen him long before he

had seen them, and had been for some time playing the part of silent

spectators, being kept at a distance, perhaps, by the aspect of the

strange object which they had observed descending among them from the

sky. It must be sufficiently alarming to their untutored eyes. But

after a time their dread seemed to be overpowered by curiosity or

hostility, and Smith saw, with alarm, that the little figures were

gradually drawing nearer, flitting silently as shadows from tree to

tree, and hiding themselves so effectually, even when they came to

closer quarters, that nothing but the flicker of a brownish form among

the undergrowth, or a round black head projecting from tree or bush,

betrayed their presence.
"Nearly done, Roddy?" he asked, without turning.
"Pretty near."
With an outward calmness that corresponded little to his inward

sensations Smith lit a cigarette, racking his wits for some means of

keeping the pigmies at a distance without provoking a cloud of arrows

or a dash in force. The half-circle was gradually becoming narrower.

He fancied that their silent movements were checked when he began to

smoke, and this suggested to him that an appeal to their curiosity

might hold them intent or awestruck until Rodier had finished his

task.
"How much longer, Roddy?" he asked quietly.
"Three minutes."
Smith did the first thing that occurred to him. He took a letter from

his pocket, tore it slowly into small pieces, and let the fragments

float away on the breeze. This device appeared to be successful for a

few seconds; but when the scraps of paper had disappeared or fallen to

the ground the pigmies resumed their stealthy silent advance. Smith

had another idea. Whistling the merry air of the "Saucy Arethusa," he

took two backward steps towards the aeroplane, seized a half-empty

petrol can, and strolled unconcernedly with it to the bank of the

stream, which at this point formed a slowly moving pool. As he went he

unscrewed the stopper, and on reaching the brink, he poured some of

the petrol into the water. Then taking two or three matches from his

box, he struck them together, and flung them into the petrol floating

on the surface.
The effect of his stratagem was immediate. The spectacle of water

apparently on fire was too much for the simple savages. For the first

time they broke their silence, and were seen rushing up the wooded

slope, uttering shrill cries of alarm. Only then did Smith become

aware how numerous they were. The whole forest seemed to be alive with

them.
"Done, mister," cried Rodier.
Smith hurried back to the aeroplane, noticing as he approached several

small arrows sticking upright in the ground close to it.
"They shot at you when you turned your back," said Rodier. "Shall we

fire at them?"
"No; leave them alone. I think they're scared now. But it's lucky I

thought of setting fire to the petrol, or they would certainly have

been upon us, and there's such a crowd of them that we might have been

done for. Set the engine working. The noise will keep them away."
With some difficulty they turned the aeroplane round to face down

stream, where there was a fairly level stretch of a few yards for

running off. Vaulting on board, they started, and in five or six

seconds the aeroplane was humming along a hundred feet above the

trees.

CHAPTER XIII
THE RESCUE
 
Smith had taken no account of the time he had lost, first by the

  storm, then by the overhauling of the engine; but, little or much, it

  increased the peril of his father, and lessened his own chance of

  accomplishing what he had set out to do. When an engine is always

  running at full speed, time lost can only be made up by reducing the

  length of stoppages, and Smith felt even this to be almost out of the

  question. As soon as he was once more afloat, he thought his best plan

  was to make for the coast again, and follow this without attempting to

  cross the mountains.
The storm had ceased; the engine was working smoothly, and, steering

south-east, Smith in a few minutes found himself again in the

neighbourhood of Port Moresby. Again he ran down the coast, but when

about half-way between the port and the extreme south-east corner of

the island he espied a gap in the mountain chain and sped through it,

almost exactly on the ten-degree line. He had to rise to a

considerable height, and was for some moments troubled by the masses

of snow-white cumulose clouds that lay beneath him, cutting off all

view of the ground. The vast expanse of cloud lay dazzling white in

the sunlight, with peaks and crags such as he imagined Alpine summits

must show. But though it appeared to be perfectly still, every now and

then he saw small jets of mist shoot upward, like water from a geyser,

and at such times the vertical currents affected the elevation of the

aeroplane. He soon crossed this cloudy sea, however, and in a few

hours reached the north-east coast of New Guinea, and knew that

nothing but an island-spangled sea separated him from his destination.
About noon he came in sight of the mountains of Vanguna Island to the

east of New Georgia. Ysabel Island lay beyond this, running from

north-west to south-east. His intention was to round Cape Prieto, the

south-eastern extremity of it, and search the eastern shore northward.

In another hour he saw Russell Island, a green gem in the ocean

southward, and beyond this, to the south-east, the peaks of

Guadalcanar. Another twenty minutes brought him abreast of Florida

Island, and he was heading up the Indispensable Strait, with Thousand

Ships Bay and the lofty peaks at the southern end of Ysabel lying on

his left hand.
All at once Rodier descried a cloud of smoke on the horizon far up the

strait. Lifting his binocular, he shouted excitedly—
"It is a gunboat, mister. She flies the British flag."
"We've beaten her!" cried Smith.
He was divided between pleasure at his success, and sorrow that the

castaways were as yet unrelieved, for he could not doubt that the

gunboat was the same that had been dispatched from Brisbane to their

assistance. Before many minutes had elapsed he had overtaken the

vessel. Slowing down and wheeling overhead, he saw that the aeroplane

was the object of wondering interest on the crowded deck.
"Ahoy, there! Who are you?" he shouted through his megaphone.
"Gunboat Frobisher, Captain Warren," came the reply. "Who are you?"
"Aeroplane without a name, Lieutenant Smith of H.M.S. Imperturbable,

bound for Ysabel Island to relieve Lieutenant Underhill."
"The dickens! That's my job! Where do you hail from?"
"From London, sir. I'm afraid I've beaten you by a neck."
"Great Scott! Is this the Admiralty's latest?"
"Not official, sir; I'm here in a private capacity. My father's among

the wrecked party. I'm on leave."
"So it seems. When are you due back?"
"On Friday morning."
"I'm sorry for you, then. But, goodness alive! when did you start? The

wreck was only reported four days ago."
"Started Friday morning, sir."
"Gammon!"
"Rasher to you, sir."
"You haven't lost much time, at any rate. What's your speed?"
"About a hundred and ninety. Whereabouts was the wreck, sir?"
"A hundred miles or so up the coast, according to the men of

Underhill's party with me."
"Then I'll bid you good-bye for the present. I'll tell him you're

coming."
"Hope you'll find him alive."
Waving a good-bye, Smith flew on at full speed. For twenty minutes he

did not attempt to follow the indentations of the coast, but set a

course parallel with its general trend. Then, however, he steered so

that, without actually tracing every curve of the shore, he was able

to survey it pretty closely. By dead reckoning and the assistance of

his chart he was able to check from minute to minute his approximate

position.
He had passed Mount Gaillard, and saw, some miles to the north, the

remarkable saddle shape of Mount Mahaga. Then he made a bee-line for

Fulakora Point. Rounding this, his course was to the north-west. The

coast was steep and precipitous; here and there were reefs, over which

the sea broke in white upward cascades, and he was at no loss to

understand how even the most skilfully navigated vessel might easily

come to grief. About forty miles from the extremity of the island he

flew over an immense lagoon, extending for several miles between

Ysabel Island and a series of islets and reefs lying off the shore.

From this point the sea was dotted with islets so numerous that it was

impossible, at his high speed, to identify them. But he recognized the

deep indentation of Marcella Bay, confirming his observation by the

conspicuous wooded islet rising some hundred feet from the sea at its

northern arm. He knew that the scene of the wreck must be within a few

miles of this point, and reduced his speed so that he might scan the

sea for any sign of the Albatross.
For some time he flew up and down, but failed to distinguish a

battered hull, a funnel, or any remnant of the vessel. It was plain

that she had been entirely broken up. This was perplexing. He wondered

how he was to discover the party, if they were yet alive. The island

itself appeared, from his position off the shore, to be an

impenetrable mass of forest. Flying in a little nearer, and going

dead slow, Rodier presently caught sight of a square fenced enclosure

within a few yards of the edge of the cliff. Smith steered directly

over it, descending to a height of about fifty feet, and then saw in

the middle of the space a long piece of navy tarpaulin, several

biscuit tins, a hammer, two or three hatchets, and other objects,

which only white men could have placed there. It flashed upon him in a

moment that the shipwrecked party had encamped here. But there was not

a human being in sight, and he felt a stabbing conviction that he had

come too late.
Sick at heart, he made up his mind to descend and examine the place

and its surroundings more closely. There was plenty of room for the

aeroplane within the enclosure. Coming to the ground, he stepped, with

Rodier, out of the car, each carrying his revolver. Now he saw, in

addition to the articles before mentioned, a good number of arrows at

various points, a few broken spears, a tomahawk of a rude kind. Here

and there, on the barricade and below it, there were dark stains.

These signs only increased his anxiety, but at the same time awakened

wonder. Why had the party left their fort? It seemed scarcely likely

that they had been overpowered in an assault, for there were no marks

of a struggle within the barricade, and if the savages had succeeded

in an attack they would certainly have appropriated all that they

could lay hands on; even the most trivial objects would be precious to

unsophisticated children of nature. Rodier suggested that the

castaways had been taken off by some passing vessel, and Smith,

catching at the hope, was beginning to accept this view, when, lifting

the tarpaulin, he found beneath it the papers of the Albatross, some

notebooks filled with jottings in his father's spidery handwriting,

and a few small cases that contained bits of rock, fossils, and other

specimens dear to the geologist, each labelled with the name of the

place where it had been found.
Smith was now thoroughly alarmed. He knew that his father, if he had

quitted the place voluntarily, would never have left behind these

fruits of his labours. Yet why was the fort deserted?
"Ah, bah! They have gone foraging," said Rodier, unwittingly hitting

on the truth.
"But they would never leave the place unguarded," replied Smith. "The

savages certainly attacked them; look at the arrows and spears. But

Mr. Underhill would not have yielded without fighting; yet there are

no dead bodies, not even the cut-up earth there would be if they had

had a tussle. I can't account for it any way."
"Well, mister, we better look them up."
"In the aeroplane, you mean?"
"Yes. They must be here, in this island, or not here. In the

aeroplane we search all over."
"It will be like looking for rabbits in bracken," said Smith, pointing

to the forest. "Still, we must try."
He sat down on a biscuit tin to think over the position and evolve a

plan. A random search might be mere waste of time. Starting with the

assumption that the castaways were still on the island, he said to

himself that they must have left the fort voluntarily, or there would

certainly be signs of a struggle. That they had left no one on guard

seemed to show that they were in no alarm, otherwise they would have

carried their belongings with them. His father, he knew, would not

abandon his note-books and specimens. Was it possible that they were

making reprisals on the enemy who had previously attacked them? But

even in this case they would hardly have left their fort wholly

undefended, unless in the heat of victory they had rushed out in

headlong pursuit, a rash movement which a naval officer would hardly

countenance. Besides, they were but ill-provided with arms. Had they

been enticed forth by the savages? In that case the savages would

surely have plundered the camp, unless—and now his thought and his

pulse quickened—unless there had not yet been time. Perhaps they had

only recently left the place. Then they could not be far away, and if

they had yielded to allurement there might still be time to save

them. He started up, and told Rodier, who had begun his customary task

of cleaning the engine, the conclusion to which he had come.
"We will ascend at once," he said, "and scour the neighbourhood. The

forest is thick, but perhaps there are clear spaces in it. Let us lose

no time."
They dragged the aeroplane to the inner extremity of the enclosure,

turned it round, and started it towards the sea. In less than a minute

it was two hundred feet in the air. Then Smith wheeled round and

steered across the camp, intending to take that as a centre, and

strike out along successive radii, so that in the course of an hour or

two, even at moderate speed, he would have searched a considerable

extent of country in the shape of a fan. It was a question how far he

should proceed in one direction, but relying on his idea that the

evacuation of the camp could only recently have taken place, he

resolved to content himself at first with a distance of about ten

miles.
Having risen to a height of about three hundred feet, he found that he

commanded a view of many miles of the country. Far to the south were

the mountains; all around was forest, broken here and there by patches

of open rocky ground. Beneath him the trees were so densely packed

that a whole army might have been encamped among them without giving

a sign of its presence. He sped in a straight line west-north-west of

the fort, at a speed of between forty and fifty miles an hour; to go

faster would have rendered careful exploration of the country

difficult. Having completed ten miles without passing over a single

spot of clear ground, he flew about five miles due west, then turned

the machine and steered back towards the fort along the next imaginary

radius of his circle. He had arranged that Rodier should scan the

country to the left while he himself kept as good a look-out to the

right as was possible when he had engine and compass to attend to.

They had not flown far on this backward journey when Rodier, who was

using his binocular, shouted that he saw, on a headland far to the

left, what appeared to be a native village. Smith instantly steered

towards it. It was the first evidence of human habitation they had as

yet come across, and even at the risk of losing his bearings he must

examine it. He could now afford to go at full speed, and a few minutes

brought him above the village, which was a collection of rude huts

perched on a steep headland overlooking the sea, and defended on its

inland and less precipitous side by barriers of stakes. The noise made

by the engine as the aeroplane swept down towards the village first

drew all the inhabitants from their huts into the open enclosure, and

then sent them scampering back with shrieks of alarm as they saw the

strange object in the air. A glance sufficed to assure Smith, as he

wheeled round the village, that it contained no white men, unless they

had been taken inside the huts, which was unlikely. Without loss of

time he steered as nearly as he could towards the point at which he

had diverged from his settled course, and returned to the camp,

pausing once to examine a small tract where the trees were somewhat

thinner, allowing him to see the ground beneath.
Once more he started, steering now in a more westerly direction. There

were several clear spaces along this radius, and Smith flew over them

slowly, more than once wheeling about to make sure that his eyes had

missed nothing. But at these times he saw no human beings, nothing but

the wild animals of the forest, huge pigs being diminished to the size

of rabbits, and dingoes to the size of mice. These scurried away when

they heard the noise of the engine, and Smith hovered around for a

time to see if the flight of the animals attracted the attention of

men, but in vain.
Having again covered ten miles, as nearly as he could judge, he swung

round to the southwest. A minute or two later he came to the largest

open space he had yet seen, clear of undergrowth as well as of trees.

There were no huts upon it, and at first he saw no sign of men; but

all at once Rodier cried that there was a ladder against one of the

trees on the farther side of the clearing. Flying towards it, and

descending until the aeroplane was level with the tree-top, Smith was

amazed to see a brown woman, with a brown baby under her arm,

scuttling down the ladder towards the ground. At the same time he

became aware that there were ladders against many of the trees in the

neighbourhood, and women and children were descending by them, showing

all the marks of terror. He had come upon a collection of the curious

tree-houses, sixty or seventy feet from the ground, which some of the

islanders inhabit. The terrified people when they reached the ground

fled into the forest. There was no man among them, which led Smith to

suspect that the men were either hunting for food, or were perhaps

fighting with the castaways. Instead of returning directly to the

camp, therefore, he pursued his flight across the forest in the same

direction in which the startled natives had run. Now for the first

time he wished that he could have had a silent engine, for then his

ears might have given the information which failed his eyes. Though he

flew to and fro for some time in the vicinity of the tree-houses, he

discovered no other break in the forest; and the impossibility of

knowing what was going on beneath that vast screen of foliage began

to affect him with hopelessness of success.
He wished it were possible to descend in the clearing, and continue

his search on the ground. The appearance of the aeroplane was so

terrifying to the islanders that he need fear no opposition to his

landing. But the idea occurred to him only to be at once dismissed.

When once among the trees, away from the aeroplane, he would be no

longer sacrosanct. Those islanders who had actually witnessed his

descent might fear him as a denizen of the sky; but any others that

met him in the forest would not be restrained by superstitious fear

from, treating him as an enemy. Further, having once involved himself

in the obscure and pathless depths of the forest, he might wander for

hours, or even days, without finding the aeroplane. It was an

impossible course of action. Hopeless as he was becoming, he felt that

he could do nothing better than persevere as he had begun; after all,

he had as yet covered only a small wedge of the segment he had

proposed to himself.
But he now found himself in a difficulty. In the excitement of his

recent discovery he had neglected to keep a watch upon the compass,

and he was now at a loss to know the precise direction in which to

steer. He must certainly go to the east, but he could not tell whether

he was north or south of the camp. It occurred to him that by rising

to a greater height he might probably be able to descry the camp, so

he planed upwards until he attained an altitude of nearly two thousand

feet, Rodier searching the country seawards through his binocular.
"I see it!" he cried at length, adding, as Smith began to steer

towards it, "Wait a minute, mister; I see all the country better here;

I can pick out the clearings, though they are only dark blots; but yet

I can do it."
He swept the country for miles around. Beyond the forest, far to the

west, there were stretches of rugged uplands, bare of vegetation. It

was not at all likely that the Englishmen had gone so far from their

camp, whether willingly or unwillingly. To the east and south-east

stretched the sea, and Rodier declared that he saw, an immense way

off, the smoke of a steamer, no doubt the gunboat. Lowering the glass

to scan the nearer prospect, he suddenly gave a lusty shout.
"I see smoke, mister; a quite little smoke, as of a cigarette."
"Where?" asked Smith eagerly.
"South-east of us, in the forest, about five or six miles off."
"We'll go and see what it comes from."
Smith scarcely dared to hope that the discovery of the smoke would be

of any assistance to him. But it was the first indication of a camp

within the forest, whether of the islanders or of his friends, and he

could not neglect to investigate it. The aeroplane flew along at the

speed of a swallow. In little more than three minutes it reached the

twine of smoke. Checking the engine, Smith wheeled the aeroplane round

until it passed slowly over an extensive gap in the forest. He looked

down. The smoke rose from a fire in the midst of the clearing. At a

little distance from it there was a throng of islanders, gazing up

awe-struck at the strange apparition whose approach had been heralded

from afar, and which now circled above them, making terrifying noises.
But Smith was not interested in the islanders. He peered among them

and around for white men. He felt a shock of bitter disappointment;

all the upturned faces were brown. But the movement of the aeroplane

brought him to the verge of the forest, and then Rodier gave a shout

of delight.
"There they are! There they are, mister!" he cried, pointing obliquely

downwards.
Smith looked over. In the shade at the foot of the trees he saw a

number of men bound each to a trunk. Their faces, directed upwards,

were too darkly shadowed for him to distinguish their race; but they

were clothed. Beyond doubt they were the castaways.
In a moment he determined what to do. While the aeroplane circled

slowly above their heads the islanders would feel no more than awe

and wonder. They huddled together like a flock of sheep in a

thunderstorm, probably not as yet connecting the aerial visitant with

their prisoners. What was required was to scatter them, suddenly, in a

way that would smite them with terror, and cause them to flee without

thought of the captives helpless against the trees.
Smith sailed away eastward, disappearing from their sight. He had made

a quick mental calculation of the extent of the clearing. Rising to

the height of about three hundred feet above the ground, while still

out of sight he suddenly stopped the engine and warped the planes for

a dive. The aeroplane descended rapidly, grazed the tops of the trees,

and then, more slowly, swept, silently, in a gentle curve towards the

throng of men, who were chattering about the mysterious sky visitor.

When they caught sight of it they were struck dumb, and for a few

moments seemed to be fixed to the ground with amazement. Then, as it

came directly towards them, and Smith set the noisy propellers in

motion, they uttered shrieks of dismay and terror, and fled like hares

into the forest.
Some of them started too late. Smith, being now near the ground, set

the engine going at low speed, overtook a group of the islanders

before they reached shelter, and with a touch of the aeroplane flung them violently on their faces. He then wheeled round, and rose

once more into the air in order to effect a complete descent. The

prostrate natives lay for some time in a paralysis of fear; but

finding that they were unhurt, and that the monster had withdrawn from

them, they picked themselves up, and ran to overtake their friends,

leaving the space clear.

SMITH OVERTOOK A GROUP OF THE ISLANDERS BEFORE THEY REACHED SHELTER.
Smith overtook a group of the islanders before they reached shelter.

In another minute Smith had brought the aeroplane safely to the

ground. Rodier and he sprang out and ran towards the bound figures.
"It's Charley!" called a voice, in tones wherein surprise and joy were

blended.
And then the sailormen, famished and feeble as they were, broke forth

in hoarse cheers and incoherent shouts, which died away in sobs.

CHAPTER XIV
SIR MATTHEW IMPROVES THE OCCASION
 
To cut the bonds of the prisoners was the work of only a few moments.

  The sailors, the instant they were free, made a rush upon the

  villagers' cooking-pots, their passion for food overcoming curiosity,

  gratitude, and all other sentiments. Dr. Smith gripped his son's hand,

  his emotion being too great for words. Tom slapped his brother on the

  back. Lieutenant Underhill was divided between his eagerness to learn

  all the circumstances of this strange intervention and his anxiety to

  prevent his men from getting out of hand. But a glance at them as they

  made free with the natives' provisions relieved him on this score, and

  when Smith explained that he had on board the aeroplane certain

  delectables in the shape of chicken patties (becoming rather stale),

  doughnuts, plumcake, a bottle of Australian burgundy, and sundry other

  remnants of the provisions furnished by the hospitable folk of

  Palmerston, he voted an immediate adjournment for lunch, and the

  officers, with the Smiths, were soon satisfying their clamant hunger.
"How in the world did you know about us?" asked Tom.
"By cable from Brisbane."
"Then our boat did not go down?" said Underhill.
"No; your men lost their sail and rudder, and drifted until they came

into the current along the south coast of New Guinea. They were picked

up by a barque bound for Brisbane, and carried there."
He gave them a rapid summary of his flight across the world. The

sudden change in their fortunes induced a readiness to find amusement

in the most trifling incident, and they laughed loud and long as he

retailed the little mishaps and the comic episodes of his journey.

Then Underhill in his turn related all that had happened since the

wreck, and all became grave again as he told of the capture in the

early morning after their night march, the wild orgy in which their

captors had indulged, the elaborate preparations they had made under

the direction of their sorcerer for the sacrificial rite to which

their captives were destined. But for the appearance of the aeroplane

he had no doubt that within a few short hours they would have been

massacred, and their skulls hung up at the entrance of the huts as

signal marks of the villagers' prowess.
"The poor wretches hate all white men," said Underhill, "and it can

hardly be wondered at. They are recruited to labour in our

plantations, and come back with ailments unknown to them until they

met the white man. They do not distinguish, and a geologist like Dr.

Smith—"
"Ah!" said the doctor anxiously; "my specimens!"
"They are safe, Father," replied Charley. "I saw them in your fort.

The fact that the place had not been looted gave me some hope that you

were still alive. I wonder that the islanders have not made hay of

everything."
"No doubt they deferred the performance until they had disposed of

us," said Underhill. "But now, how do we stand? You have saved us, but

you can't take us all off in your aeroplane."
"A gunboat is on her way here; I passed her; she will arrive soon."
"Hurray!" shouted the men.
"Your men are on her, Mr. Underhill," continued Smith. "She will

probably arrive by the time we get back to the fort."
"That is a difficulty. We must be at least seven or eight miles from

it, and the whole country is forest in which the natives may waylay

us. They have left our rifles, but practically all our ammunition is

gone."
"I have rifles and ammunition, as you see. But the savages have had

such a fright that I think they will keep out of the way of the

aeroplane. If I fly as low as possible over the trees they will hear

the humming and run away, and you can steer your course by the same

sound."
"A good idea. We'll burn their huts and weapons, as a warning to

behave better in future, and then we'll go."
This was done, Smith and Rodier appropriating as trophies several

spears and bows and arrows, and also some of the fetish charms hung at

the entrance to the huts. The crew, having satisfied their hunger,

hunted through the village for loot, and grumbled when they found

nothing that they considered worthy the consideration of British

sailormen. Then Rodier took the aeroplane aloft, Smith having decided

to walk with the rest, and the party set off towards the coast,

marching by the guidance of the sound that descended from the

tree-tops, dulled by its passage through thick layers of foliage.
The scare had proved effectual. Never a sign of the natives was seen

during the three hours' march to the fort. When they reached it, Dr.

Smith hastened at once to assure himself that his specimens and

note-books were safe. Tired out, the whole party lay down to rest.
"We'll go and meet the gunboat, Roddy," said Smith, when the aeroplane

alighted. "Captain Warren will be glad to hear that all is well."
They set off, flew down the coast, and in a few minutes descried the

gunboat, apparently about fifteen miles off.
"All well, sir," shouted Smith, as he met the vessel. "I'll pilot you

to the place."
"You have put my nose out of joint," replied the captain, "and done my

men out of a fight, too. Well, I'm glad Underhill is safe. How far

have we to go?"
"An hour will do it, sir. I'll keep you company; a jog-trot will be a

pleasant change after my scamper."
"Diable, mister," said Rodier; "that will waste an immense quantity of

petrol, and we have none to spare."
"You're right, Roddy. I daresay we have used in the last few hours

enough to carry us to Samoa."
He explained to Captain Warren the necessity he was under of

economizing fuel, and promised to fire a rifle as a guide to him when

the gunboat came abreast of the fort. Then he returned at full speed,

brought the aeroplane to the ground within the enclosure, and having

arranged with his brother to give the signal when the gunboat came in

sight, lay down beside Rodier and was fast asleep in an instant.
He was wakened by a roar of cheering when Captain Warren, with some of

his men, the four members of the crew of the Albatross, and a

corpulent little civilian about fifty years old, marched into the

camp, bringing a load of provisions. A huge bonfire was kindled in the

centre of the enclosure, and round it the whole company gathered to

enjoy a royal feast. Darkness had sunk over the land; the flames cast

ruddy reflections upon their features; and no one observing their

cheerful expression, or listening to their merry chat, would have

suspected that, a few hours before, half of the party had been face to

face with a terrible death. Smith was the hero of the day. Lieutenant

Underhill got up and proposed his health; the toast was drunk in wine,

beer, and water, and some wild dogs that had been allured from the

forest by the glare fled howling when the mariners raised their lusty

voices to the tune of "For he's a jolly good fellow." Nor was Rodier

forgotten. Tom Smith called for the honours for him also; he was

acclaimed in shouts of "Good old Frenchie!" "Well done, matey," and

sundry other boisterous tokens of applause.
Nothing would content the party but that Smith should tell the story

of his flight. They listened spell-bound as he related his

experiences at the various stopping-places, and his adventures at sea.

When the story was finished, the cheers broke out again, and the stout

little man who accompanied Captain Warren's party, and whose

spectacles gleamed with good humour, rose to his feet and cleared his

throat.
"Pray, gentlemen, silence for Sir Matthew Menhinick," said Captain

Warren, with twinkling eyes. Sir Matthew was an ex-prime minister of

Queensland, known to his intimates as Merry Matt, and to the whole

continent as a jolly good fellow. Being at Brisbane when the news of

the wreck came, he instantly decided to join Captain Warren's rescue

party. If he had a weakness for hearing his own voice, what could be

expected in a man whose speeches filled volumes of legislative

reports, but who was now in his retirement, deprived of these daily

opportunities of addressing his fellow men?
"Gentlemen," he said, beaming on the company; "officers and gentlemen,

and able seamen of His Majesty's Navy, I am a plain, blunt chap, I am,

as you all know, and I can't dress up what I've got to say in fine

language like the Governor-General, but I can't let this occasion pass

without saying a word or two about the great, the wonderful, the

stupendous achievement of our friend, Mr. Thesiger Smith. (Loud

cheers.) This is a proud moment in my life. I remember when I was a

nipper in London, before any of you were born except our friend the

doctor, I saw in a place called Cremorne Gardens a silly fellow of a

Frenchman—present company excepted—try to fly with wings strapped to

his arms. Of course he came a cropper and broke his back. I remember

my dear old mother shaking her head and telling over to me that fine

bit of poetry:

Cows and horses walk on four legs,
Little children walk on two legs;
Fishes swim in water clear,
Birds fly high into the air;

and impressing on me that boys mustn't be little beasts, nor try to be

fishes, or birds, or anything else they wasn't meant to be. But now,

gentlemen, in this wonderful twentieth century, them old doctrines are

as dead as Queen Anne. We've got submarines diving and roving along in

the depths of the sea; we've got aeroplanes that fly up into the air;

and we've got men, gentlemen, men of grit and backbone, men of courage

and determination, that 'fear no foe in shining armour,' men like our

friend Mr. Smith (roars of applause), who brave the perils of the deep

and the chance of the empyrean, who take their lives in their hands

and think nothing of it. Some croakers will tell you the Old Country

is going to the dogs. Don't you believe it. ("We won't.") I don't

believe she ever will go to the dogs while she's got left a man of the

old, honourable, and respected name of Smith. (Laughter and cheers.)
"Mr. Underhill just now referred in feeling terms to the personal

results of Mr. Smith's enterprise. But for him, some of our number

would by this time have crossed the bourne whence no traveller

returns. I need not speak of the joy and pride that must have filled a

father's and a brother's breast—" (Here the speaker blew his nose and

wiped a mist from his spectacles. Then he resumed.) "As I was saying,

our friend has accomplished a wonderful feat, gentlemen. He has come

twelve thousand miles in three days and a half. That's a thing to be

proud of. He tells me he's going to get back in another three days and

a half. I am sure I speak for you all when I say 'good luck to him!'

("hear! hear!") Think what it means, gentlemen. It means going round

the world in a week. When I was last in England I met a man at a hotel

who kept me up till three in the morning proving to me that the earth

is flat. I'll give Mr. Smith his address, and when he gets home he can

go and prove to him that he's a flat. (Laughter.) You remember in a

play of Shakespeare there's a little chap that says he'll put a girdle

round the earth in forty minutes. His name was Puck, gentlemen. Mr.

Smith won't do it quite so quick—not this journey, at any rate—but

who knows what these young scientific fellows will be a-doing of next?

Mr. Smith's aeroplane hasn't got a name, I believe, but he'd better

christen it Puck, which is the same as the Indian word pukka, and

means 'jolly good.'"
"Now I'm not going to make a speech, so I'll just conclude these few

remarks by wishing Mr. Smith a safe journey home, quick promotion, and

a seat in the House of Lords. He's used to going up, and that's about

as far up as he can go."
When the cheering had ceased, the company crowded about the aeroplane,

and gazed at it as if by sheer hard staring they might discover the

secret of its speed.
While Rodier explained its working to some of them, Smith sat with the

officers, his father and brother, and Sir Matthew, discussing the

immediate future.
"You must be very tired," said his father. "Don't you think you have

better give up the idea of returning at once, and come with us? The

Admiralty will stretch a point if we cable an explanation."
"On no account, father," replied Smith. "I am going back. I had the

good luck to get here in time. That's all right so far. But after

coming through the air I couldn't stand a slow voyage back; it would

be like riding in a growler after a taxi. Besides, I confess I am out

to make a record. I can't make a name in geology, but why shouldn't I

go down to posterity as the first man to fly round the world?"
"In seven days, as Sir Matthew remarked," added Tom. "It will be

rather a feather in your cap, old fellow, if you can do it."
"Oh, I'll do it, if only my engine holds out. By the way, Roddy ought

to be cleaning up in preparation for starting. I hope he won't be

demoralized by this ovation. Roddy," he called, "it's time to clean

up."
"All right, mister," replied the French man. "I'll take the shine out

of her."
"Roddy's English is not perfectly accurate," said Smith, laughing;

"but he's exactness itself in his work." He pulled out his watch.

"It's exactly eighty-one hours since I left London; I've got

eighty-seven to get back in."
"How will you go?" asked Underhill.
"First to Samoa, then Honolulu, then 'Frisco, and straight across the

States."
"You'll have to beware of interviewers," said Tom. "You may be sure

the newspaper men have got wind of you by this time."
"I don't know. Barracombe wouldn't say anything; I don't think Johnson

in Constantinople would, and—"
"My dear fellow, don't make any mistake," said Captain Warren.

"Nobody ever does say anything, but the newspaper men somehow or other

know what you think about when you're abed and asleep."
"They must all be Irishmen, then."
"Or Americans. I wouldn't mind betting that they are getting up a

reception for you at 'Frisco—"
"But they don't know I'm going there."
"No matter; the word has gone out to keep a watch for you, and every

town in the States will be on the qui vive. I'm rather sorry for you

when you come down for petrol; you won't get off so easily as you did

on the way out."
"Of course you won't," said Tom. "I suppose you'll wire ahead for

petrol to be held ready for you? That will give you away."
"No, I shall chance it. I can get petrol in any town in the States,

and I won't risk delay by announcing myself."
"You had better have a good sleep before you start," said Underhill.

"What time do you want to go?"
"Not later than midnight."
"Well, you've got nearly four hours. Your man had better sleep, too.

I'll see to the engine."
"Roddy won't allow that. I see that he has got help. He'll be finished

in half-an-hour. By all means put him to bed then, if you'll promise

to wake us both in good time."
"I'll do that. I won't spoil sport. Go to the further end of the camp,

and I'll tuck you up in the tarpaulin, put some food on board, and see

that everything is shipshape."
Smith was glad enough to avail himself of the opportunity of three or

four hours' continuous sleep on land. Rodier showed more reluctance,

declaring that he was as fit as a fiddle; but Captain Warren bore him

away from the crowd of admirers, and stood over him until he, like his

master, was sleeping soundly.
A quarter of an hour before midnight the two airmen were awakened.

Farewells were said, hands were shaken all round, every one wish them

good luck, and precisely at twelve they took their seats and set forth

on the two thousand miles flight to Samoa.

CHAPTER XV
HERR SCHWANKMACHER'S CABBAGES
 
A little before twelve on Monday, Herr Rudolph Schwankmacher, one of

  the most respected residents of Apia, capital of Samoa, was reclining

  under the shade of a plantain in his garden beyond the promontory of

  Mulinuu, enjoying the conversation of a friend and the refreshing

  bitterness of a bottle of light lager beer. The garden rose a few feet

  above the level of the ground in front of it, and afforded an

  excellent view over the sea. Hither Herr Schwankmacher was wont to

  retire for a brief spell of rest and meditation in the heat of the

  day, and on this occasion he had been accompanied by a compatriot

  newly arrived from Germany, to whom he was expatiating on the

  pleasures of colonial life in general, and in particular on the

  delights of rearing cabbages in so rich and prolific a soil.
"Yes," he said, "you will find no cabbages like these in Germany. You

see them. They are grown from seed. It is not a month since I put the

seed in the ground, and the plants are already flourishing. They will

soon be full-grown, and then I shall pickle them, and have for every

day in the year a dish that will remind me as I eat it of the days of

my youth in the dear Homeland. Ach! the Homeland; it is very dear. I

love it, although I would not return to it for the world. This is the

happy land, my friend. It is a fairland. It is a beautiful land for

copra, flowers, and cabbages. I am content."
He tossed off a glass of beer and lay back on the green sward, puffing

at a pipe and gazing benignly up into the broad-leaved canopy that

sheltered him from the midday sun. For some time he reclined thus,

dropping a word now and then to his companion, answering his

questions, but always returning to the cabbages.
As they lay in this placidity and ease they were suddenly aware of a

slight buzzing in the air. Herr Schwankmacher raised himself on his

elbow, and looked around for the insect that had dared to intrude into

this peaceful cabbage-patch. There was no insect in sight of such a

size as to account for the deep-toned hum, which was growing louder

moment by moment.
"This is strange," he said. "I never heard such a noise before."
"I have heard it," said his friend. "I have heard it very close. The

last time was when Count Zeppelin's airship came down in the

Teutoberger Wald. I was there."
"So; but Count Zeppelin would not be here in Samoa. We have no

airships here. The newspapers say that there is much activity in

Europe, especially among the French and English, in this new pastime,

but I dare say the greater part of what they say is lies. But really,

the noise is becoming very great; I am unable to explain it."
Both men were now sitting erect, looking to right, to left, seawards,

landwards, towards the hills. All at once the sound ceased, a shadow

was cast upon them, and before they could realize the situation a

strange, uncouth object glided from behind them over the plantains,

and came to rest in the centre of the cabbage-patch.
Herr Schwankmacher sprang to his feet with a nimbleness surprising in

a man of his size, and rushed forward, snorting with rage and

indignation. His friend followed, neither indignant nor enraged, but

very much interested in the occurrence. His intelligent eyes gleamed

behind his glasses; he had himself experienced aerial adventures.
It chanced that Rodier was the first to step out of the machine. As

the burly, bearded, white-clad figure of Herr Schwankmacher cantered

heavily toward him, he lifted his cap, and with that sunny smile

which had accompanied him through life, he said—
"Monsieur, je vous fais mille excuses. Voudriez-vou bien me dire ou

l'on puisse obtenir de la pétrole."
"Sapperment!" cried the infuriated German. "Es ist ein kriechender

Franzose!"
It was well that Rodier did not understand him, or, never having been

called a sneaking Frenchman before, he would certainly have fallen

tooth and nail on the offender, though in respect of bulk the German

would have made two of him. Fortunately for the keeping of peace, he

was quite ignorant of the German tongue, and when Herr Schwankmacher

proceeded to shake his pipe at him, and deliver his opinion of

trespassers in general and French trespassers in particular, with

intermittent allusions to cabbages, Rodier only listened with the same

gentle smile and deprecating movements of his grimy hands.
Smith, joining him, addressed Herr Schwankmacher in English, but his

intervention seemed only to add fuel to the flames. The German knew no

English; neither Smith nor Rodier knew German; and the affair promised

to come to a deadlock. But here a peacemaker stepped in. Herr

Schwankmacher's friend, who appeared to be greatly amused, stepped

forward with a noticeable limp.
"Gentlemen, gentlemen, zis is not business. Permit me, sir," he said

to Smith.
He took Herr Schwankmacher by the arm, and spoke a few words to him;

upon which the German consented to be silent and in dudgeon resumed

his pipe.
"My friend, sir," the second man went on, "is vat you call chippy

because you come plomp into his bed of cabbage, very fine vegetable,

vich remind him of his youthful days in ze ever-to-beloved Homeland."
"Oh, well," said Smith, "assure him that I am very sorry. I didn't

mean to hurt his cabbages, and I'll pay for any damage that I've

done."
"Was sagt er?" said Herr Schwankmacher suspiciously.
His friend translated Smith's words. Schwankmacher grunted.
"The fact is," continued Smith, "we've run short of petrol, and I had

to come down. I hoped to make Apia; that is it, yonder, I suppose?"
"Zat is so. You vant petrol. Zen I introduce you to excellent firma

vat supply ze Commandant. It is good petrol; I know it, for ze firma

receive large consignments of it from ze highly respectable firma I

haf ze honour to represent—Schlagintwert Gesellschaft of Düsseldorf.

Sir, viz compliments."
He took from a capacious pocket a bulky book in a red paper wrapper.
"Zis is our price list, sir, revise and correct. Ve can supply anyzink

vatefer, and I shall esteem it great favour to haf ze opportunity to

quote for petrol, machine oil, planes, stays, plugs, propellers,

levers, air-bags, goggles, overalls, accumulators—"
"Thanks, but at present I want nothing but petrol and machine oil, and

I must have them at once, as I have to start for Honolulu without

delay."
"For Honolulu, sir?"
"Yes."
"Across ze sea?"
"There's no other way, is there?"
"Sree sousand miles?"
"Rather less, isn't it?"
"Ach! zis knocks me into a—vat you call it?—into a billycock."
He turned to Herr Schwankmacher, who had just refilled his pipe, and

repeated to him the astounding announcement. The German scoffed.

Seeing that there was no help for it if he wished to get away in a

reasonable time, Smith explained that he was halfway on a voyage round

the world, and had not a minute to spare.
"Ach! business are business. Zat is vat take me round ze world. Permit

me, sir."
He handed Smith a large business card, inscribed with the name

"Hildebrand Schwab," and the address of his firm in Düsseldorf.
"Ve shall lose no time, sir," he added. "Zis is ze most amazing zink

zat efer haf I heard, and I esteem it great honour to haf ze

opportunity to introduce you to ze excellent firma vat supply you viz

petrol for your so vonderful machine. Vun minute until I tell Herr

Schwankmacher, zen ve go doublequick."
Herr Schwankmacher's vexation and incredulity vanished together when

his friend told him the facts of the case. He was a good fellow at

bottom, and now that he knew that the aeroplane's descent in his

garden was purely accidental, he was ready to do all in his power to

speed the parting guest. In a few minutes Smith was hurrying along the

shore road with a German on either side, at his left the surf roaring

on the fringe of coral reef, at his right a screen of tufted palms and

plantations running up the lower slopes of the mountains. He soon came

to a collection of drinking-bars and stores, all bearing German names.

Herr Schwankmacher, now transformed into a cordial host, invited him

to drink a bottle of lager with him at one of the bars, but he excused

himself and followed Schwab into a large store where every sort of

requisite for machines was kept in stock.
The purchase of petrol proved to be a lengthy transaction, for Schwab

was impelled to tell the story to the store-keeper, he repeated it to

his clerks, they ran out to tell the neighbours, and the place was

soon thronged with Germans—merchants, clerks, sailors, stokers—all

eager to see the airman who was flying round the world. The store was

filled with smoke and gutturals. The purchase being at last concluded,

the cans were rolled to a motor lorry which lumbered along in the

direction of Mulinuu like a triumphal car at the head of a procession.

First came Smith with Schwankmacher on his right and Schwab on his

left; then a crowd of the German population, in which wealthy

merchants found themselves neighbours to grimy stokers, and youthful

clerks to the inevitable uniforms; the tail was formed of swarthy

Samoans, men and women, skipping boys and laughing girls with flowers

in their hair.
Rodier had cleaned the engine, and was eating his dinner among the

cabbages. He favoured the crowd with a pleasant smile, although some

were Germans, and because others were pretty.
The petrol was placed on board and the tank filled, Smith, with

long-suffering patience, replying to the questions of the

English-speaking spectators. All was at last ready for the start;

Schwab, who alone of the company had knowledge of the conditions, made

himself useful in clearing the course; and Schwankmacher positively

declined to accept payment for the plants which had been crushed under

the aeroplane, and those which were trampled by the spectators' feet.
When the airmen were in their places, Schwab limped up.
"Permit me to shake hands viz ze first circumnavigator of ze sky," he

said with effusion, "and to remind you zat my firma Schlagintwert vill

be most happy to supply you viz anyzink vatefer zat you need, and in

vatefer region of ze globe you may be, on receipt of postcard,

telegram, cable, or Marconigram. Hoch!"
His cheer was taken up by the crowd. The machine moved forward. Herr

Schwankmacher, stepping back, fell into the arms of a grinning stoker,

and a little native boy, shrieking with fright, ran head-first into

the corpulent frame of a merchant who was more stable in his copra

business than in his legs. The aeroplane flew up; the crowd watched

its ascension like adoring worshippers of some sky deity; and in three

minutes it was a mere speck in the cloudless blue.

CHAPTER XVI
A STOP-PRESS MESSAGE
 
Mr. John McMurtrie, editor of the Toronto Sphere, a capable

  journalist and a man of many friends, strolled into his office about

  three o'clock one Wednesday afternoon. His first extra edition was due

  at four, and it may seem that he had allowed himself a very short time

  for dealing with fresh items of news that had come to hand since noon;

  but he had an excellent assistant, who took a real interest in his

  work, so that there was no need for the editor to hurry his luncheon

  or the ensuing cigar.
"Well, Daniels," he said genially, as he entered his assistant's room.

He sat across a corner of the table, exhibiting a well-developed calf

neatly covered with golfing hose. "Is there anything fresh and frothy

on the tape?"
"Not much. A wire from 'Frisco about those flying men."
"You don't say so?"
"Here it is."
He handed the slip to his chief, who ran his eye over the message. The

words employed were few, but a journalist of McMurtrie's experience

instinctively covered the bare bones with a respectable integument,

and clothed this with a quite picturesque raiment by force of the more

ornamental parts of speech.
The substance of what he read was as follows: A cable message had

reached San Francisco from Honolulu in the afternoon of the previous

day, announcing that an aeroplane had alighted there about three

o'clock that morning, the owner, a Lieutenant Thistleton (so it was

corrupted) Smith declaring that he had come from Samoa in sixteen

hours, and was proceeding to San Francisco. He had left three hours

later, having waited only to take in a stock of petrol. On receipt of

this message the editor of every newspaper in the city had arranged

for a relay of reporters to be up all night and watch for the arrival

of this extraordinary machine. Shortly after midnight the hum of the

propellers was heard over Golden Gate, and a light in the sky

indicating the course of the aeroplane, a dozen journalists, in

motor-cars, rushed after it, but were hopelessly out-distanced. They

discovered it on the outskirts of the city. The airmen had already

landed. The reporter who was first in the race seized upon Lieutenant

Smith, and learning that he had only alighted to obtain more petrol,

rushed him back to the city in his car. His comrades and competitors,

on arriving, sought to interview the second man, whose name they had

not been able to ascertain; but he was very uncommunicative, being

occupied in cleaning the engine. Lieutenant Smith was back with petrol

in twenty minutes; in half-an-hour he was again on his way. This

extreme haste caused great disappointment to the airmen and civic

dignitaries of the city, they having risen from their beds on hearing

of his arrival to honour Lieutenant Smith with a reception. When they

reached the spot where he had descended, he had been gone some ten

minutes. In the race to meet him, one of the motor-cars collided with

an electric-light standard and was overturned, its occupant, Mr.

Aeneas T. Muckleridge, being carried to hospital in a critical

condition. Several San Francisco newspapers had published interviews

with Lieutenant Smith, one of them ten columns long.
Mr. McMurtrie chuckled as he read this dispatch in the shorthand of

the news agency.
"Bedad, 'tis worth a special editorial, Daniels. But why didn't we get

it before, man? It ought to have been in time for the morning

papers."
"You remember, sir, there's been something wrong with the line to-day

through the storm."
"So there has, indeed. Well, take out that stuff about the new British

tariff, and send Davis in to me."
He went into his room, sat back in his chair, pushed up his golfing

cap, and smiled as he meditated the periods of his editorial. In a few

moments a thin, ragged-headed youth entered with an air of haste and

terror. He carried a paper-block, which he set on his knee, looking

anxiously at the editor. Mr. McMurtrie began to dictate, the

stenographer's pencil flying over the paper as he sought to overtake

the rapid utterance of his chief. The article, as it appeared on the

second page of the Sphere an hour later, ran as follows:
HOCUS POCUS


      A hoax, or as our merry ancestors would have called it, a

      flam, is usually the most ephemeral and evanescent of human

      devices. Like a boy's soap bubble, it glitters for a brief

      moment in iridescent rotundity, then ceases to be even a

      film of air. It is unsubstantial as the tail of Halley's

      comet. On rare occasions, it is true, its existence is

      prolonged; many worthy people are beguiled; and some

      enthusiasts are so effectually hoodwinked as to persist in

      their delusion, and even to form societies for its

      propagation. But mankind at large is sufficiently sane to

      avoid a fall into this abyss of the absurd, and, having

      paid its tribute of laughter, goes its way without being a

      cent the worse.
      San Francisco appears to be the latest victim of The Great

      Aviation Hoax, and we shall watch the progressive stages of

      its disillusionment with sympathetic interest, or the

      development of its newest cult with sincere commiseration.

      Like many other phenomena, good and bad, this gigantic

      flam, it will be remembered, took its rise in the east. Its

      genesis was reported in Constantinople nearly a week ago:

      then at intervals we learnt that these mysterious airmen,

      one of whom with artful artlessness had adopted the plain,

      respectable, and specious name of Smith, had manifested

      themselves at Karachi, Penang, and Port Darwin

      successively. The curtain then dropped, and the world

      waited with suspense for the opening of the next act,

      though there were some who suspected that the performers

      had slipped away with the cash-box during the interval, and

      would never be heard of again. However, the curtain has at

      last rung up at the golden city of the west, and it is

      certainly a mark of the ingenuity of the concocters of the

      hoax that they allowed at least twenty-four hours for the

      passage of the Pacific. In another column we give an

      account of a visit to San Francisco, in the small hours of

      this morning, from which it will be seen that the city

      fathers narrowly escaped making themselves ridiculous, the

      flying men having wisely disappeared before the municipal

      deputation, hastily summoned from their beds, had time to

      make the indispensable changes in their attire. It need

      scarcely be hinted that there are many accomplished

      aviators in San Francisco who would take a jovial pleasure

      in lending themselves to this amusing hoax, if only for the

      chance of seeing their most reverend seniors in pyjamas.
      A glance at the itinerary of the alleged world tourists,

      coupled with a comparison of dates, will show how

      impossible it is for them to have covered the stages of

      their tour in the time claimed. Indeed, it is almost an

      insult to our readers' intelligence even to suggest this

      comparison. The record put up by Blakeney in his New

      York-Chicago flight was 102 miles per hour for six

      consecutive hours. If the flying men who are now asserted

      to have touched at San Francisco are the same as were

      reported by the Constantinople correspondent of the London

      Times on Friday last, a simple calculation will show that

      they must have flown for many days at a time at twice

      Blakeney's speed, with the briefest intervals for food and

      rest. It is not yet claimed that the alleged Smith and his

      anonymous companion have discovered a means of dispensing

      with sleep, or that they are content, like the fabulous

      chameleon, to live on air. Our children may live to witness

      such developments in the science of aviation as may render

      possible an aerial journey of this length and celerity; but

      so sudden an augmentation of the speed and endurance of the

      aeroplane, to say nothing of the more delicate mechanism of

      the human frame, demands a more authentic confirmation of

      the midnight impressions of the San Francisco journalists

      than has yet come to hand. In short, we do not believe a

      word of it, and our speculation at the moment is, what

      brand of soap or tinned meat, what new machine oil, or

      panacea for human ills, these ingeniously arranged

      manifestations are intended to boom.

"What do you think of that, Davis?" asked Mr. McMurtrie at the end of

six minutes' rapid dictation. It was his pardonable weakness to claim

the admiration of his subordinates.
"Bully, sir," replied the shorthand-writer timidly. As a matter of

fact, he thought nothing at all, his whole attention having been so

completely absorbed by his task of making dots and curves and dashes

as to leave no portion of his brain available for receiving mental

impressions. But the editor was satisfied. Telling the youth to

transcribe his notes and send the flimsies page by page as completed

to the printer, he took up his golf sticks, passed through the outer

office, instructing his assistant to read the proof, and departed to

his recreation.
There is an excellent golf course on the Scarborough Bluffs, the

rugged, seamed, and fissured cliffs that form the northern shore of

Lake Ontario, near Toronto. Boarding a trolley-car, Mr. McMurtrie soon

reached the club-house, where he found his friend Harry Cleave

already awaiting him.
"Hullo, Mac. Day's work done?" was Mr. Cleave's salutation.
"Indeed it is. The best day's work I have done for a good while."
"Then you are pitching into somebody or something, that's certain.

What is it this time?"
"Bubbles, my boy. Those flying-men are after spinning again. Some of

the 'Frisco men will have a pain within side of 'em when they read how

I have touched 'em up. Now then, Cleave, we've got the course to

ourselves. I'm sure I can give you half a stroke and a beating. 'Tis

your honour."
The consciousness of having touched up the 'Frisco men seemed to have

a salutary influence on Mr. McMurtrie's play. He was in the top of

form, won the first two holes, and was in the act of lifting his club

to drive off from the tee of number three, when a faint buzzing sound

from the direction of the lake caused him to suspend the stroke and

glance over the placid blue water. Far away in the sky he saw a dark

speck about the size of a swallow, which, however, grew with

extraordinary rapidity, and in a few moments declared itself to be an

aeroplane containing two men.
"Be jabers!" quoth Mr. McMurtrie, resting his club on the ground and

watching the flying machine with eyes in which might have been

discerned a shade of misgiving.
It was, perhaps, thirty seconds from the time when he first caught

sight of it that the aeroplane came perpendicularly above his head,

the whirring ceased, and the machine descended with graceful swoop

upon the well-cropt turf within fifty yards of the spot where the two

golfers stood. As soon as it alighted, Mr. McMurtrie handed his sticks

to the caddie, and, as one released from a spell, hurried to meet the

man who had just stepped out of the car.
"That's Toronto over yonder?" said Smith without ceremony.
"Indeed it is," replied McMurtrie, taking stock of the dirty

dishevelled figure. "Your name's not Smith?"
"Indeed it is!"
"Holy Moses!" ejaculated McMurtrie, and, to Smith's amazement, he

turned his back and sprinted at the speed of a race-horse towards the

club-house a few hundred yards away. He rushed to the telephone box,

rang up his office, and, catching at his breath, waited with feverish

eagerness for the answer to his call.
"You there, Daniels? I'm McMurtrie. For any sake stop press, cancel

that leader, put back the tariff, votes for women, anything, only

stop it.... What!... Edition off the machine!... Don't let a copy

leave the office.... What!... First deliveries made!... Recall 'em,

or the paper's ruined. Smith's here!... No, This-something Smith ...

no, you ass, the naval lieutenant, he flying man: don't you

understand!... understand!... are you there?... Get out a special

edition at once.... Where's Davis? Bring him to the 'phone to take a

note.... That you, Davis? Take this down.... 'As we go to press we

have the best of evidence for the statement that the marvellous

world-flight of that intrepid young airman, Lieutenant Thistledown

Smith, of the British Navy, is a sober fact, and not, as our sceptical

wiseacres have asserted, an ingeniously concocted hoax. Lieutenant

Smith descended at 3:50 this afternoon on the Scarborough Bluffs,

having accomplished the enormous distance from San Francisco without a

stop, in the marvellous time of twelve hours, twenty-one minutes, and

fourteen seconds. In our final edition, which will be accelerated, we

shall publish an interview with Lieutenant Smith, with exclusive

particulars of his remarkable voyage and his romantic career."
"I'm not so sure of that," said Smith dryly. He had entered with Mr.

Cleave, and heard the frenzied editor's concluding sentences. "To

begin with, I stopped at St. Paul, and was lucky enough to escape

without attracting any attention. I shouldn't have been here but for

the storm."
"For goodness' sake, Lieutenant, don't tell anybody that. A little

stop at St. Paul isn't worth making a fuss about. You'll come along

into the city with me, and we will get a few of the boys together and

give you a topping dinner."
"I'd rather be hanged," said Smith. "The fact is, I only came down to

get enough petrol on board to take me across the Atlantic. You can

tell me where to get what I want?"
"Indeed I can. I tell you what. I'll 'phone for the petrol—how much

do you want?—and get it out here in no time. You won't mind me

ringing up a few particular friends, and inviting them out to see

you?"
"Please don't do anything of the kind. I'm very tired; I'm not

presentable; and I've no time to spare."
"Sure you wouldn't be after declining to answer a question or two—to

be worked up into an interview, you know?"
"Really, I've nothing to tell. You appear to know a good deal about me

already, and I'm sure your imagination can supply the rest."
"But there's a gap, lieutenant. We can't account for you between Port

Darwin and Honolulu."
"We're wasting time," said Smith despairingly. "Be so good as to order

up the petrol; then I'll give you a few headings."
McMurtrie was delighted. He gave the order to a firm in the city,

requesting that the petrol should be sent out by motor at once. Then

he took Smith and Cleave into the luncheon-room, which they had to

themselves, ordered a meal for Smith, and drinks for Cleave and

himself, and while Smith was eating, filled his note-book with

jottings, which he foretold would sell out two editions of his paper

like winking.
Rodier, meanwhile, was cleaning the engine.
To execute an order smartly is one of the first of business virtues.

Smith was satisfied that the virtue was appreciated in Toronto: the

petrol arrived, as McMurtrie assured him, in the shortest possible

time. Unluckily the Toronto men of business had their share of

humanity's common failing—if it is a failing—curiosity. McMurtrie,

with Smith at his elbow, had scrupulously refrained from explaining

what the petrol was wanted for; his assistant, Daniels, had been too

busy seeing the special edition to press to run about gossiping; and

Davis, the shorthand-writer, the third in the secret, had become so

mechanical that nothing stirred emotion within him; he wrote of

murders, assassinations, political convulsions, Rooseveltian exploits,

diplomatic indiscretions, everything but football matches, with the

same pencil and the same cold, inhuman precision. But it happened that

one of the compositors in the Sphere printing office, who took a

lively interest in the affairs of his fellow mortals, had a bet with a

friend in the plumbing line about this very matter of the mysterious

flying men. No sooner had he set up his portion of the editor's note

than he begged leave of absence for half-an-hour from the overseer,

whipped off his apron, and rushed off to demand his winnings before

the loser had time to spend them in the Blue Lion on the way home

from work. They repaired, nevertheless, to the Blue Lion to settle

their account; they told the news to the barman, who passed it to the

landlord; a publisher's clerk heard it, and repeated it to the

manager; the manager acquainted the head of the firm as he went out to

tea; the publisher mentioned it in an off-hand way to the man next him

at the café; and—to roll the snowball no further—half Toronto was in

possession of the news before the Sphere appeared on the streets.
The result was a general exodus in the direction of the Scarborough

Bluffs. On foot, on bicycles, in cabs, motor-cars, trolley-cars,

drays, and all kinds of vehicles, every one who had a tincture of

sporting spirit set off to see two men and a structure of metal and

canvas—quite ordinary persons and things, but representing a Deed and

an Idea.
Thus it happened that close behind the dray conveying the petrol came

a long procession, the sound of whose coming announced it from afar.
"'Tis the way of us in Toronto," said McMurtrie soothingly, when Smith

vented his annoyance.
The crowd invaded the club-grounds, to the horror of the

green-keepers, and rolled past the club-house to the aeroplane, where

Rodier, having finished cleaning, was regaling himself with an

excellent repast sent out to him by Mr. McMurtrie. Cheers for

Lieutenant Smith arose; Rodier smiled and bowed, not ceasing to ply

his knife and fork until a daring youth put his foot upon the

aeroplane. Then Rodier dropped knife and fork, and rushed like a cat

at the intruder. The Frenchiness of his language apprised the

spectators that they were on the wrong scent, and they demanded to

know where Lieutenant Smith was. Knowing Smith's dislike of

demonstrations, Rodier was about to point lugubriously to the edge of

the cliff, when some one shouted "Here he is!" and the mob flocked

towards the club-house, from which Smith had just emerged. Rodier

seized the opportunity to finish his meal, and direct the operations

of the men who had brought the petrol.
Smith had not found himself in so large a crowd of English-speaking

people since he had left London. The early morning enthusiasm of the

San Francisco journalists was hard to bear, but the afternoon

enthusiasm of Toronto was terrible. Hundreds of young fellows wanted

to hoist him to their shoulders; dozens of opulent citizens perspired

to carry him to the city in their cars; some very young ladies panted

to kiss him; and a score of journalists buzzed about him, but upon

them McMurtrie smiled with a look of conscious superiority. Smith

whispered to him. The editor nodded.
"Gentlemen!" he shouted, holding up his hand.
"Silence!... Hear, hear!... S-s-sh!... Don't make such a row!...

Same to you!... Let's hear what Jack McMurtrie has got to say."
Thus the babel was roared down.
"Ladies and gentlemen," said McMurtrie; "Mr. Smith—"
"Three cheers for Smith!" shouted some one; horns blurted; from the

edge of the crowd the first notes of "For he's a jolly good fellow"

were heard, and they sang it through twice, so that those who had

missed the beginning should not be hurt in their feelings.
"Ladies and gentlemen," began McMurtrie again, when he could make his

voice heard, "Mr. Smith, who is rather hoarse from constant exposure

to the night air, asks me to thank you for the warmth of your

reception. He has been good enough to give me full particulars of his

wonderful journey, which you will find in the final edition of the

Sphere. As I've no doubt at all that you are anxious to have the

chance of seeing Mr. Smith performing the evolutions which up to this

time have been witnessed by next to nobody but the stars and the

flying fishes, he has consented, at my request, to give a

demonstration, provided that you'll allow him a clear run, and don't

be accessory to your own manslaughter."
This announcement was greeted with loud cheers. The crowd fell back,

allowing Smith a free course to the aeroplane.
"Bedad," said McMurtrie; "I wouldn't wonder but they tear me to pieces

before I get safe home. But I'll skip into a motor-car as soon as you

are started. Now, is there anything I can do for you before you go?"
"Only send two cables for me; one to my sister: here's the address;

say simply 'All well.' The other to Barracombe, 532 Mincing Lane,

London, asking him to meet me at home at eleven p.m., to-morrow. You

won't forget?"
"I will not. But you're a cool hand, to be sure."
A space was cleared; the aeroplane ran off, soared aloft, and for a

few seconds circled over the heads

[See Illustration]of the spectators. Then a voice

came to them from the air, not so much like Longfellow's falling star

as an emission from a gramaphone.
"Good-bye, friends. Thanks for your kind reception. Sorry I can't stay

any longer; but I've got to be in Portsmouth, England within

twenty-four hours. Good-bye."
The aeroplane wheeled eastward, and shot forward at a speed that made

the onlookers gasp. When it had disappeared, they became suddenly

alive to the suspicion that Jack McMurtrie had practised a ruse on

them. They gave a yell and looked round for him. A motor-car was

making at forty miles an hour for Toronto.

CHAPTER XVII
A MIDNIGHT VIGIL
 
Mr. William Barracombe was the most punctual of men. He entered his

  office in Mincing Lane precisely at ten o'clock on Thursday morning.

  His letters had already been sorted and arranged in two neat piles on

  his desk. Topmost on one of them was a cablegram from Toronto: "Meet

  me home eleven p.m. Smith." He never admitted that anything would

  surprise him, and in fact he showed no sign of excitement, but looked

  through his correspondence methodically, distributing the papers among

  several baskets to be dealt with by respective members of his staff,

  or by himself. This done, he rang for the office boy, ordered him to

  remove the baskets, and then took up the cablegram again.
"By Jove!" he said to himself.
He reached down his A B C and looked out a train for Cosham.
"I may as well go down to dinner," he thought.
His next proceeding was to telephone to his chambers instructing his

man to meet him at Waterloo with his suit-case. Then he wrote a

telegram to Mrs. Smith announcing that he would dine with her that

evening. Thereupon he was ready to tackle the business problems which

would absorb his attention until five o'clock.
On arriving at Cosham Park he was taken to the study, where Kate Smith

was awaiting him.
"You have heard from Charley?" she said anxiously, after shaking

hands.
"Yes. Have you?"
"He wired 'All well.' He is very economical. All his messages have

been just those two words, except yesterday's from Honolulu. That was

'Father safe.'"
"That's magnificent. He didn't tell me that, the rascal. Like you, I

have nothing before but 'All well.'"
"Do tell me what he wired you this time. I was afraid when we got your

telegram that something had happened."
"Not a bit of it. He expects to be here at eleven."
"How delightful! I am quite proud of him, really. You can come and see

Mother now. I wanted to speak to you first because she knows nothing

about Charley's journey. I thought it best to keep it from her until

I knew about Father, and having kept it so long I decided to leave it

for Charley to tell himself. I don't know whether I can manage it. I'm

so excited I could scream."
"Don't mind me. Ah! How d'ye do, Mrs. Smith?" The lady had just

entered. "You'll forgive my presumption?"
"Not at all—that is, an old friend like you doesn't presume, Mr.

Barracombe. Have you heard from Charley lately?"
"A word or two. He's coming home to-night. He asked me to meet him

here."
"How vexing! I mean, I wish I had known before; I can tell you what I

couldn't tell a stranger: we've fish for only three. But I am glad the

dear boy will have a few hours at home before he rejoins his ship. It

was very annoying that his leave should be spoilt. I am sure his

captain works him too hard."
"I don't fancy he'll consider his leave spoilt. But don't be concerned

about the fish; he won't be home till eleven."
"My bed-time is ten; I haven't made an exception for years; but I

shall certainly sit up for him; if you'll play cribbage with me to

keep me awake. We dine at eight. You know your room?"
A servant entered.
"Please, m'm, there's a man asking for Mr. Charley."
"Who is he, Betts?"
"A stranger to me, m'm. His name is Barton, and he's a farmer sort of

man."
"Did you tell him that Mr. Charley is not at home?"
"Yes, m'm. He said he'd wait."
"Tell him that Mr. Charley will not be in till eleven. He had better

call again."
The servant returned in a minute or two.
"Please, m'm, the man says he don't mind waiting. He has come miles

special to see Mr. Charley, and he says he won't be put off. He seems

a bit put out, m'm."
"I'll go and see him, Mother," said Kate. "It may be important."
"Perhaps Mr. Barracombe will go with you, my dear. The man may be

intoxicated."
Kate and Mr. Barracombe proceeded to the hall, where stood a man in

rough country garments, his calves encased in brown leather leggins.
"You wish to see my brother?" said Kate.
"I do so, if Mr. Charles Thusidger Smith, R.N., be your brother, miss.

He give me this card wi's name prented on it, and vowed and declared

he'd send me a cheque as soon as he got my bill for the damage he

done. 'Tis a week come Saturday since I sent my bill, and daze me if

I've got a cheque or even had any answer. That's not fair dealing; it

bean't proper; that's what I say."
Mr. Barracombe's eyes twinkled. He glanced at Kate, and said—
"Your name is B-B—"
"Barton, sir; Firtop Farm, Mottisfont."
"What is this b-b-bill for d-d-damages you speak of?"
"Why, sir, 'twas like this. Last Thursday night as was, I was just

a-strippin' off my coat to go to bed when I heard a randy of a noise

out-along, and my dogs set up a-barkin', and goin' to look, there was

a airyplane had shoved hisself into my hayrick, and a young feller

a-splutterin' and hollerin', and usin' all manner of heathen language

to my dog. He cooled down arter a bit, when I'd spoke to him pretty

straight, axin' who'd pay for the mess he'd made, and he went

down-along to village, sayin' he'd take a bed there for hisself and

his man, and pay me what was fair. Drown me if he wasn't back in

half-an-hour, all of a heat, tellin' me in a commandin' way—being an

officer by what he said—to pull down my fence and help him hoist that

airyplane on to the road. I wouldn't stir a finger till he'd promised

faithful to pay, not me; then we worked me and some labourin' men he

brought, till we was all of a sweat, and we got the dratted thing out,

and off she went, whizzin' and buzzin' in a way I never did see. Come

mornin' I took a look at things, and there was half my hay not worth a

cuss for horse or ass, and thirty feet of fence fit for nowt but

firewood. 'Send in your bill,' says he, and send it I did, and neither

song nor sixpence have I got for it. Thinks I, I'll go and see if he

give me a right name and address, and a mighty moil 'twas to find the

place, and no train back till mornin', and my wife don't know where I

be."
"Very annoying. What's the amount of your b-b-bill?"
"Here it be. Cast your eye on it, sir. I ain't overcharged a penny."
He handed Mr. Barracombe a soiled paper folded many times—"To damage

to hay, repairing fence, and cleaning up, £4 2s 4-1/2d."
"What's the ha'penny?" asked Mr. Barracombe.
"I never thowt there'd be any question of a ha'penny, drown me if I

did. The ha'penny be for the ball of twine we used to get fence

straight. I didn't want it set up all crissmacross, mind 'ee, and you

have to draw a line same as when you're plantin' 'taties."
"Well, Mr. B-B-Barton, I'm sorry Mr. Smith isn't at home, but the

f-fact is he's been for a voyage round the world, and won't be home

till eleven."
"That's a good 'un. Round the world! Why, I tell 'ee this was only a

se'nnight ago. I seed him myself. He couldn't get a half nor a quarter

round the world in the time. My son Jock be a sailor, and he don't do

it under six months. That won't wash with Isaac Barton. No, no, if

he'll be home at eleven he hain't been round the world. Anyway, I'll

bide till he comes. I dussn't show my face to home without £4 2s.

4-1/2d., railway fare extry."
"If that's the case I'd b-better p-p-pay you myself. Mr. Smith will

settle with me. Here's a f-f-five-pound note: that will pay your

b-b-bill and your f-fare, and leave something over for a b-bed in the

village if you can't get home to-night."
"Well now, that's handsome, be dazed if it hain't."
"Just receipt your bill, w-will you? By the b-bye, Mr. Smith didn't

pay you anything on account?"
"I won't tell a lie. He did. He give me a pound, but that don't come

in the reckonin'. Hay was £3, wood fifteen shillin', men's time

£1, beer two shillin', odds and ends five shillin', nails

four-pence, twine a ha'penny, makin' £5, 2s. 4-1/2d. I've a-took

off £1, leavin' £4 2s. 4-1/2d."
"Very well. Here's a s-stamp."
The farmer receipted the bill.
"Thank'ee, sir." He cleared his throat, "If I med make so bold, sir,

meanin' no offence—"
"What n-now?"
"Why, sir, speakin' in my simple common way, I never hears a body

stutter in his talk but I think of my brother Sam and how he cured

hisself. He was a terrible bad stutterer in his young days, he was,

nearly bustin' hisself tryin' to get it out, poor soul. But a clever

parson chap learned him how to cure hisself, and if I med make so

bold, I'll tell 'ee how 'twas done."
"I shall be d-delighted."
"Well, this parson chap—ah! he was a clever feller, everywhere except

in the pulpit—he said to my brother, 'Sam,' says he—he always talked

in that homely way—'Sam, poor feller, I'll tell 'ee what the bishop

told me when I stuttered so bad I couldn't say 'Dearly beloved

brethren' without bub—bub—bubbing awful. 'Say the bub—bub—bub

inside yerself,' says he, 'and then you can stutter as long as you

like without a soul knowin' it. My brother Sam thowt 'a med as well

give it a trial, and he did, and bless 'ee, in a week he could talk as

straightforward as the Prime Minister, and no one 'ud ever know what a

terrible lot of b's and m's and other plaguey letters he swallered.

Try it, sir; say 'Baby mustn't bother mummy' that way ten times every

morning afore breakfast, and 'Pepper-pots and mustard plasters' afore

goin' to bed, and I lay you'll get over it as quick as my brother

Sam. Good-night, sir and miss, and thank 'ee."
"Why do you pretend so?" said Kate, laughing, when the door was

shut.
"My dear Kate, I have stuttered for pleasure and profit ever since I

discovered the efficacy of it at school. When I didn't know my lesson

one day I put on a stammer, and my bub—bub—bubbing, as the farmer

calls it, made the master so uncomfortable that, ever afterwards, at

the first sign of it he passed me over. That's why I'm such a fool

to-day."
"You're incorrigible. Come, it's time to dress for dinner."
The time between dinner and eleven passed all too slowly. Mrs. Smith

and Barracombe played cribbage; Kate was restless, opening a book,

laying it down, touching the piano, going to the window and peering

out into the dark.
"Why are you so restless to-night, Kate?" asked her mother. "One would

think that Charley had been away for months instead of a week."
"Ah, but you see, Mother, he hasn't—"
"Hasn't what—Fifteen two, fifteen four—Well, Kate?"
"Has never been quite so late home on his last night of leave, has he,

Mother?"
"That is true—one for his nob. I really think they ought to make him

a captain, for he seems to be an exceedingly useful officer. He went

away last Thursday, as I understood, on some business connected with a

wreck. I do hope none of the poor men were drowned. I often think of

my husband, Mr. Barracombe, on the other side of the world, going

about among those dreadful coral reefs, and I wish he would retire and

live safely at home. I could never understand what he finds

interesting in bits of stone and things of that sort, but of course he

is a very distinguished man."
So the good lady prattled on, placidly unconscious of her nearness to

the border-line between comedy and tragedy.
The clock struck eleven.
"Thank you, Mr. Barracombe; I have enjoyed the game," said Mrs. Smith.

"Charley will soon be here."
"Let us go to the door," said Kate. "Perhaps we shall hear him."
"Mr. Barracombe will go with you, Kate; I am a little afraid of the

night air. Wrap yourself up."
The two went to the conservatory door, overlooking the park. The sky

was clear, the air was still; not a sound was to be heard. Every now

and then a broad flash of light fleetingly illuminated the sky; it was

no doubt the searchlight at Spithead.
"I wish he would come," said Kate. "It would be terrible if anything

went wrong at the very last. How far is it across the Atlantic?"
"It's three thousand five hundred miles to Liverpool from New York,

and rather more from Toronto; a ticklish journey, with no chance of

landing till he gets to Ireland."
"It makes me shudder to think of him crossing the sea in that frail

machine."
"People shuddered at the first railway train, speed ten miles an hour;

now we grumble at fifty. In a few years we shall have an aerial

Marathon, with the circumference of the globe for the course."
"Hark! What is that?"
"The rumble of a train," said Barracombe, after a moment's silence.

"Shall we walk down to the sheds? There's a clear view from there,

without trees; we could see the aeroplane a long way off, though

probably we should hear it first."
They went on, remained at the sheds for some minutes, scanning the

sky, then retraced their steps. A quarter-past eleven struck. Kate

grew more and more anxious, and Barracombe found it more and more

difficult to talk unconcernedly. They returned to the house, and

entering through the conservatory, discovered Mrs. Smith asleep in her

chair. Barracombe noiselessly put some coal on the fire, and they

stole out again.
Half-past eleven.
"Don't you think you had better go to bed, Kate?"
"I couldn't sleep if I did, Billy. I couldn't even lie still. Oh, how

helpless one feels! Charley may be drowning, and we don't know it, and

can't do anything to help."
"Pull yourself together, Kate. I am sure he is all right. He probably

started later than he intended. You may be sure he wouldn't start

unless the engine was in thorough good order. Let us go in and play

patience."
"No, no; I must move. Let us walk down the road."
Barracombe was more perturbed than he would admit. It was unlike Smith

to miscalculate. His telegram was probably sent off at the moment of

starting, or even after he had started, from Toronto. If the engine

had worked at all, it would work at full speed, so that the loss of

time on the journey implied either contrary winds, a mistaken course,

or a serious mishap. Kate was so little in the mood for talking that

Barracombe in responsive silence could toss the various probabilities

about in his mind until he felt a nervous excitability that annoyed

him.
They walked up and down the silent road. The church clock struck a

quarter to twelve. The minutes dragged until it was again heard. A

little after twelve they stopped short at the same moment; Kate

grasped Barracombe's arm.
"Listen!" she said.
A faint sound, like the murmur of the wind, but becoming louder with

extraordinary rapidity.
"Oh, Billy!" cried the girl. "Run; he'll be at the sheds first."
She caught his hand and tugged him towards the park gate, a hundred

yards distant.
"My dear Kate!" he protested; "I'm not so young as I was. Let him be

there first, confound him!"
But he ran all the same. The engine was roaring overhead,

fortissimo; looking up, the two panting runners saw the flashlight.

A sudden silence, as when the word tacet in an orchestral score

hushes to silence bassoons and horns, drums and cymbals, all the

instruments that but a moment before were convulsing the air with

myriad waves of sound.
"He's gliding!" cried Kate, standing breathless at the door of the

shed. The machine descended silently and rested on the smooth level

sward. Kate darted forward.
"Oh, Charley!" she cried; "you've come!"

CHAPTER XVIII
THE LAST LAP
 
"Rather late, ain't you!" said Barracombe, as Smith jumped from the

  aeroplane.
"Hallo, Sis. Hallo, old man!" cried Smith. "We've done it; seven days,

to the minute!"
Kate flew into his arms: only next day did she discover the ruin of

her dress.
"I've a voice like a corncake," said Smith, disengaging himself. "Glad

to see you, Billy."
"You're a wonder! But, God bless me! you look awfully done up. You

look positively ill. Come up to the house at once; we don't want you

crocked."
"Come on, Roddy," said Smith hoarsely. "You'll stay with us to-night.

Leave the machine for once. You see, Billy, I have to rejoin at nine

to-morrow—to-morrow, I say; I mean this morning. That gives me nine

hours, and as I haven't been to bed for a week I want seven good solid

hours sleep."
"But really, Charley, you don't look fit to rejoin," said Kate. "Your

cheeks are dreadfully thin, and your voice is nearly gone."
"Well, of course, I'm dead tired; feel all to pieces, in fact. But all

I want is sleep."
"And a medical certificate," put in Barracombe. "I've known a fellow

get two months' leave for what he called a strained heart. Strained it

to some purpose, for he got married before his leave was up. We'll get

you a certificate—a doctor's, not a parson's."
"I don't mind if you do, after I've rejoined; but I must show up

without fail at nine a.m. I'm later than I meant to be. Got snowed up

at St. John's."
"You didn't come straight from Toronto, then!"
"No. Didn't care to risk it. Besides, it would have meant eighteen

hours in the air at a stretch. I don't think Roddy and I could have

stood that. I took St. John's—in Newfoundland, Kate—on the way."
"But I thought Newfoundland was near the North Pole."
"A common mistake. St. John's is considerably southward of our

latitude. But they've had a cold snap there lately, and we came down

in a snowdrift and had to be dug out. We had an easy flight across the

Atlantic; the engine has behaved splendidly all through, thanks to

Roddy. But I'm glad to be home; by Jove, I am!"
This conversation passed as they walked up to the house. Mrs. Smith

had been wakened by the noise of the engine, and stood just within the

door to welcome her son. She, too, was struck by his haggard

appearance, and declared she must send for the doctor.
"Why, Mother, you're not going to coddle me at my age," he said. "You

ought to be in bed. Off you go: I shall be all right in the morning. I

shall have something to tell you then. Breakfast at eight sharp, by

the way; or I shan't get to Portsmouth in time."
"Very well, my dear. Simmons is up, keeping some food warm for you. I

will tell him. Goodnight."
"I've such loads to tell you," said Smith, when she had gone; "but I'm

afraid it must wait. By the way, Kate, I suppose nothing of importance

has come for me?"
"A few letters, mostly from the people you disappointed, I suspect.

I'll fetch them."
When she returned, Smith immediately noticed a long official envelope

in the bundle. He tore it open.
"Great Scott!" he cried. "An order to rejoin on Wednesday without

fail. That's a nasty whack."
"Any explanation?" asked Barracombe.
"Not a word. Some sudden whimsy of the admiral's, I suppose. Have you

got yesterday's paper, Kate?"
"I remember now," cried Kate. "How silly of me to forget it! The

Implacable broke down, and your ship was ordered to replace her."
"Just my luck!" exclaimed Smith gloomily. "Last time I was late the

ship was going shooting. Now I shall miss her altogether when she's at

manœuvres. Captain Bolitho will put me down as a hopeless rotter."
"What nonsense, Charley! You had seven days left, and you're not bound

to be within call at a moment's notice. I'm very glad the ship has

left Portsmouth, for now you can't rejoin, and you'll have time to

rest."
"I'm not so sure, Kate," he cried, suddenly sitting up, and scanning

the paper she had brought. "Where's the fleet? Ah! Irish coast. I'll

rejoin, as sure as I'm alive. You see, I'm due at nine. I'm not

physically incapable, and in the aeroplane I can easily do it if I can

find the squadron. The Implacable was with the Blue fleet, operating

from Bear Haven, I see. It's worth trying, anyhow."
"Magnificent, but absurd," said Barracombe. "You won't find them,

either."
"A fiver that I will."
"No, thanks. By the way, you owe me a fiver."
"How's that?"
"Look at this."
He handed Smith Farmer Barton's receipted bill, and related what had

happened in the evening.
Smith laughed.
"I'd forgotten him; but his bill is no doubt among this batch. To come

back to the point. I am serious. I mean to rejoin my ship at nine. To

give myself plenty of time I'll start at six. It's now past twelve;

I'll set my alarm clock for six. I'm sorry for Roddy, I'm afraid, he

must clean the engine. D'you mind finding him?—Ah! here he is, and

Simmons with soup. Thank you, Simmons. Sorry to keep you up so late."
"I'm glad to see you back safe and sound, sir," said the man

respectfully.
Smith shot a glance at Rodier, but the look of surprise on the

Frenchman's face showed that he, at any rate, had not been talking.

Kate's expression proved that she was equally surprised.
"And I hope the Master and Mr. Tom are as well as could be expected,

sir," added Simmons.
"What do you mean?"
"Well, sir, I knew the Master had met with a accident—"
"But I cut the paragraph out of the paper," cried Kate.
"Yes, miss, that's what made me go and buy one. I assure you I haven't

said a word to a soul, miss, guessing as you wanted it kep' from the

Mistress, and you can't trust female maids."
"But how did you know I had gone out to the Solomons?" asked Smith.
"'Twas a bit in the Times first put me on the scent, sir, about a

sensation in Constantinople about two daring and intrepid airmen that

came down there sudden-like and went away in a jiff. No names were

named, sir, but I guessed it was you and Mr. Rodier."
"Johnson had discretion, at any rate," murmured Smith. "Well!"
"Next day there was a bit about two airmen coming down at some place

in India, sir. Putting two and two together—"
"I see. No names again?"
"No, sir, not till to-night."
"To-night, eh?"
"Yes, sir. There's a bit in the Evening News to-night, not strictly

true, sir. I've got it here."
He drew the paper from his pocket, and pointed to the following

paragraph—
The mysterious airmen whose doings have been reported at

      intervals during the last few days have now appeared at San

      Francisco. One of them is said to be a Lieutenant

      Thistleton Smith, who, according to our correspondent,

      explained that he has a bet of £10,000 with a well-known

      sporting nobleman that he will circle the globe in a

      fortnight. The general opinion in San Francisco is that

      these sporadic appearances of airmen in far-distant spots

      are part of a cleverly devised scheme of world-wide

      advertisement, engineered by a Chicago pork-packing firm

      who have more than once displayed considerable ingenuity in

      pushing their products.
There was general laughter when Smith read this paragraph aloud.

Rodier alone was solemn.
"They think we boom pigs!" he cried indignantly. "Pigs themselves."
"Well, Roddy, truth will out," said Smith. "I'm sorry to keep you up,

by the way, but I shall have to leave at six o'clock. Would you mind

running down to the shed and—cleaning the engine?"
"Mon Dieu! I do nothing for a week but clean the engine."
"Yes, poor chap, but you shall have a rest after this. Go to bed when

you've got things shipshape; I shall go alone; only about four hundred

miles this time."
"You really mean it, then?" said Barracombe.
"Decidedly. If you knew Captain Bolitho you would see that there's no

help for it."
"Well, then, the sooner you eat your supper and get between the sheets

the better. I'll tuck you up."
"Tuck in and tuck up. Very well."
"Your bath shall be ready at six, sir," said Simmons.
A few minutes after six o'clock, Smith made his ascent, his departure

being witnessed by his sister and Barracombe and the whole domestic

staff. He flew rapidly over Hampshire, Dorset, Devon; crossed the

Bristol Channel, and made a bee-line for Bear Haven at the entrance to

Bantry Bay. Soon after eight he descried a number of dull grey specks

strung like beads on the western horizon. They must be one or other of

the opposing fleets, either the Reds or the Blues; but which? He must

go and see. Altering his course a point or two, in a few minutes he

was running down the line of warships, which were steaming line ahead,

apparently in the direction of Bear Haven. At a glance he recognized

the Thunderbolt, notoriously the lame duck of the Reds, lagging

three or four miles behind the rest. Smith slowed down to quarter

speed as he passed the leading ships, and a few blank shots were fired

at him for form's sake, for the guns were incapable of an inclination

that would be dangerous to him at his height of 3,000 feet, even if

they were throwing live shell.
He drew clear of the squadron, and was about to put his engine at full

speed again when an aeroplane shot up from the deck of the flagship

and started in pursuit, followed at a short interval by a second

aeroplane from a vessel some distance down the line. Smith smiled to

himself. From what he knew of the service aeroplanes, the Puck, as

he had now named his vessel, was in no danger of being overtaken; but

if the airmen of the Red fleet wanted a run, he was not the man to

baulk them. In a few minutes the pursuers began to close in; he

increased the speed to eighty miles; still they gained on him. Another

notch in the regulator increased his speed to a hundred miles an hour,

at which he felt that he should be able to hold his own. He found,

however, that one of the aeroplanes was still gaining, and it was not

until he had increased his speed another twenty miles that the Puck

began to draw away.
"Now to business," Smith said to himself.
Paying no more attention to the pursuers, except by a glance to assure

himself that, though hopelessly outstripped, they were still following

him, he searched the horizon ahead for signs of the Blue fleet. The

rugged coast of Cork county had been for some time in sight, and as

Smith was well acquainted with it from experience in former

manœuvres, he was able to steer straight for Bear Haven as soon as

the landmarks were distinguishable. It was more than half-an-hour

after sighting the Red fleet when he flew over Bantry Bay to the

harbour. Except for a number of colliers it was empty.
Smith had already decided on his course of action if he should find

that the fleet had put to sea. He would adopt the tactics that had

succeeded so well in Ysabel Island, searching, not the land this time,

but the sea, fanwise, while his fuel lasted. The position of the

colliers seemed to indicate that they had only recently been engaged

in coaling, so that in all probability the fleet had left that morning

and was not far away. Probably, too, it was in the open Atlantic, and

not sheltering in any of the innumerable inlets of the western coast.

He steered due west, noticing as he did so that the pursuers were

still doggedly on his trail, and had gained considerably while he had

been investigating the harbour.
He looked at his watch. It was twenty-five minutes to nine. He would

reach his ship in time if it were not more than eighty-five miles

distant, supposing that it was going in the same direction, or perhaps

a hundred and ten if it were coming towards him. Rising to the height

of 4,000 feet, he searched the sea in all directions through his

binocular. He noticed with amusement that one of the pursuing

aeroplanes had come down on Mizzen Head; the other was still labouring

after him. There were fishing smacks here and there near the coast,

looking like moths. Far to the left he saw a liner pouring its black

smoke into the air; it might have been a cockroach in widow's weeds. And there, far in the west, what is that? Smoke, or a cloud? In two

minutes there is no longer any doubt; in three minutes the shapes of a

squadron of battleships can be clearly seen; in five minutes Smith's

practised eyes, now that he has descended, can distinguish the

Imperturbable, flying the admiral's flag, among what to a landsman

would appear to be a dozen exactly similar vessels. Glancing back, he

sees that the Red Scout has changed her course, and is already only a

speck in the southern sky.

AEROPLANE ROUTE ROUND THE WORLD
Aeroplane route round the World.

It was precisely ten minutes to nine by Smith's watch when the Puck,

literally received with open arms by two-score sturdy tars, alighted

on the deck of the Imperturbable.
"Come aboard, sir," said Smith cheerfully to his captain.
"So I see," was the laconic reply.
"Sorry I was away, sir, when your recall arrived—in the South

Pacific."
"In the—what?"
"The South Pacific, sir, or thereabouts."
"Don't you think, Mr. Smith, you are going a little too far?" said the

captain sternly.
"Well, sir," replied Smith naïvely, "it was a goodish distance. But

I have managed to get back within my leave. Ten minutes to spare,

sir."
Captain Bolitho gasped.
"Do you mean to tell me, seriously, you have been to the South

Pacific?"
"Certainly, sir. I left home about midnight last Thursday, and got

back not quite nine hours ago. Went to the Solomon Islands viâ

Penang and Port Darwin, and come home viâ Samoa and 'Frisco."
"But—but—then you have been round the world, sir—in how long?"
"Seven days, sir. My leave expires at nine this morning."
Mechanically, like a man in a dream, the captain took out his watch.
"Twenty-five minutes past eight," he said. "You needn't have hurried

yourself. You've another half-hour by Irish time. Perhaps you'd like

to fill it up by a trip round Ireland," he added dryly.
Smith smiled. The first lieutenant broke in—
"Look-out reports, sir, another aeroplane was sighted behind Mr.

Smith's."
The admiral, who had been an amused auditor of the colloquy between

Captain Bolitho and his lieutenant, was a man of intuitions.
"There are no aeroplanes on this coast except the two with the Reds,"

he said. "Mr. Smith, you have now reported yourself for duty. Our

single aeroplane has broken down; we must impress yours for public

service. I will not ask you what you have seen; but you will at once

follow the strange aeroplane, and endeavour to find out the position

and course of the enemy's fleet."
In less than a minute Smith was in the air; in ten minutes he had

overtaken the Red aeroplane, flying high as he approached, and

hovering over his late pursuer, who made vain efforts to rise above

him. The immense engine power of the Puck gave her as great an

advantage over her rival in soaring as in horizontal speed. By the

rules of the manoeuvres the Red aeroplane was out of action as soon as

the Puck rose vertically above her. Wasting no further time, Smith

continued his course, and in half-an-hour sighted the Red squadron,

noted its strength and course, and in another half-hour was back on

the deck of the Imperturbable.
"I found the enemy, sir, about ninety miles S.S.E., eight battleships

and about a dozen scouts. Their course was west."
The admiral made a rapid calculation.
"By Jove!" he said, "they will catch Pomeroy before we join him. But

there's time yet. We can warn Pomeroy to meet us twenty miles

north-east of the spot previously arranged. I think, Captain Bolitho,

we may perhaps overlook Mr. Smith's little irregularity in joining if

he gives us a full account of his—er—experiences, after dinner

to-night."
"And the Reds, sir?"
"Before dinner, one or the other of us will be out of action. Whether

Reds or Blues, we shall have leisure to hear how Mr. Smith went round

the world in seven days."

POSTSCRIPT
The following extracts from the Press, neatly pasted in Kate Smith's

scrap book, have a certain historical and romantic interest for the

persons concerned, directly or indirectly, in the incidents of the

foregoing narrative.

      CONSTANTINOPLE, Friday.
      The appearance of an aeroplane this morning caused a

      considerable sensation. It descended in the old archery

      ground of the Sultans, to the terror of the juvenile

      population that now uses the Ok Meidan as a common

      playground. It contained two passengers, and though no

      authentic information is obtainable, it is rumored that the

      daring and intrepid airmen have made a rapid flight from

      Berlin, and are proceeding to Persia on a secret mission

      connected with the Bagdad railway.
      (From Our Own Correspondent.)
      BOMBAY, Monday.
      The natives of the Mekran coast are again showing signs of

      insubordination. The gunboat Penguin has just come into

      harbour, and her commander, Captain Durward, reports that

      on Saturday he discovered a crowd of Baluchis in the act of

      smuggling arms into an apparently innocent fishing-village.

      He landed a party of bluejackets half a mile east of the

      village, and swooped upon it simultaneously with an attack

      from the sea. The villagers scattered in all directions,

      but the ring-leaders were captured, together with a large

      number of rifles and ammunition. The coup reflects the

      greatest credit on this able and energetic officer.
 Later.
      The craze for aviation has at last broken out in India. Two

      airmen made a sudden appearance at Karachi on Saturday, and

      departed after a brief stay for the interior. They are said

      to be in the employment of the Nizam of Hyderabad, who is

      spending vast sums on his latest hobby.
      BRISBANE, Monday.
      News has just arrived by wireless from the gunboat

      Frobisher, off Ysabel Island, that the crew of the

      survey-vessel Albatross, which was wrecked there a

      fortnight ago, are safe. The party, it will be remembered,

      includes the famous geologist, Dr. Thesiger Smith. The

      message is very brief, and a reference it makes to an

      aeroplane is thought to be an error.—REUTER.
      SINGAPORE, Wednesday.
      The Penang correspondent of the Free Press

      telegraphs—"The barque Elizabeth put in to-day in tow of

      a steamtug of this port, and reported an extraordinary

      incident in mid-ocean. She was dismasted a fortnight ago in

      a cyclone south of the Andamans, and while drifting, fire

      broke out in the forehold, and was kept under with the

      greatest difficulty. Her plight was discovered and reported

      here by the driver of an aeroplane who was making a flight

      in the neighbourhood, and the tug was immediately sent to

      her assistance. Conflicting rumours are prevalent as to the

      identity of the aviator in question; Captain Bunce, of the

      Elizabeth, insists that the airman's name was Smith, but

      his account is rather confused, and the most generally

      accepted opinion is that he is an officer of the German

      navy, which has recently adopted the aeroplane for scouting

      purposes. On no other supposition can his presence so far

      from land be accounted for. Owing to the facts that he

      arrived in the night of Sunday and departed immediately, no

      trustworthy information is obtainable."—REUTER.

      TORONTO, Wednesday.
      The later editions of the Sphere contain a detailed

      account of the extraordinary world-flight accomplished by

      Lieutenant Thesiger Smith of the British navy, which sets

      at rest the rumours and speculations of the past week.

      Lieutenant Smith left London last Friday at 12.30 a.m.

      (Greenwich time), and arrived here this afternoon,

      descending on the golf links on Scarborough Bluffs. I will

      wire full particulars later.

      PARIS, Monday.
      The Cross of the Legion of Honour was to-day presented by

      the President of the Republic to M. Laurent Rodier, who

      accompanied your Lieutenant Thesiger Smith last month on

      his adventurous flight around the world. It is understood

      that the French Government has taken up the remarkable

      invention due to M. Rodier and his English confrère, and

      has offered M. Rodier the headship of a new State

      aeronautical department.
      THE NEGLECT OF GENIUS.
      To the Editor of the Spectator.
      SIR,—The paragraph in the Times of Monday relating to

      the honour awarded to M. Rodier, suggests sad reflections

      to a patriotic Englishman. We have not as yet heard that

      Lieutenant Smith's wonderful achievement has been in any

      way recognized by our government. Abroad, genius is

      fostered: here, it is slighted. How long shall such things

      be?—I am, Sir, etc.,
      PRO BONO PUBLICO.
      [We have repeatedly declared our hatred of Protection in

      every shape and form, so that we shall not be misunderstood

      when we say that we cordially endorse our correspondent's

      complaint. If the present Government, which in general has

      our hearty support, devoted as much energy to the

      cultivation of British Genius as it now devotes to the

      spoon-feeding of British Industry, we should have less

      reason to fear the growing menace of Socialism.—ED.

      The King has been pleased to confer the honour of

      knighthood on Lieutenant Charles Thesiger Smith.	  
R.N. THESIGER-SMITH—BUNCE.—On July 12th, at St. George's,

      Hanover Square, by the Rev. Canon Montague, uncle of the

      bridegroom, Sir Charles Thesiger Smith, Captain R.N., elder

      son of Dr. Thesiger Smith, M.A., F.R.S., to Margaret, only

      daughter of the late John Bunce, master mariner.
      AN AIRMAN'S WEDDING.
      An interesting announcement in another column recalls a

      romance of the air and sea. Sir Charles Thesiger Smith,

      whose famous flight round the world last year has not yet

      been repeated, was yesterday married to Miss Margaret

      Bunce, the lady whom he rescued in mid-ocean from a burning

      vessel, and carried with him to safety. Many notable people

      attended to witness the ceremony, and the presents include

      a gold scarf-pin in the shape of an aeroplane, the gift of

      the King.
