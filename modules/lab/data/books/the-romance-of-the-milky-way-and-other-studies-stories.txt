[pg vii]
INTRODUCTION
Lafcadio Hearn, known to Nippon as Yakumo Koizumi, was born

    in Leucadia in the Ionian Islands, June 27, 1850. His father

    was an Irish surgeon in the British Army; his mother was a

    Greek. Both parents died while Hearn was still a child, and he

    was adopted by a great-aunt, and educated for the priesthood.

    To this training he owed his Latin scholarship and, doubtless,

    something of the subtlety of his intelligence. He soon found,

    however, that the prospect of an ecclesiastical career was

    alien from his inquiring mind and vivid temperament, and at the

    age of nineteen he came to America to seek his fortune. After

    working for a time as a proof-reader, he obtained employment as

    a newspaper reporter in Cincinnati. Soon he rose to be an

    editorial writer, and went in the course of a few years to New

    Orleans to join the editorial staff of the "Times-Democrat."

    Here he lived until 1887, writing odd fantasies and arabesques

    for his paper, contributing articles and sketches

    [pg viii] to the magazines, and

       publishing several curious little books, among them his

       "Stray Leaves from Strange Literature," and his translations

       from Gautier. In the winter of 1887 he began his pilgrimages

       to exotic countries, being, as he wrote to a friend, "a

       small literary bee in search of inspiring honey." After a

       couple of years, spent chiefly in the French West Indies,

       with periods of literary work in New York, he went in 1890

       to Japan to prepare a series of articles for a magazine.

       Here through some deep affinity of mood with the marvelous

       people of that country he seems suddenly to have felt

       himself at last at home. He married a Japanese woman; he

       acquired Japanese citizenship in order to preserve the

       succession of his property to his family there; he became a

       lecturer in the Imperial University at Tōkyō; and

       in a series of remarkable books he made himself the

       interpreter to the Western World of the very spirit of

       Japanese life and art. He died there of paralysis of the

       heart on the 26th of September, 1904.

With the exception of a body of familiar letters now in

    process of collection, the present volume contains all of

    Hearn's writing [pg ix] that he left uncollected in

       the magazines or in manuscript of a sufficient ripeness for

       publication. It is worth noting, however, that perfect as is

       the writing of "Ultimate Questions," and complete as the

       essay is in itself, the author regarded it as unfinished,

       and, had he lived, would have revised and amplified some

       portions of it.
But if this volume lacks the incomparably exquisite touch of

    its author in its arrangement and revision, it does,

    nevertheless, present him in all of his most characteristic

    veins, and it is in respect both to style and to substance

    perhaps the most mature and significant of his works.
In his first days as a writer Hearn had conceived an ideal

    of his art as specific as it was ambitious. Early in the

    eighties he wrote from New Orleans in an unpublished letter to

    the Rev. Wayland D. Ball of Washington: "The lovers of antique

    loveliness are proving to me the future possibilities of a long

    cherished dream,—the English realization of a Latin

    style, modeled upon foreign masters, and rendered even more

    forcible by that element of strength which is the

    characteristic of Northern tongues. This no man can hope to

    accomplish, but even a translator

    [pg x] may carry his stones to the

       master-masons of a new architecture of language." In the

       realization of his ideal Hearn took unremitting pains. He

       gave a minute and analytical study to the writings of such

       masters of style as Flaubert and Gautier, and he chose his

       miscellaneous reading with a peculiar care. He wrote again

       to the same friend: "I never read a book which does not

       powerfully impress the imagination; but whatever contains

       novel, curious, potent imagery I always read, no matter what

       the subject. When the soil of fancy is really well enriched

       with innumerable fallen leaves, the flowers of language grow

       spontaneously." Finally, to the hard study of technique, to

       vast but judicious reading, he added a long, creative

       brooding time. To a Japanese friend, Nobushige Amenomori, he

       wrote in a passage which contains by implication a deep

       theory not only of literary composition, but of all

       art:—
"Now with regard to your own sketch or story. If you are

    quite dissatisfied with it, I think this is probably due

    not to what you suppose,—imperfection of

    expression,—but rather to the fact that some

    latent thought or emotion has not yet defined itself in

    [pg xi] your mind with sufficient

       sharpness. You feel something and have not been able to

       express the feeling—only because you do not yet quite

       know what it is. We feel without understanding feeling; and

       our most powerful emotions are the most undefinable. This

       must be so, because they are inherited accumulations of

       feeling, and the multiplicity of them—superimposed one

       over another—blurs them, and makes them dim, even

       though enormously increasing their strength....

       Unconscious brain work is the best to develop such

       latent feeling or thought. By quietly writing the thing over

       and over again, I find that the emotion or idea often

       develops itself in the process,—unconsciously.

       Again, it is often worth while to try to analyze the

       feeling that remains dim. The effort of trying to understand

       exactly what it is that moves us sometimes proves

       successful.... If you have any feeling—no matter

       what—strongly latent in the mind (even only a haunting

       sadness or a mysterious joy), you may be sure that it is

       expressible. Some feelings are, of course, very difficult to

       develop. I shall show you one of these days, when we see

       each other, a page that I worked at for months before

       the idea came clearly.... When the best result comes, it

       [pg xii] ought to surprise you, for

       our best work is out of the Unconscious."
Through this study, reading, and brooding Lafcadio Hearn's

    prose ripened and mellowed consistently to the end. In mere

    workmanship the present volume is one of his most admirable,

    while in its heightened passages, like the final paragraph of

    "The Romance of the Milky Way," the rich, melancholy music, the

    profound suggestion, are not easily matched from any but the

    very greatest English prose.
In substance the volume is equally significant. In 1884 he

    wrote to one of the closest of his friends that he had at last

    found his feet intellectually through the reading of Herbert

    Spencer which had dispelled all "isms" from his mind and left

    him "the vague but omnipotent consolation of the Great Doubt."

    And in "Ultimate Questions," which strikes, so to say, the

    dominant chord of this volume, we have an almost lyrical

    expression of the meaning for him of the Spencerian philosophy

    and psychology. In it is his characteristic mingling of

    Buddhist and Shinto thought with English and French psychology,

    strains which in his work "do not simply mix well," as he says

    in one of his letters, but "absolutely unite, like chemical

    [pg xiii] elements—rush

       together with a shock;"—and in it he strikes his

       deepest note. In his steady envisagement of the horror that

       envelops the stupendous universe of science, in his power to

       evoke and revive old myths and superstitions, and by their

       glamour to cast a ghostly light of vanished suns over the

       darkness of the abyss, he was the most Lucretian of modern

       writers.

In outward appearance Hearn, the man, was in no way

    prepossessing. In the sharply lined picture of him drawn by one

    of his Japanese comrades in the "Atlantic" for October, 1905,

    he appears, "slightly corpulent in later years, short in

    stature, hardly five feet high, of somewhat stooping gait. A

    little brownish in complexion, and of rather hairy skin. A

    thin, sharp, aquiline nose, large protruding eyes, of which the

    left was blind and the right very near-sighted."
The same writer, Nobushige Amenomori, has set down a

    reminiscence, not of Hearn the man, but of Hearn the genius,

    wherewith this introduction to the last of his writings may

    fitly conclude: "I shall ever retain the vivid remembrance of

    the sight I had when I stayed over night at his house for the

    first time. Being [pg xiv] used myself also to sit up

       late, I read in bed that night. The clock struck one in the

       morning, but there was a light in Hearn's study. I heard

       some low, hoarse coughing. I was afraid my friend might be

       ill; so I stepped out of my room and went to his study. Not

       wanting, however, to disturb him, if he was at work, I

       cautiously opened the door just a little, and peeped in. I

       saw my friend intent in writing at his high desk, with his

       nose almost touching the paper. Leaf after leaf he wrote on.

       In a while he held up his head, and what did I see! It was

       not the Hearn I was familiar with; it was another Hearn. His

       face was mysteriously white; his large eye gleamed. He

       appeared like one in touch with some unearthly presence.
"Within that homely looking man there burned something pure

    as the vestal fire, and in that flame dwelt a mind that called

    forth life and poetry out of dust, and grasped the highest

    themes of human thought."

THE ROMANCE, OF THE MILKY WAY

Of old it was said: 'The River of Heaven is the Ghost of

        Waters.' We behold it shifting its bed in the course of the

        year as an earthly river sometimes does.
Ancient Scholar
[pg 3]
Among the many charming festivals celebrated by Old Japan,

    the most romantic was the festival of Tanabata-Sama, the

    Weaving-Lady of the Milky Way. In the chief cities her holiday

    is now little observed; and in Tōkyō it is almost

    forgotten. But in many country districts, and even in villages,

    near the capital, it is still celebrated in a small way. If you

    happen to visit an old-fashioned country town or village, on

    the seventh day of the seventh month (by the ancient calendar),

    you will probably notice many freshly-cut bamboos fixed upon

    the roofs of the houses, or planted in the ground beside them,

    every bamboo having attached to it a number of strips of

    colored [pg 4] paper. In some very poor

       villages you might find that these papers are white, or of

       one color only; but the general rule is that the papers

       should be of five or seven different colors. Blue, green,

       red, yellow, and white are the tints commonly displayed. All

       these papers are inscribed with short poems written in

       praise of Tanabata and her husband Hikoboshi. After the

       festival the bamboos are taken down and thrown into the

       nearest stream, together with the poems attached to

       them.

To understand the romance of this old festival, you must

    know the legend of those astral divinities to whom offerings

    used to be made, even by, the Imperial Household, on the

    seventh day of the seventh month. The legend is Chinese. This

    is the Japanese popular version of it:—
The great god of the firmament had a lovely daughter,

    Tanabata-tsumé, who passed her days in weaving garments for her

    august parent. She rejoiced in her work, and thought that there

    was no greater pleasure than the

    [pg 5] pleasure of weaving. But one

       day, as she sat before her loom at the door of her heavenly

       dwelling, she saw a handsome peasant lad pass by, leading an

       ox, and she fell in love with him. Her august father,

       divining her secret wish, gave her the youth for a husband.

       But the wedded lovers became too fond of each other, and

       neglected their duty to the god of the firmament; the sound

       of the shuttle was no longer heard, and the ox wandered,

       unheeded, over the plains of heaven. Therefore the great god

       was displeased, and he separated the pair. They were

       sentenced to live thereafter apart, with the Celestial River

       between them; but it was permitted them to see each other

       once a year, on the seventh night of the seventh moon. On

       that night—providing the skies be clear—the

       birds of heaven make, with their bodies and wings, a bridge

       over the stream; and by means of that bridge the lovers can

       meet. But if there be rain, the River of Heaven rises, and

       becomes so wide that the bridge cannot be formed. So the

       husband and wife cannot always meet, even on the seventh

       night of the seventh [pg 6] month; it may happen, by reason

       of bad weather, that they cannot meet for three or four

       years at a time. But their love remains immortally young and

       eternally patient; and they continue to fulfill their

       respective duties each day without fault,—happy in

       their hope of being able to meet on the seventh night of the

       next seventh month.

To ancient Chinese fancy, the Milky Way was a luminous

    river,—the River of Heaven,—the Silver Stream. It

    has been stated by Western writers that Tanabata, the

    Weaving-Lady, is a star in Lyra; and the Herdsman, her beloved,

    a star in Aquila, on the opposite side of the galaxy. But it

    were more correct to say that both are represented, to

    Far-Eastern imagination, by groups of stars. An old Japanese

    book puts the matter thus plainly: "Kengyū (the Ox-Leader)

    is on the west side of the Heavenly River, and is represented

    by three stars in a row, and looks like a man leading an ox.

    Shokujo (the Weaving-Lady) is on the east side of the Heavenly

    River: three stars [pg 7] so placed as to appear like the

       figure of a woman seated at her loom.... The former presides

       over all things relating to agriculture; the latter, over

       all that relates to women's work."

In an old book called Zatsuwa-Shin, it is said that these

    deities were of earthly origin. Once in this world they were

    man and wife, and lived in China; and the husband was called

    Ishi, and the wife Hakuyō. They especially and most

    devoutly reverenced the Moon. Every clear evening, after

    sundown, they waited with eagerness to see her rise. And when

    she began to sink towards the horizon, they would climb to the

    top of a hill near their house, so that they might be able to

    gaze upon her face as long as possible. Then, when she at last

    disappeared from view, they would mourn together. At the age of

    ninety and nine, the wife died; and her spirit rode up to

    heaven on a magpie, and there became a star. The husband, who

    was then one hundred and three years old, sought consolation

    for his bereavement in looking at the Moon and when he welcomed

    her [pg 8] rising and mourned her setting,

       it seemed to him as if his wife were still beside him.
One summer night, Hakuyō—now immortally beautiful

    and young—descended from heaven upon her magpie, to visit

    her husband; and he was made very happy by that visit. But from

    that time he could think of nothing but the bliss of becoming a

    star, and joining Hakuyō beyond the River of Heaven. At

    last he also ascended to the sky, riding upon a crow; and there

    he became a star-god. But he could not join Hakuyō at

    once, as he had hoped;—for between his allotted place and

    hers flowed the River of Heaven; and it was not permitted for

    either star to cross the stream, because the Master of Heaven

    (Ten-Tei) daily bathed in its waters. Moreover, there

    was no bridge. But on one day every year—the seventh day

    of the seventh month—they were allowed to see each other.

    The Master of Heaven goes always on that day to the

    Zenhōdo, to hear the preaching of the law of Buddha; and

    then the magpies and the crows make, with their hovering bodies

    and outspread wings, a bridge over the

    [pg 9] Celestial Stream; and

       Hakuyō crosses that bridge to meet her husband.
There can be little doubt that the Japanese festival called

    Tanabata was originally identical with the festival of the

    Chinese Weaving-Goddess, Tchi-Niu; the Japanese holiday seems

    to have been especially a woman's holiday, from the earliest

    times; and the characters with which the word Tanabata is

    written signify a weaving-girl. But as both of the star-deities

    were worshiped on the seventh of the seventh month, some

    Japanese scholars have not been satisfied with the common

    explanation of the name, and have stated that it was originally

    composed with the word tané (seed, or grain), and the

    word hata (loom). Those who accept this etymology make

    the appellation, Tanabata-Sama, plural instead of singular, and

    render it as "the deities of grain and of the loom,"—that

    is to say, those presiding over agriculture and weaving. In old

    Japanese pictures the star-gods are represented according to

    this conception of their respective attributes;—Hikoboshi

    being figured as a peasant lad

    [pg 10] leading an ox to drink of the

       Heavenly River, on the farther side of which Orihimé

       (Tanabata) appears, weaving at her loom. The garb of both is

       Chinese; and the first Japanese pictures of these divinities

       were probably copied from some Chinese original.
In the oldest collection of Japanese poetry

    extant,—the Manyōshū, dating from 760

    A.D.,—the male divinity is usually called Hikoboshi, and

    the female Tanabata-tsumé; but in later times both have been

    called Tanabata. In Izumo the male deity is popularly termed

    O-Tanabata Sama, and the female Mé-Tanabata Sama. Both are

    still known by many names. The male is called Kaiboshi as well

    as Hikoboshi and Kengyū; while the female is called

    Asagao-himé ("Morning Glory Princess")1,

       Ito-ori-himé ("Thread-Weaving Princess"), Momoko-himé

       ("Peach-Child Princess"), Takimono-himé ("Incense

       Princess"), and Sasagani-himé ("Spider Princess"). Some of

       these names are difficult to explain,—especially

       [pg 11] the last, which reminds us of

       the Greek legend of Arachne. Probably the Greek myth and the

       Chinese story have nothing whatever in common; but in old

       Chinese books there is recorded a curious fact which might

       well suggest a relationship. In the time of the Chinese

       Emperor Ming Hwang (whom the Japanese call Gensō), it

       was customary for the ladies of the court, on the seventh

       day of the seventh month, to catch spiders and put them into

       an incense-box for purposes of divination. On the morning of

       the eighth day the box was opened; and if the spiders had

       spun thick webs during the night the omen was good. But if

       they had remained idle the omen was bad.

There is a story that, many ages ago, a beautiful woman

    visited the dwelling of a farmer in the mountains of Izumo, and

    taught to the only daughter of the household an art of weaving

    never before known. One evening the beautiful stranger vanished

    away; and the people knew that they had seen the Weaving-Lady

    of Heaven. The daughter of the farmer

    [pg 12] became renowned for her skill

       in weaving. But she would never marry,—because she had

       been the companion of Tanabata-Sama.

Then there is a Chinese story—delightfully

    vague—about a man who once made a visit, unawares, to the

    Heavenly Land. He had observed that every year, during the

    eighth month, a raft of precious wood came floating to the

    shore on which he lived; and he wanted to know where that wood

    grew. So he loaded a boat with provisions for a two years'

    voyage, and sailed away in the direction from which the rafts

    used to drift. For months and months he sailed on, over an

    always placid sea; and at last he arrived at a pleasant shore,

    where wonderful trees were growing. He moored his boat, and

    proceeded alone into the unknown land, until he came to the

    bank of a river whose waters were bright as silver. On the

    opposite shore he saw a pavilion; and in the pavilion a

    beautiful woman sat weaving; she was white like moonshine, and

    made a radiance all about her. Presently he saw a handsome

    young peasant [pg 13] approaching, leading an ox to

       the water; and he asked the young peasant to tell him the

       name of the place and the country. But the youth seemed to

       be displeased by the question, and answered in a severe

       tone: "If you want to know the name of this place, go back

       to where you came from, and ask

       Gen-Kum-Pei."2

       So the voyager, feeling afraid, hastened to his boat, and

       returned to China. There he sought out the sage Gen-Kum-Pei,

       to whom he related the adventure. Gen-Kum-Pei clapped his

       hands for wonder, and exclaimed, "So it was you!... On the

       seventh day of the seventh month I was gazing at the

       heavens, and I saw that the Herdsman and the Weaver were

       about to meet;—but between them was a new Star, which

       I took to be a Guest-Star. Fortunate man! you have been to

       the River of Heaven, and have looked upon the face of the

       Weaving-Lady!..."

—It is said that the meeting of the Herdsman and the

    Weaver can be observed by

    [pg 14] any one with good eyes; for

       whenever it occurs those stars burn with five different

       colors. That is why offerings of five colors are made to the

       Tanabata divinities, and why the poems composed in their

       praise are written upon paper of five different tints.
But, as I have said before, the pair can meet only in fair

    weather. If there be the least rain upon the seventh night, the

    River of Heaven will rise, and the lovers must wait another

    whole year. Therefore the rain that happens to fall on Tanabata

    night is called Namida no Amé, "The Rain of Tears."
When the sky is clear on the seventh night, the lovers are

    fortunate; and their stars can be seen to sparkle with delight.

    If the star Kengyū then shines very brightly, there will

    be great rice crops in the autumn. If the star Shokujo looks

    brighter than usual, there will be a prosperous time for

    weavers, and for every kind of female industry.

In old Japan it was generally supposed that the meeting of

    the pair signified [pg 15] good fortune to mortals. Even

       to-day, in many parts of the country, children sing a little

       song on the evening of the Tanabata festival,—Tenki

       ni nari! ("O weather, be clear!") In the province of Iga

       the young folks also sing a jesting song at the supposed

       hour of the lovers' meeting:—


Tanabata ya!
Amari isogaba,
Korobubéshi!3


But in the province of Izumo, which is a very rainy

    district, the contrary belief prevails; and it is thought that

    if the sky be clear on the seventh day of the seventh month,

    misfortune will follow. The local explanation of this belief is

    that if the stars can meet, there will be born from their union

    many evil deities who will afflict the country with drought and

    other calamities.

[pg 16]
The festival of Tanabata was first celebrated in Japan on

    the seventh day of the seventh month of Tombyō

    Shōhō (A.D. 755). Perhaps the Chinese origin of the

    Tanabata divinities accounts for the fact that their public

    worship was at no time represented by many temples.
I have been able to find record of only one temple to them,

    called Tanabata-jinja, which was situated at a village called

    Hoshiaimura, in the province of Owari, and surrounded by a

    grove called Tanabata-mori.4
Even before Tembyō Shōhō, however, the legend

    of the Weaving-Maiden seems to have been well known in Japan;

    for it is recorded that on the seventh night of the seventh

    year of Yōrō (A.D. 723) the poet Yamagami no Okura

    composed the song:—


Amanogawa,
Ai-muki tachité,
Waga

            koïshi[pg 17]
Kimi kimasu nari—
Himo-toki makina!5


It would seem that the Tanabata festival was first

    established in Japan eleven hundred and fifty years ago, as an

    Imperial Court festival only, in accordance with Chinese

    precedent. Subsequently the nobility and the military classes

    everywhere followed imperial example; and the custom of

    celebrating the Hoshi-mat-suri, or Star-Festival,—as it

    was popularly called,—spread gradually downwards, until

    at last the seventh day of the seventh month became, in the

    full sense of the term, a national holiday. But the fashion of

    its observance varied considerably at different eras and in

    different provinces.
The ceremonies at the Imperial Court were of the most

    elaborate character: a full account of them is given in the

    Kōji Kongen,—with explanatory illustrations.

    On the evening of the seventh day of the seventh month,

    mattings [pg 18] were laid down on the east

       side of that portion of the Imperial Palace called the

       Seir-yōden; and upon these mattings were placed four

       tables of offerings to the Star-deities. Besides the

       customary food-offerings, there were placed upon these

       tables rice-wine, incense, vases of red lacquer containing

       flowers, a harp and flute, and a needle with five eyes,

       threaded with threads of five different colors.

       Black-lacquered oil-lamps were placed beside the tables, to

       illuminate the feast. In another part of the grounds a tub

       of water was so placed as to reflect the light of the

       Tanabata-stars; and the ladies of the Imperial Household

       attempted to thread a needle by the reflection. She who

       succeeded was to be fortunate during the following year. The

       court-nobility (Kugé) were obliged to make certain

       offerings to the Imperial House on the day of the festival.

       The character of these offerings, and the manner of their

       presentation, were fixed by decree. They were conveyed to

       the palace upon a tray, by a veiled lady of rank, in

       ceremonial dress. Above her, as she walked, a great red

       umbrella was borne [pg 19] by an attendant. On the tray

       were placed seven tanzaku (longilateral slips of fine

       tinted paper for the writing of poems); seven

       kudzu-leaves;6

       seven inkstones; seven strings of sōmen (a kind

       of vermicelli); fourteen writing-brushes; and a bunch of

       yam-leaves gathered at night, and thickly sprinkled with

       dew. In the palace grounds the ceremony began at the Hour of

       the Tiger,—4 A.M. Then the inkstones were carefully

       washed,—prior to preparing the ink for the writing of

       poems in praise of the Star-deities,—and each one set

       upon a kudzu-leaf. One bunch of bedewed yam-leaves

       was then laid upon every inkstone; and with this dew,

       instead of water, the writing-ink was prepared. All the

       ceremonies appear to have been copied from those in vogue at

       the Chinese court in the time of the Emperor Ming-Hwang.

It was not until the time of the Tokugawa Shōgunate

    that the Tanabata festival became really a national holiday;

    and the popular custom of attaching tansaku of different

    colors [pg 20] to freshly-cut bamboos, in

       celebration of the occasion, dates only from the era of

       Bunser (1818). Previously the tanzaku had been made

       of a very costly quality of paper; and the old aristocratic

       ceremonies had been not less expensive than elaborate. But

       in the time of the Tokugawa Shōgunate a very cheap

       paper of various colors was manufactured; and the holiday

       ceremonies were suffered to assume an inexpensive form, in

       which even the poorest classes could indulge.
The popular customs relating to the festival differed

    according to locality. Those of Izumo—where all classes

    of society, samurai or common folk, celebrated the

    holiday in much the same way—used to be particularly

    interesting; and a brief account of them will suggest something

    of the happy aspects of life in feudal times. At the Hour of

    the Tiger, on the seventh night of the seventh month, everybody

    was up; and the work of washing the inkstones and

    writing-brushes was performed. Then, in the household garden,

    dew was collected upon yam-leaves. This dew was called

    Amanogawa no suzuki
[pg 21] ("drops from the River of

       Heaven"); and it was used to make fresh ink for writing the

       poems which were to be suspended to bamboos planted in the

       garden. It was usual for friends to present each other with

       new inkstones at the time of the Tanabata festival; and if

       there were any new inkstones in the house, the fresh ink was

       prepared in these. Each member of the family then wrote

       poems. The adults composed verses, according to their

       ability, in praise of the Star-deities; and the children

       either wrote dictation or tried to improvise. Little folk

       too young to use the writing-brush without help had their

       small hands guided, by parent or elder sister or elder

       brother, so as to shape on a tanzaku the character of

       some single word or phrase relating to the

       festival,—such as "Amanogawa," or "Tanabata," or

       "Kasasagi no Hashi" (the Bridge of Magpies). In the garden

       were planted two freshly-cut bamboos, with branches and

       leaves entire,—a male bamboo (otoko-daké) and a

       female bamboo (onna-daké). They were set up about six

       feet apart, and to a cord extended between them were

       suspended [pg 22] paper-cuttings of five

       colors, and skeins of dyed thread of five colors. The

       paper-cuttings represented upper-robes,—kimono.

       To the leaves and branches of the bamboos were tied the

       tanzaku on which poems had been written by the

       members of the family. And upon a table, set between the

       bamboos, or immediately before them, were placed vessels

       containing various offerings to the

       Star-deities,—fruits, sōmen, rice-wine,

       and vegetables of different kinds, such as cucumbers and

       watermelons.
But the most curious Izumo custom relating to the festival

    was the Nému-nagashi, or "Sleep-wash-away" ceremony.

    Before day-break the young folks used to go to some stream,

    carrying with them bunches composed of némuri-leaves and

    bean-leaves mixed together. On reaching the stream, they would

    fling their bunches of leaves into the current, and sing a

    little song:—


Nému wa, nagaré yo!
Mamé no ha wa, tomaré!


These verses might be rendered in two ways;

    [pg 23] because the word nému

       can be taken in the meaning either of némuri (sleep),

       or of nemuri-gi or némunoki, the "sleep-plant"

       (mimosa),—while the syllables mamé, as written

       in kana, can signify either "bean," or "activity," or

       "strength," "vigor," "health," etc. But the ceremony was

       symbolical, and the intended meaning of the song

       was:—


Drowsiness, drift away!
Leaves of vigor, remain!


After this, all the young folk would jump into the water, to

    bathe or swim, in token of their resolve to shed all laziness

    for the coming year, and to maintain a vigorous spirit of

    endeavor.

Yet it was probably in Yédo (now Tōkyō) that the

    Tanabata festival assumed its most picturesque aspects. During

    the two days that the celebration lasted,—the sixth and

    seventh of the seventh month,—the city used to present

    the appearance of one vast bamboo grove; fresh bamboos, with

    poems attached to them, being erected upon the roofs of the

    [pg 24] houses. Peasants were in

       those days able to do a great business in bamboos, which

       were brought into town by hundreds of wagonloads for holiday

       use. Another feature of the Yédo festival was the children's

       procession, in which bamboos, with poems attached to them,

       were carried about the city. To each such bamboo there was

       also fastened a red plaque on which were painted, in Chinese

       characters, the names of the Tanabata stars.
But almost everywhere, under the Tokugawa régime, the

    Tanabata festival used to be a merry holiday for the young

    people of all classes,—a holiday beginning with lantern

    displays before sunrise, and lasting well into the following

    night. Boys and girls on that day were dressed in their best,

    and paid visits of ceremony to friends and neighbors.

—The moon of the seventh month used to be called

    Tanabata-tsuki, or "The Moon of Tanabata." And it was

    also called Fumi-tsuki, or "The Literary Moon," because

    during the seventh month poems were everywhere

    [pg 25] composed in praise of the

       Celestial Lovers.

I think that my readers ought to be interested in the

    following selection of ancient Japanese poems, treating of the

    Tanabata legend. All are from the Manyōshū.

    The Manyōshū, or "Gathering of a Myriad

    Leaves," is a vast collection of poems composed before the

    middle of the eighth century. It was compiled by Imperial

    order, and completed early in the ninth century. The number of

    the poems which it contains is upwards of four thousand; some

    being "long poems" (naga-uta), but the great majority

    tanka, or compositions limited to thirty-one syllables;

    and the authors were courtiers or high officials. The first

    eleven tanka hereafter translated were composed by

    Yamagami no Okura, Governor of the province of Chikuzen more

    than eleven hundred years ago. His fame as a poet is well

    deserved; for not a little of his work will bear comparison

    with [pg 26] some of the finer epigrams of

       the Greek Anthology. The following verses, upon the death of

       his little son Furubi, will serve as an example:—


Wakakeréba
Nichi-yuki shiraji:
Mahi wa sému,
Shitabé no tsukahi
Ohité-tohorasé.


—[As he is so young, he cannot know the way....

        To the messenger of the Underworld I will give a bribe, and

        entreat him, saying: "Do thou kindly take the little one

        upon thy back along the road."]

Eight hundred years earlier, the Greek poet Diodorus Zonas

    of Sardis had written:—

"Do thou, who rowest the boat of the dead in the

        water of this reedy lake, for Hades, stretch out thy hand,

        dark Charon, to the son of Kinyras, as he mounts the ladder

        by the gang-way, and receive him. For his sandals will

        cause the lad to slip, and he fears to set his feet naked

        on the sand of the shore."
[pg 27]
But the charming epigram of Diodorus was inspired only by a

    myth,—for the "son of Kinyras" was no other than

    Adonis,—whereas the verses of Okura express for us the

    yearning of a father's heart.

—Though the legend of Tanabata was indeed borrowed

    from China, the reader will find nothing Chinese in the

    following compositions. They represent the old classic poetry

    at its purest, free from alien influence; and they offer us

    many suggestions as to the condition of Japanese life and

    thought twelve hundred years ago. Remembering that they were

    written before any modern European literature had yet taken

    form, one is startled to find how little the Japanese written

    language has changed in the course of so many centuries.

    Allowing for a few obsolete words, and sundry slight changes of

    pronunciation, the ordinary Japanese reader to-day can enjoy

    these early productions of his native muse with about as little

    difficulty as the English reader finds in studying the poets of

    the Elizabethan era. Moreover, the refinement and the

    [pg 28] simple charm of the

       Manyōshū compositions have never been

       surpassed, and seldom equaled, by later Japanese poets.
As for the forty-odd tanka which I have translated,

    their chief attraction lies, I think, in what they reveal to us

    of the human nature of their authors. Tanabata-tsumé still

    represents for us the Japanese wife, worshipfully

    loving;—Hikoboshi appears to us with none of the

    luminosity of the god, but as the young Japanese husband of the

    sixth or seventh century, before Chinese ethical convention had

    begun to exercise its restraint upon life and literature. Also

    these poems interest us by their expression of the early

    feeling for natural beauty. In them we find the scenery and the

    seasons of Japan transported to the Blue Plain of High

    Heaven;—the Celestial Stream with its rapids and

    shallows, its sudden risings and clamourings within its stony

    bed, and its water-grasses bending in the autumn wind, might

    well be the Kamogawa;—and the mists that haunt its shores

    are the very mists of Arashiyama. The boat of Hikoboshi,

    impelled by a single oar working upon a

    [pg 29] wooden peg, is not yet

       obsolete; and at many a country ferry you may still see the

       hiki-funé in which Tanabata-tsumé prayed her husband

       to cross in a night of storm,—a flat broad barge

       pulled over the river by cables. And maids and wives still

       sit at their doors in country villages, on pleasant autumn

       days, to weave as Tanabata-tsumé wove for the sake of her

       lord and lover.

—It will be observed that, in most of these verses, it

    is not the wife who dutifully crosses the Celestial River to

    meet her husband, but the husband who rows over the stream to

    meet the wife; and there is no reference to the Bridge of

    Birds.... As for my renderings, those readers who know by

    experience the difficulty of translating Japanese verse will be

    the most indulgent, I fancy. The Romaji system of spelling has

    been followed (except in one or two cases where I thought it

    better to indicate the ancient syllabication after the method

    adopted by Aston); and words or phrases necessarily supplied

    have been inclosed in

    parentheses.[pg 30]

—And yet it has been gravely asserted that the old

    Japanese poets could find no beauty in starry skies!...
Perhaps the legend of Tanabata, as it was understood by

    those old poets, can make but a faint appeal to Western minds.

    Nevertheless, in the silence of transparent nights, before the

    rising of the moon, the charm of the ancient tale sometimes

    descends upon me, out of the scintillant sky,—to make me

    forget the monstrous facts of science, and the stupendous

    horror of Space. Then I no longer behold the Milky Way as that

    awful Ring of the Cosmos,

    [pg 49] whose hundred million suns

       are powerless to lighten the Abyss, but as the very

       Amanogawa itself,—the River Celestial. I see the

       thrill of its shining stream, and the mists that hover along

       its verge, and the water-grasses that bend in the winds of

       autumn. White Orihimé I see at her starry loom, and the Ox

       that grazes on the farther shore;—and I know that the

       falling dew is the spray from the Herdsman's oar. And the

       heaven seems very near and warm and human; and the silence

       about me is filled with the dream of a love unchanging,

       immortal,—forever yearning and forever young, and

       forever left unsatisfied by the paternal wisdom of the

       gods.[pg 51]
GOBLIN POETRY[pg 53]
Recently, while groping about an old book shop, I found a

    collection of Goblin Poetry in three volumes, containing many

    pictures of goblins. The title of the collection is

    Kyōka Hyaku-Monogatari, or "The Mad Poetry of the

    Hyaku-Monogatari." The Hyaku-Monogatari, or

    "Hundred Tales," is a famous book of ghost stories. On the

    subject of each of the stories, poems were composed at

    different times by various persons,—poems of the sort

    called Kyōka, or Mad Poetry,—and these were

    collected and edited to form the three volumes of which I

    became the fortunate possessor. The collecting was done by a

    certain Takumi Jingorō, who wrote under the literary

    pseudonym [pg 54] "Temmér Réōjin" (Ancient

       of the Temmér Era). Takumi died in the first year of

       Bunkyū (1861), at the good age of eighty; and his

       collection seems to have been published in the sixth year of

       Kaéï (1853). The pictures were made by an artist called

       Masazumi, who worked under the pseudonym "Ryōsai

       Kanjin."
From a prefatory note it appears that Takumi Jingorō

    published his collection with the hope of reviving interest in

    a once popular kind of poetry which had fallen into neglect

    before the middle of the century. The word kyōka is

    written with a Chinese character signifying "insane" or

    "crazy;" and it means a particular and extraordinary variety of

    comic poetry. The form is that of the classic tanka of

    thirty-one syllables (arranged 57577);—but the subjects

    are always the extreme reverse of classical; and the artistic

    effects depend upon methods of verbal jugglery which cannot be

    explained without the help of numerous examples. The collection

    published by Takumi includes a good deal of matter in which a

    Western reader can discover no merit; but the

    [pg 55] best of it has a distinctly

       grotesque quality that reminds one of Hood's weird

       cleverness in playing with grim subjects. This quality, and

       the peculiar Japanese method of mingling the playful with

       the terrific, can be suggested and explained only by

       reproducing in Romaji the texts of various

       kyōka, with translations and notes.
The selection which I have made should prove interesting,

    not merely because it will introduce the reader to a class of

    Japanese poetry about which little or nothing has yet been

    written in English, but much more because it will afford some

    glimpses of a supernatural world which still remains for the

    most part unexplored. Without knowledge of Far Eastern

    superstitions and folk-tales, no real understanding of Japanese

    fiction or drama or poetry will ever become possible.

There are many hundreds of poems in the three volumes of the

    Kyōka Hyaku-Monogatari; but the number of the

    ghosts and goblins falls short of the one hundred suggested by

    [pg 56] the title. There are just

       ninety-five. I could not expect to interest my readers in

       the whole of this goblinry, and my selection includes less

       than one seventh of the subjects. The Faceless Babe, The

       Long-Tongued Maiden, The Three-Eyed Monk, The Pillow-Mover,

       The Thousand Heads, The Acolyte-with-the-Lantern, The

       Stone-that-Cries-in-the-Night, The Goblin-Heron, The

       Goblin-Wind, The Dragon-Lights, and The Mountain-Nurse, did

       not much impress me. I omitted kyōka dealing

       with fancies too gruesome for Western nerves,—such as

       that of the Obumédori,—also those treating of

       merely local tradition. The subjects chosen represent

       national rather than provincial folklore,—old beliefs

       (mostly of Chinese origin) once prevalent throughout the

       country, and often referred to in its popular

       literature.
I. KITSUNÉ-BI
The Will-o'-the-wisp is called kitsuné-bi

    ("fox-fire"), because the goblin-fox was formerly supposed to

    create it. In old Japanese

    [pg 57] pictures it is represented as

       a tongue of pale red flame, hovering in darkness, and

       shedding no radiance upon the surfaces over which it

       glides.
To understand some of the following kyōka on the

    subject, the reader should know that certain superstitions

    about the magical power of the fox have given rise to several

    queer folk-sayings,—one of which relates to marrying a

    stranger. Formerly a good citizen was expected to marry within

    his own community, not outside of it; and the man who dared to

    ignore traditional custom in this regard would have found it

    difficult to appease the communal indignation. Even to-day the

    villager who, after a long absence from his birthplace, returns

    with a strange bride, is likely to hear unpleasant things

    said,—such as: "Wakaranai-mono we hippaté-kita!...

    Doko no uma no honé da ka?" ("Goodness knows what kind of a

    thing he has dragged here after him! Where did he pick up that

    old horse-bone?") The expression uma no honé, "old

    horse-bone," requires

    explanation.[pg 58]
A goblin-fox has the power to assume many shapes; but, for

    the purpose of deceiving men, he usually takes the form

    of a pretty woman. When he wants to create a charming phantom

    of this kind, he picks up an old horse-bone or cow-bone, and

    holds it in his mouth. Presently the bone becomes luminous; and

    the figure of a woman defines about it,—the figure of a

    courtesan or singing-girl.... So the village query about the

    man who marries a strange wife, "What old horse-bone has he

    picked up?" signifies really, "What wanton has bewitched him?"

    It further implies the suspicion that the stranger may be of

    outcast blood: a certain class of women of pleasure having been

    chiefly recruited, from ancient time, among the daughters of

    Éta and other pariah-people.


Hi tomoshité
Kitsuné no kwaséshi,
Asobimé26

               wa—[pg 59]
Izuka no uma no
Honé ni ya aruran!


[—Ah the wanton (lighting her

        lantern)!—so a fox-fire is kindled in the time of

        fox-transformation!... Perhaps she is really nothing more

        than an old horse-bone from somewhere or other....]


Kitsuné-bi no
Moyuru ni tsukété,
Waga tama no
Kiyuru yō nari
Kokoro-hoso-michi!


[Because of that Fox-fire burning there, the very

        soul of me is like to be extinguished in this narrow path

        (or, in this heart-depressing

        solitude).27]
[pg 60]
II. RIKOMBYŌ
The term Rikombyō is composed with the word

    rikon, signifying a "shade," "ghost," or "spectre," and

    the word byō, signifying "sickness," "disease." An

    almost literal rendering would be "ghost-sickness." In

    Japanese-English dictionaries you will find the meaning of

    Rikombyō given as "hypochondria;" and doctors

    really use the term in this modern sense. But the ancient

    meaning was a disorder of the mind which produced a

    Double; and there is a whole strange literature about this

    weird disease. It used to be supposed, both in China and Japan,

    that under the influence of intense grief or longing, caused by

    love, the spirit of the suffering person would create a Double.

    Thus the victim of Rikombyō would appear to have

    two bodies, exactly alike; and one of these bodies would go to

    join the absent beloved, while the other remained at home. (In

    my "Exotics and Retrospectives," under the title "A Question in

    the Zen Texts," the reader will find a typical

    [pg 61] Chinese story on the

       subject,—the story of the girl Ts'ing.) Some form of

       the primitive belief in doubles and wraiths probably exists

       in every part of the world; but this Far Eastern variety is

       of peculiar interest because the double is supposed to be

       caused by love, and the subjects of the affliction to belong

       to the gentler sex.... The term Rikombyō seems

       to be applied to the apparition as well as to the mental

       disorder supposed to produce the apparition: it signifies

       "doppelgänger" as well as "ghost-disease."

—With these necessary explanations, the quality of the

    following kyōka can be understood. A picture which

    appears in the Kyōka Hyaku-Monogatari shows a

    maid-servant anxious to offer a cup of tea to her

    mistress,—a victim of the "ghost-sickness." The servant

    cannot distinguish between the original and the apparitional

    shapes before her; and the difficulties of the situation are

    suggested in the first of the kyōka which I have

    translated:—[pg 62]


Ko-ya, soré to?
Ayamé mo wakanu
Rikombyō:
Izuré we tsuma to
Hiku zo wazuraü!


[Which one is this?—which one is that? Between

        the two shapes of the Rikombyō it is not possible to

        distinguish. To find out which is the real wife—that

        will be an affliction of spirit indeed!]


Futatsu naki
Inochi nagara mo
Kakégaë no
Karada no miyuru—
Kage no wazurai!


[Two lives there certainly are

        not;—nevertheless an extra body is visible, by reason

        of the Shadow-Sickness.]


Naga-tabi no
Oto we shitaïté
Mi futatsu ni
Naru wa onna no
Sāru rikombyō.

[pg 63]

[Yearning after her far-journeying husband, the woman

        has thus become two bodies, by reason of her ghostly

        sickness.]


Miru kagé mo
Naki wazurai no
Rikombyō,—
Omoi no hoka ni
Futatsu miru kagé!


[Though (it was said that), because of her ghostly

        sickness, there was not even a shadow of her left to be

        seen,—yet, contrary to expectation, there are two

        shadows of her to be seen!28]


Rikombyō
Hito ni kakushité


            Oku-zashiki,[pg 64]
Omoté y dëasanu
Kagé no wazurai.


[Afflicted with the Rikombyō, she hides away

        from people in the back room, and never approaches the

        front of the house,—because of her

        Shadow-disease.29]


Mi wa koko ni;
Tama wa otoko ni
Soïné suru;—
Kokoro mo shiraga
Haha ga kaihō.


[Here her body lies; but her soul is far away, asleep

        in the arms of a man;—and the white-haired mother,

        little knowing her daughter's heart, is nursing (only the

        body).30]
[pg 65]


Tamakushigé
Futatsu no sugata

Awasé-kagami no
Kagé no wazurai.


[If, when seated before her toilet-stand, she sees

        two faces reflected in her mirror,—that might be

        caused by the mirror doubling itself under the influence of

        the Shadow-Sickness.31]

III. Ō-GAMA
In the old Chinese and Japanese literature the toad is

    credited with supernatural

    [pg 66] capacities,—such as the

       power to call down clouds, the power to make rain, the power

       to exhale from its mouth a magical mist which creates the

       most beautiful illusions. Some toads are good

       spirits,—friends of holy men; and in Japanese art a

       famous Rishi called "Gama-Sennin" (Toad Rishi) is usually

       represented with a white toad resting upon his shoulder, or

       squatting beside him. Some toads are evil goblins, and

       create phantasms for the purpose of luring men to

       destruction. A typical story about a creature of this class

       will be found in my "Kottō," entitled "The Story of

       Chugōrō."


Mé wa kagami,
Kuchi wa tarai no
Hodo ni aku:
Gama mo késhō no
Mono to kosō shiré.


[The eye of it, widely open, like a (round) mirror;

        the mouth of it opening like a wash-basin—by these

        things you may know that the Toad is a goblin-thing (or,

        that the Toad is a toilet

        article).32]
[pg 67]
IV. SHINKIRŌ
The term Shinkirō is used in the meaning of

    "mirage," and also as another name for Hōrai, the Elf-land

    of Far Eastern fable. Various beings in Japanese myth are

    credited with power to delude mortals by creating a mirage of

    Hōrai. In old pictures one may see a toad represented in

    the act of exhaling from its mouth a vapor that shapes the

    apparition of Hōrai.
But the creature especially wont to produce this illusion is

    the Hamaguri,—a Japanese mollusk much resembling a

    clam. Opening its shell, it sends into the air a purplish misty

    breath; and that mist takes form and defines, in tints of

    mother-of-pearl, the luminous vision of Hōrai and the

    palace of the Dragon-King.

        Maiden-Princess of the Dragon-Palace.]

[Lo! in the offing at ebb-tide, the hamaguri makes

        visible the miniature image of Shinkirō—the

        Dragon-Capital!]

V. ROKURO-KUBI
The etymological meaning of Rokuro-Kubi can scarcely

    be indicated by any English rendering. The term rokuro

    is indifferently used to designate many revolving

    objects—objects [pg 69] as dissimilar as a pulley, a

       capstan, a windlass, a turning lathe, and a potter's wheel.

       Such renderings of Rokuro-Kubi as "Whirling-Neck" and

       "Rotating-Neck" are unsatisfactory;—for the idea which

       the term suggests to Japanese fancy is that of a neck which

       revolves, and lengthens or retracts according to the

       direction of the revolution.... As for the ghostly

       meaning of the expression, a Rokuro-Kubi is either (1) a

       person whose neck lengthens prodigiously during sleep, so

       that the head can wander about in all directions, seeking

       what it may devour, or (2) a person able to detach his or

       her head completely from the body, and to rejoin it to the

       neck afterwards. (About this last mentioned variety of

       Rokuro-Kubi there is a curious story in my "Kwaidan,"

       translated from the Japanese.) In Chinese mythology the

       being whose neck is so constructed as to allow of the head

       being completely detached belongs to a special class; but in

       Japanese folk-tale this distinction is not always

       maintained. One of the bad habits attributed to the

       Rokuro-Kubi is that of drinking the oil in night-lamps. In

       [pg 70] Japanese pictures the

       Rokuro-Kubi is usually depicted as a woman; and old books

       tell us that a woman might become a Rokuro-Kubi without

       knowing it,—much as a somnambulist walks about while

       asleep, without being aware of the fact.... The following

       verses about the Rokuro-Kubi have been selected from a group

       of twenty in the Kyōka

       Hyaku-Monogatari:—


Nemidaré no
Nagaki kami woba
Furi-wakété,
Chi hiro ni nobasu
Rokuro-Kubi kana!


[Oh!... Shaking loose her long hair disheveled by

        sleep, the Rokuro-Kubi stretches her neck to the length of

        a thousand fathoms!]


"Atama naki
Bakémono nari"—to
Rokuro-Kubi,
Mité odorokan
Onoga karada we.


[Will not the Rokuro-Kubi, viewing with
[pg 71] astonishment her own

           body (left behind) cry out, "Oh, what a headless goblin

           have you become!"]


Tsuka-no-ma ni
Hari we tsutawaru,
Rokuro-Kubi
Kéta-kéta warau—
Kao no kowasa yo!


[Swiftly gliding along the roof-beam (and among the

        props of the roof), the Rokuro-Kubi laughs with the sound

        of "kéta-kéta"—oh! the fearfulness of her

        face!34]


Roku shaku no
Byōbu ni nobiru
Rokuro-Kubi
Mité wa, go shaku no
Mi wo chijimi-kéri!

[pg 72]

[Beholding the Rokuro-Kubi rise up above the six-foot

        screen, any five-foot person would have become shortened by

        fear (or, "the stature of any person five feet high would

        have been diminished").35]

VI. YUKI-ONNA
The Snow-Woman, or Snow-Spectre, assumes various forms; but

    in most of the old folk-tales she appears as a beautiful

    phantom, whose embrace is death. (A very curious story about

    her can be found in my "Kwaidan.")


Yuki-Onna—
Yosō kushi mo
Atsu kōri;
Sasu-kōgai ya
Kōri naruran.


[As for the Snow-Woman,—even her best comb, if

        I mistake not, is made of thick ice; and her

        hair-pin36,

           too, is probably made of ice.]
[pg 73]


Honrai wa
Kū naru mono ka,
Yuki-Onna?
Yoku-yoku mireba
Ichi-butsu mo nashi!


[Was she, then, a delusion from the very first, that

        Snow-Woman,—a thing that vanishes into empty space?

        When I look carefully all about me, not one trace of her is

        to be seen!]


Yo-akéréba
Kiété yuku é wa

[Having vanished at daybreak (that Snow-Woman), none

        could say whither she had gone. But what had seemed to be a

        snow-white woman became indeed a willow-tree!]
[pg 74]


Yuki-Onna
Mité wa yasathiku,
Matsu wo ori

[Though the Snow-Woman appears to sight slender and

        gentle, yet, to snap the pine-trees asunder and to crush

        the live bamboos, she must have had strength.]

Yanagi-goshi ka mo!


[Though the Snow-Woman makes one shiver by her

    coldness,—ah, the willowy grace of her form cannot be

    broken by the snow (i.e. charms us in spite of the

    cold).]
VII. FUNA-YŪRÉÏ
The spirits of the drowned are said to follow after ships,

    calling for a bucket or a water-dipper (hishaku). To

    refuse the bucket or the dipper is dangerous; but the bottom of

    the utensil should be knocked out before the request is

    complied with, and the spectres must not be allowed to see this

    operation performed. If an undamaged bucket or dipper be thrown

    to the ghosts, it will be used to fill and to sink the ship.

    These phantoms are commonly called Funa-Yūréï

    ("Ship-Ghosts").
The spirits of those warriors of the Héïké clan who perished

    in the great sea-fight at Dan-no-ura, in the year 1185, are

    famous among Funa-Yūréï. Taïra no Tomomori, one

    [pg 76] of the chiefs of the clan, is

       celebrated in this weird rôle: old pictures represent him,

       followed by the ghosts of his warriors, running over the

       waves to attack passing ships. Once he menaced a vessel in

       which Benkéï, the celebrated retainer of Yoshitsuné, was

       voyaging; and Benkéï was able to save the ship only by means

       of his Buddhist rosary, which frightened the spectres

       away....
Tomomori is frequently pictured as walking upon the sea,

    carrying a ship's anchor on his back. He and his fellow-ghosts

    are said to have been in the habit of uprooting and making off

    with the anchors of vessels imprudently moored in their

    particular domain,—the neighborhood of Shimonoséki.

[As if the nape of our necks had been sprinkled with

        cold water,—so we felt while listening
[pg 77] to the voice of the

           ship-ghost, saying:—"Lend me a

           dipper!"39]

[By the virtue of Benkéï's rosary, even

           ghost—even the apparition of Tomomori—is

           saved.]

[The ghosts following after our ship in their efforts

        to rise again (or, "to be saved") might perhaps be the

        (last vengeful) thoughts of drowned

[Having perished in the sea, (those Héïké) would

        the ship-following ghosts (appear), the wind has a smell of

        raw fish!46]

VIII. HÉÏKÉGANÍ
Readers can find in my "Kottō" a paper about the

    Héïké-Crabs, which have on their upper shells various

    wrinklings that resemble the outlines of an angry face. At

    Shimono-séki dried specimens of these curious creatures

    [pg 82] are offered for sale.... The

       Héïké-Crabs are said to be the transformed angry spirits of

       the Héïké warriors who perished at Dan-no-ura.


Shiwo-hi ni wa

        miserable world.47]

[All the (Héïké) party having been utterly crushed,

        claws have grown upon the breasts of the Héïké-crabs

        because of the resentment in their

        hearts.49]
[pg 84]
IX. YANARI
Modern dictionaries ignore the uncanny significations of the

    word Yanari,—only telling us that it means the

    sound of the shaking of a house during an earthquake. But the

    word used to mean the noise of the shaking of a house moved by

    a goblin; and the invisible shaker was also called

    Yanari. When, without apparent cause, some house would

    shudder and creak and groan in the night, folk used to suppose

    that it was being shaken from without by supernatural

    malevolence.

[Even the live tree set in the alcove has fallen

        down; and the mountains in the hanging picture tremble to

        the quaking made by the Yanari!50]

X. SAKASA-BASHIRA
The term Sakasa-bashira (in these kyōka

    often shortened into saka-bashira) literally means

    "upside-down post." A wooden post or pillar, especially a

    house-post, should be set up according to the original position

    of the tree from which it was hewn,—that is to say, with

    the part nearest to the roots downward. To erect a house-post

    in the contrary way is thought to be unlucky;—formerly

    such a blunder was believed to involve unpleasant consequences

    of a ghostly kind, because an "upside-down" pillar would do

    malignant things. It would moan and groan in the night, and

    move all its cracks [pg 86] like mouths, and open all its

       knots like eyes. Moreover, the spirit of it (for every

       house-post has a spirit) would detach its long body from the

       timber, and wander about the rooms, head-downwards, making

       faces at people. Nor was this all. A Sakasa-bashira

       knew how to make all the affairs of a household go

       wrong,—how to foment domestic quarrels,—how to

       contrive misfortune for each of the family and the

       servants,—how to render existence almost insupportable

       until such time as the carpenter's blunder should be

       discovered and remedied.

[That house-pillar hewn in the mountains of Hida, and

        thence brought here and erected upside-down—what

        carpenter's work can it be? (or, "for what evil design can

        this deed have been done?")]

Uri-iyé no

Oto arité:
Waré mé ga kuchi wo

[When I inquired for the master of the house that was

        for sale, there came to me only a strange sound by way of

        reply,—the sound of the upside-down house-post

        opening its eyes and mouth!54

           (i.e. its cracks).]
[pg 89]

[Who could have thought it!—even the poem

        inscribed upon the pillar-tablet, attached to the pillar

        which was planted upside-down, has taken the same (ghostly)

        sickness.55]

XI. BAKÉ-JIZÖ
The figure of the Bodhi-sattva Jizö, the savior of

    children's ghosts, is one of the most beautiful and humane in

    Japanese Buddhism. Statues of this divinity may be seen in

    almost every village and by every roadside. But some statues of

    Jizö are said to do uncanny

    [pg 90] things—such as to walk

       about at night in various disguises. A statue of this kind

       is called a Baké-Jizō56,—meaning

       a Jizō; that undergoes transformation. A conventional

       picture shows a little boy about to place the customary

       child's-offering of rice-cakes before the stone image of

       Jizō,—not suspecting that the statue moves, and

       is slowly bending down towards him.


Nanigé naki
Ishi no Jizō no
Sugata saë,
Yo wa osoroshiki
Mikagé to zo naki.


[Though the stone Jizō looks as if nothing were

        the matter with it, they say that at night it assumes an

        awful aspect (or, "Though this image appears to be a common

        stone Jizō, they say that at night it becomes an awful

        Jizō; of granite."57)]
[pg 91]
XII. UMI-BŌZU
Place a large cuttlefish on a table, body upwards and

    tentacles downwards—and you will have before you the

    grotesque reality that first suggested the fancy of the

    Umi-Bōzu, or Priest of the Sea. For the great bald

    body in this position, with the staring eyes below, bears a

    distorted resemblance to the shaven head of a priest; while the

    crawling tentacles underneath (which are in some species united

    by a dark web) suggests the wavering motion of the priest's

    upper robe.... The Umi-Bōzu figures a good deal in the

    literature of Japanese goblinry, and in the old-fashioned

    picture-books. He rises from the deep in foul weather to seize

    his prey.[pg 92]


Ita hitoë
Shita wa Jigoku ni,
Sumizomé no
Bōzu no umi ni
Déru mo ayashina!


[Since there is but the thickness of a single plank

        (between the voyager and the sea), and underneath is Hell,

        'tis indeed a weird thing that a black-robed priest should

        rise from the sea (or, "'tis surely a marvelous happening

        that," etc.!58)]

XIII. FUDA-HÉGASHI59
Homes are protected from evil spirits by holy texts and

    charms. In any Japanese [pg 93] village, or any city

       by-street, you can see these texts when the sliding-doors

       are closed at night: they are not visible by day, when the

       sliding-doors have been pushed back into the

       tobukuro. Such texts are called o-fuda (august

       scripts): they are written in Chinese characters upon strips

       of white paper, which are attached to the door with

       rice-paste; and there are many kinds of them. Some are texts

       selected from sutras—such as the Sûtra of Transcendent

       Wisdom (Pragña-Pâramitâ-Hridaya-Sûtra), or the Sûtra of the

       Lotos of the Good Law (Saddharma-Pundarikâ-Sûtra). Some are

       texts from the dhâranîs,—which are magical. Some are

       invocations only, indicating the Buddhist sect of the

       household.... Besides these you may see various smaller

       texts, or little prints, pasted above or beside windows or

       apertures,—some being names of Shinto gods; others,

       symbolical pictures only, or pictures of Buddhas and

       Bodhi-sattvas. All are holy charms,—o-fuda:

       they protect the houses; and no goblin or ghost can enter by

       night into a dwelling so protected, unless the o-fuda

       be removed.[pg 94]
Vengeful ghosts cannot themselves remove an o-fuda;

    but they will endeavor by threats or promises or bribes to make

    some person remove it for them. A ghost that wants to have the

    o-fuda pulled off a door is called a

    Fuda-hégashi.


Hégasan to
Rokuji-no-fuda wo,
Yuréï mo
Nam'mai dā to
Kazoëté zo mini.


[Even the ghost that would remove the charms written

        with six characters actually tries to count them,

        repeating: "How many sheets are there?" (or, repeating,

        "Hail to thee, O Buddha Amitábha!"60)]
[pg 95]


Tada ichi no
Kami no o-fuda wa
Sasuga ni mo
Noriké naku to mo
Hégashi kanékéri.


[Of the august written-charms of the god (which were

        pasted upon the walls of the house), not even one could by

        any effort be pulled off, though the rice-paste with which

        they had been fastened was all gone.]

XIV. FURU-TSUBAKI
The old Japanese, like the old Greeks, had their

    flower-spirits and their hamadryads, concerning whom some

    charming stories are told. They also believed in trees

    inhabited by malevolent beings,—goblin trees. Among other

    weird trees, the beautiful tsubaki (Camellia

    Japonica) was said to be an unlucky tree;—this was

    said, at least, of the red-flowering variety, the

    white-flowering kind having a better reputation and being

    prized as a rarity. The large fleshy crimson flowers have this

    curious habit: they detach themselves bodily from the

    [pg 96] stem, when they begin to

       fade; and they fall with an audible thud. To old Japanese

       fancy the falling of these heavy red flowers was like the

       falling of human heads under the sword; and the dull sound

       of their dropping was said to be like the thud made by a

       severed head striking the ground. Nevertheless the tsubaki

       seems to have been a favorite in Japanese gardens because of

       the beauty of its glossy foliage; and its flowers were used

       for the decoration of alcoves. But in samurai homes it was a

       rule never to place tsubaki-flowers in an alcove during

       war-time.
The reader will notice that in the following

    kyōka—which, as grotesques, seem to me the

    best in the collection—the goblin-tsubaki is called

    furu-tsubaki, "old tsubaki." The young tree was not

    supposed to have goblin-propensities,—these being

    developed only after many years. Other uncanny trees—such

    as the willow and the énoki—were likewise said to

    become dangerous only as they became old; and a similar belief

    prevailed on the subject of uncanny animals, such as the

    cat—innocent in kittenhood, but devilish in

    age.[pg 97]

[pg 99]
—Nearly all the stories and folk-beliefs about which

    these kyōka were written seem to have come from

    China; and most of the Japanese tales of tree-spirits appear to

    have had a Chinese origin. As the flower-spirits and hamadryads

    of the Far East are as yet little known to Western readers, the

    following Chinese story may be found interesting.

There was a Chinese scholar—called, in Japanese books,

    Tō no Busanshi—who was famous for his love of

    flowers. He was particularly fond of peonies, and cultivated

    them with great skill and patience.64
One day a very comely girl came to the house of Busanshi,

    and begged to be taken into his service. She said that

    circumstances obliged her to seek humble employment, but that

    she had received a literary education, and

    [pg 100] therefore wished to enter,

       if possible, into the service of a scholar. Busanshi was

       charmed by her beauty, and took her into his household

       without further questioning. She proved to be much more than

       a good domestic: indeed, the nature of her accomplishments

       made Busanshi suspect that she had been brought up in the

       court of some prince, or in the palace of some great lord.

       She displayed a perfect knowledge of the etiquette and the

       polite arts which are taught only to ladies of the highest

       rank; and she possessed astonishing skill in calligraphy, in

       painting, and in every kind of poetical composition.

       Busanshi presently fell in love with her, and thought only

       of how to please her. When scholar-friends or other visitors

       of importance came to the house, he would send for the new

       maid that she might entertain and wait upon his guests; and

       all who saw her were amazed by her grace and charm.
One day Busanshi received a visit from the great

    Teki-Shin-Ketsu, a famous teacher of moral doctrine; and the

    maid did not respond to her master's call. Busanshi went

    [pg 101] himself to seek her, being

       desirous that Teki-Shin-Ketsu should see her and admire her;

       but she was nowhere to be found. After having searched the

       whole house in vain, Busanshi was returning to the

       guest-room when he suddenly caught sight of the maid,

       gliding soundlessly before him along a corridor. He called

       to her, and hurried after her. Then she turned half-round,

       and flattened herself against the wall like a spider; and as

       he reached her she sank backwards into the wall, so that

       there remained of her nothing visible but a colored

       shadow,—level like a picture painted on the plaster.

       But the shadow moved its lips and eyes, and spoke to him in

       a whisper, saying:—
"Pardon me that I did not obey your august call!... I am not

    a mankind-person;—I am only the Soul of a Peony. Because

    you loved peonies so much, I was able to take human shape, and

    to serve you. But now this Teki-Shin-Ketsu has come,—and

    he is a person of dreadful propriety,—and I dare not keep

    this form any longer.... I must return to the place from which

    I came."[pg 102]
Then she sank back into the wall, and vanished altogether:

    there was nothing where she had been except the naked plaster.

    And Busanshi never saw her again.
This story is written in a Chinese book which the Japanese

    call "Kai-ten-i-ji."[pg 103]
"ULTIMATE

    QUESTIONS"[pg 105]
A memory of long ago.... I am walking upon a granite

    pavement that rings like iron, between buildings of granite

    bathed in the light of a cloudless noon. Shadows are short and

    sharp: there is no stir in the hot bright air; and the sound of

    my footsteps, strangely loud, is the only sound in the

    street.... Suddenly an odd feeling comes to me, with a sort of

    tingling shock,—a feeling, or suspicion, of universal

    illusion. The pavement, the bulks of hewn stone, the iron

    rails, and all things visible, are dreams! Light, color, form,

    weight, solidity—all sensed existences—are but

    phantoms of being, manifestations only of one infinite

    ghostliness for which the language of man has not any

    word....[pg 106]
This experience had been produced by study of the first

    volume of the Synthetic Philosophy, which an American friend

    had taught me how to read. I did not find it easy reading;

    partly because I am a slow thinker, but chiefly because my mind

    had never been trained to sustained effort in such directions.

    To learn the "First Principles" occupied me many months: no

    other volume of the series gave me equal trouble. I would read

    one section at a time,—rarely two,—never venturing

    upon a fresh section until I thought that I had made sure of

    the preceding. Very cautious and slow my progress was, like

    that of a man mounting, for the first time, a long series of

    ladders in darkness. Reaching the light at last, I caught a

    sudden new vision of things,—a momentary perception of

    the illusion of surfaces,—and from that time the world

    never again appeared to me quite the same as it had appeared

    before.

—This memory of more than twenty years ago, and the

    extraordinary thrill of the moment, were recently revived for

    me by the [pg 107] reading of the essay

       "Ultimate Questions," in the last and not least precious

       volume bequeathed us by the world's greatest thinker. The

       essay contains his final utterance about the riddle of life

       and death, as that riddle presented itself to his vast mind

       in the dusk of a lifetime of intellectual toil. Certainly

       the substance of what he had to tell us might have been

       inferred from the Synthetic Philosophy; but the particular

       interest of this last essay is made by the writer's

       expression of personal sentiment regarding the problem that

       troubles all deep thinkers. Perhaps few of us could have

       remained satisfied with his purely scientific position. Even

       while fully accepting his declaration of the identity of the

       power that "wells up in us under the form of consciousness"

       with that Power Unknowable which shapes all things, most

       disciples of the master must have longed for some chance to

       ask him directly, "But how do you feel in regard to

       the prospect of personal dissolution?" And this merely

       emotional question he has answered as frankly and as fully

       as any of us could have desired,—perhaps

       [pg 108] even more frankly. "Old

       people," he remarks apologetically, "must have many

       reflections in common. Doubtless one which I have now in

       mind is very familiar. For years past, when watching the

       unfolding buds in the spring, there has arisen the thought,

       'Shall I ever again see the buds unfold? Shall I ever again

       be awakened at dawn by the song of the thrush?' Now that the

       end is not likely to be long postponed, there results an

       increasing tendency to meditate upon ultimate questions."...

       Then he tells us that these ultimate questions—"of the

       How and the Why, of the Whence and the Whither"—occupy

       much more space in the minds of those who cannot accept the

       creed of Christendom, than the current conception fills in

       the minds of the majority of men. The enormity of the

       problem of existence becomes manifest only to those who have

       permitted themselves to think freely and widely and deeply,

       with all such aids to thought as exact science can furnish;

       and the larger the knowledge of the thinker, the more

       pressing and tremendous the problem appears, and

       [pg 109] the more hopelessly

       unanswerable. To Herbert Spencer himself it must have

       assumed a vastness beyond the apprehension of the average

       mind; and it weighed upon him more and more inexorably the

       nearer he approached to death. He could not avoid the

       conviction—plainly suggested in his magnificent

       Psychology and in other volumes of his great work—that

       there exists no rational evidence for any belief in the

       continuance of conscious personality after death:—

"After studying primitive beliefs, and finding that

        there is no origin for the idea of an after-life, save the

        conclusion which the savage draws, from the notion

        suggested by dreams, of a wandering double which comes back

        on awaking, and which goes away for an indefinite time at

        death;—and after contemplating the inscrutable

        relation between brain and consciousness, and finding that

        we can get no evidence of the existence of the last without

        the activity of the first,—we seem obliged to

        relinquish the thought that consciousness continues after

        physical organization has become inactive."
[pg 110]
In this measured utterance there is no word of hope; but

    there is at least a carefully stated doubt, which those who

    will may try to develop into the germ of a hope. The guarded

    phrase, "we seem obliged to relinquish," certainly

    suggests that, although in the present state of human knowledge

    we have no reason to believe in the perpetuity of

    consciousness, some larger future knowledge might help us to a

    less forlorn prospect. From the prospect as it now appears even

    this mightiest of thinkers recoiled:—

... "But it seems a strange and repugnant conclusion

        that with the cessation of consciousness at death there

        ceases to be any knowledge of having existed. With his last

        breath it becomes to each the same thing as though he had

        never lived.
"And then the consciousness itself—what is it

        during the time that it continues? And what becomes of it

        when it ends? We can only infer that it is a specialized

        and individualized form of that Infinite and Eternal Energy

        which transcends both our knowledge and our imagination;

        [pg 111] and that at death its

           elements lapse into that Infinite and Eternal Energy

           whence they were derived."


—With his last breath it becomes to each the same

    thing as though he had never lived? To the individual,

    perhaps—surely not to the humanity made wiser and better

    by his labors.... But the world must pass away: will it

    thereafter be the same for the universe as if humanity had

    never existed? That might depend upon the possibilities of

    future inter-planetary communication.... But the whole universe

    of suns and planets must also perish: thereafter will it be the

    same as if no intelligent life had ever toiled and suffered

    upon those countless worlds? We have at least the certainty

    that the energies of life cannot be destroyed, and the strong

    probability that they will help to form another life and

    thought in universes yet to be evolved.... Nevertheless,

    allowing for all imagined possibilities,—granting even

    the likelihood of some inapprehensible relation between all

    past and all future [pg 112]

       conditioned-being,—the tremendous question remains:

       What signifies the whole of apparitional existence to the

       Unconditioned? As flickers of sheet-lightning leave no

       record in the night, so in that Darkness a million billion

       trillion universes might come and go, and leave no trace of

       their having been.

To every aspect of the problem Herbert Spencer must have

    given thought; but he has plainly declared that the human

    intellect, as at present constituted, can offer no solution.

    The greatest mind that this world has yet produced—the

    mind that systematized all human knowledge, that revolutionized

    modern science, that dissipated materialism forever, that

    revealed to us the ghostly unity of all existence, that

    reestablished all ethics upon an immutable and eternal

    foundation,—the mind that could expound with equal

    lucidity, and by the same universal formula, the history of a

    gnat or the history of a sun—confessed itself, before the

    Riddle of Existence, scarcely less helpless than the mind of a

    child.[pg 113]
But for me the supreme value of this last essay is made by

    the fact that in its pathetic statement of uncertainties and

    probabilities one can discern something very much resembling a

    declaration of faith. Though assured that we have yet no

    foundation for any belief in the persistence of consciousness

    after the death of the brain, we are bidden to remember that

    the ultimate nature of consciousness remains inscrutable.

    Though we cannot surmise the relation of consciousness to the

    unseen, we are reminded that it must be considered as a

    manifestation of the Infinite Energy, and that its elements, if

    dissociated by death, will return to the timeless and

    measureless Source of Life.... Science to-day also assures us

    that whatever existence has been—all individual life that

    ever moved in animal or plant,—all feeling and thought

    that ever stirred in human consciousness—must have

    flashed self-record beyond the sphere of sentiency; and though

    we cannot know, we cannot help imagining that the best of such

    registration may be destined to perpetuity. On this latter

    subject, for [pg 114] obvious reasons, Herbert

       Spencer has remained silent; but the reader may ponder a

       remarkable paragraph in the final sixth edition of the

       "First Principles,"—a paragraph dealing with the

       hypothesis that consciousness may belong to the cosmic

       ether. This hypothesis has not been lightly dismissed by

       him; and even while proving its inadequacy, he seems to

       intimate that it may represent imperfectly some truth yet

       inapprehensible by the human mind:—

"The only supposition having consistency is that that in

        which consciousness inheres is the all-pervading ether.

        This we know can be affected by molecules of matter in

        motion, and conversely can affect the motions of

        molecules;—as witness the action of light on the

        retina. In pursuance of this supposition we may assume that

        the ether, which pervades not only all space but all

        matter, is, under special conditions in certain parts of

        the nervous system, capable of being affected by the

        nervous changes in such way as to result in feeling, and is

        reciprocally capable under these conditions of affecting

        the nervous changes. But if we accept this explanation, we

        must assume that the potentiality

        [pg 115] of feeling is

           universal, and that the evolution of feeling in the

           ether takes place only under the extremely complex

           conditions occurring in certain nervous centres. This,

           however, is but a semblance of an explanation, since we

           know not what the ether is, and since, by confession of

           those most capable of judging, no hypothesis that has

           been framed accounts for all its powers. Such an

           explanation may be said to do no more than symbolize the

           phenomena by symbols of unknown natures."—["First

           Principles," § 71 c, definitive edition of

           1900.]
—"Inscrutable is this complex consciousness which

        has slowly evolved out of infantine

        vacuity—consciousness which, in other shapes, is

        manifested by animate beings at large—consciousness

        which, during the development of every creature, makes its

        appearance out of what seems unconscious matter;

        suggesting the thought that consciousness, in some

        rudimentary form, is omnipresent."65

—Of all modern thinkers, Spencer was perhaps the most

    careful to avoid giving encouragement to any hypothesis

    unsupported [pg 116] by powerful evidence. Even

       the simple sum of his own creed is uttered only, with due

       reservation, as a statement of three probabilities: that

       consciousness represents a specialized and individualized

       form of the infinite Energy; that it is dissolved by death;

       and that its elements then return to the source of all

       being. As for our mental attitude toward the infinite

       Mystery, his advice is plain. We must resign ourselves to

       the eternal law, and endeavor to vanquish our ancient

       inheritance of superstitious terrors, remembering that,

       "merciless as is the Cosmic process worked out by an Unknown

       Power, yet vengeance is nowhere to be found in

       it."66

In the same brief essay there is another confession of

    singular interest,—an acknowledgment of the terror of

    Space. To even the ordinary mind, the notion of infinite

    [pg 117] Space, as forced upon us by

       those monstrous facts of astronomy which require no serious

       study to apprehend, is terrifying;—I mean the mere

       vague idea of that everlasting Night into which the blazing

       of millions of suns can bring neither light nor warmth. But

       to the intellect of Herbert Spencer the idea of Space must

       have presented itself after a manner incomparably more

       mysterious and stupendous. The mathematician alone will

       comprehend the full significance of the paragraph dealing

       with the Geometry of Position and the mystery of

       space-relations,—or the startling declaration that

       "even could we penetrate the mysteries of existence, there

       would remain still more transcendent mysteries." But Herbert

       Spencer tells us that, apart from the conception of these

       geometrical mysteries, the problem of naked Space itself

       became for him, in the twilight of his age, an obsession and

       a dismay:—

... "And then comes the thought of this universal matrix

        itself, anteceding alike creation or evolution, whichever

        be assumed, and infinitely

        [pg 118] transcending both,

           alike in extent and duration; since both, if conceived

           at all, must be conceived as having had beginnings,

           while Space had no beginning. The thought of this blank

           form of existence which, explored in all directions as

           far as imagination can reach, has, beyond that, an

           unexplored region compared with which the part which

           imagination has traversed is but

           infinitesimal,—the thought of a Space compared

           with which our immeasurable sidereal system dwindles to

           a point is a thought too overwhelming to be dwelt upon.

           Of late years the consciousness that without origin or

           cause infinite Space has ever existed and must ever

           exist, produces in me a feeling from which I

           shrink."


How the idea of infinite Space may affect a mind

    incomparably more powerful than my own, I cannot

    know;—neither can I divine the nature of certain problems

    which the laws of space-relation present to the geometrician.

    But when I try to determine the cause of the horror which that

    idea evokes within my own feeble imagination, I am able to

    distinguish different elements of the emotion,—particular

    [pg 119] forms of terror responding

       to particular ideas (rational and irrational) suggested by

       the revelations of science. One feeling—perhaps the

       main element of the horror—is made by the thought of

       being prisoned forever and ever within that

       unutterable Viewlessness which occupies infinite Space.
Behind this feeling there is more than the thought of

    eternal circumscription;—there is also the idea of being

    perpetually penetrated, traversed, thrilled by the

    Nameless;—there is likewise the certainty that no least

    particle of innermost secret Self could shun the eternal touch

    of It;—there is furthermore the tremendous conviction

    that could the Self of me rush with the swiftness of

    light,—with more than the swiftness of

    light,—beyond all galaxies, beyond durations of time so

    vast that Science knows no sign by which their magnitudes might

    be indicated,—and still flee onward, onward, downward,

    upward,—always, always,—never could that Self of me

    reach nearer to any verge, never speed farther from any centre.

    For, in that Silence, all vastitude

    [pg 120] and height and depth and

       time and direction are swallowed up: relation therein could

       have no meaning but for the speck of my fleeting

       consciousness,—atom of terror pulsating alone through

       atomless, soundless, nameless, illimitable potentiality.
And the idea of that potentiality awakens another quality of

    horror,—the horror of infinite Possibility. For this

    Inscrutable that pulses through substance as if substance were

    not at all,—so subtly that none can feel the flowing of

    its tides, yet so swiftly that no life-time would suffice to

    count the number of the oscillations which it makes within the

    fraction of one second,—thrills to us out of

    endlessness;—and the force of infinity dwells in its

    lightest tremor; the weight of eternity presses behind its

    faintest shudder. To that phantom-Touch, the tinting of a

    blossom or the dissipation of a universe were equally facile:

    here it caresses the eye with the charm and illusion of color;

    there it bestirs into being a cluster of giant suns. All that

    human mind is capable of conceiving as possible (and how much

    [pg 121] also that human mind must

       forever remain incapable of conceiving?) may be wrought

       anywhere, everywhere, by a single tremor of that

       Abyss....

Is it true, as some would have us believe, that the fear of

    the extinction of self is the terror supreme?... For the

    thought of personal perpetuity in the infinite vortex is enough

    to evoke sudden trepidations that no tongue can

    utter,—fugitive instants of a horror too vast to enter

    wholly into consciousness: a horror that can be endured in

    swift black glimpsings only. And the trust that we are one with

    the Absolute—dim points of thrilling in the abyss of

    It—can prove a consoling faith only to those who find

    themselves obliged to think that consciousness dissolves with

    the crumbling of the brain.... It seems to me that few (or

    none) dare to utter frankly those stupendous doubts and fears

    which force mortal intelligence to recoil upon itself at every

    fresh attempt to pass the barrier of the Knowable. Were that

    barrier unexpectedly pushed

    [pg 122] back,—were knowledge

       to be suddenly and vastly expanded beyond its present

       limits,—perhaps we should find ourselves unable to

       endure the revelation....

Mr. Percival Lowell's astonishing book, "Mars," sets one to

    thinking about the results of being able to hold communication

    with the habitants of an older and a wiser world,—some

    race of beings more highly evolved than we, both intellectually

    and morally, and able to interpret a thousand mysteries that

    still baffle our science. Perhaps, in such event, we should not

    find ourselves able to comprehend the methods, even could we

    borrow the results, of wisdom older than all our civilization

    by myriads or hundreds of myriads of years. But would not the

    sudden advent of larger knowledge from some elder planet prove

    for us, by reason, of the present moral condition of mankind,

    nothing less than a catastrophe?—might it not even result

    in the extinction of the human species?...
The rule seems to be that the dissemination of dangerous

    higher knowledge, before

    [pg 123] the masses of a people are

       ethically prepared to receive it, will always be prevented

       by the conservative instinct; and we have reason to suppose

       (allowing for individual exceptions) that the power to gain

       higher knowledge is developed only as the moral ability to

       profit by such knowledge is evolved. I fancy that if the

       power of holding intellectual converse with other worlds

       could now serve us, we should presently obtain it. But if,

       by some astonishing chance,—as by the discovery, let

       us suppose, of some method of ether-telegraphy,—this

       power were prematurely acquired, its exercise would in all

       probability be prohibited.... Imagine, for example, what

       would have happened during the Middle Ages to the person

       guilty of discovering means to communicate with the people

       of a neighboring planet! Assuredly that inventor and his

       apparatus and his records would have been burned; every

       trace and memory of his labors would have been extirpated.

       Even to-day the sudden discovery of truths unsupported by

       human experience, the sudden revelation of facts totally

       opposed to [pg 124] existing convictions, might

       evoke some frantic revival of superstitious

       terrors,—some religious panic-fury that would strangle

       science, and replunge the world in mental darkness for a

       thousand years.[pg 125]
THE MIRROR

    MAIDEN[pg 127]
In the period of the Ashikaga Shōgunate the shrine of

    Ogawachi-Myōjin, at Minami-Isé, fell into decay; and the

    daimyō of the district, the Lord Kitahataké, found himself

    unable, by reason of war and other circumstances, to provide

    for the reparation of the building. Then the Shintō priest

    in charge, Matsumura Hyōgo, sought help at Kyōto from

    the great daimyō Hosokawa, who was known to have influence

    with the Shōgun. The Lord Hosokawa received the priest

    kindly, and promised to speak to the Shōgun about the

    condition of Ogawachi-Myōjin. But he said that, in any

    event, a grant for the restoration of the temple could not be

    made without due investigation and considerable

    [pg 128] delay; and he advised

       Matsumura to remain in the capital while the matter was

       being arranged. Matsumura therefore brought his family to

       Kyōto, and rented a house in the old Kyōgoku

       quarter.
This house, although handsome and spacious, had been long

    unoccupied. It was said to be an unlucky house. On the

    northeast side of it there was a well; and several former

    tenants had drowned themselves in that well, without any known

    cause. But Matsumura, being a Shintō priest, had no fear

    of evil spirits; and he soon made himself very comfortable in

    his new home.

In the summer of that year there was a great drought. For

    months no rain had fallen in the Five Home-Provinces; the

    river-beds dried up, the wells failed; and even in the capital

    there was a dearth of water. But the well in Matsumura's garden

    remained nearly full; and the water—which was very cold

    and clear, with a faint bluish tinge—seemed to be

    supplied by a spring. During the hot season many

    [pg 129] people came from all parts

       of the city to beg for water; and Matsumura allowed them to

       draw as much as they pleased. Nevertheless the supply did

       not appear to be diminished.
But one morning the dead body of a young servant, who had

    been sent from a neighboring residence to fetch water, was

    found floating in the well. No cause for a suicide could be

    imagined; and Matsumura, remembering many unpleasant stories

    about the well, began to suspect some invisible malevolence. He

    went to examine the well, with the intention of having a fence

    built around it; and while standing there alone he was startled

    by a sudden motion in the water, as of something alive. The

    motion soon ceased; and then he perceived, clearly reflected in

    the still surface, the figure of a young woman, apparently

    about nineteen or twenty years of age. She seemed to be

    occupied with her toilet: he distinctly saw her touching her

    lips with béni67

       At first her face was visible in profile only; but presently

       she turned towards him and smiled. Immediately he felt a

       strange shock [pg 130] at his heart, and a

       dizziness came upon him like the dizziness of wine, and

       everything became dark, except that smiling

       face,—white and beautiful as moonlight, and always

       seeming to grow more beautiful, and to be drawing him

       down—down—down into the darkness. But with a

       desperate effort he recovered his will and closed his eyes.

       When he opened them again, the face was gone, and the light

       had returned; and he found himself leaning down over the

       curb of the well. A moment more of that dizziness,—a

       moment more of that dazzling lure,—and he would never

       again have looked upon the sun...
Returning to the house, he gave orders to his people not to

    approach the well under any circumstances, or allow any person

    to draw water from it. And the next day he had a strong fence

    built round the well.

About a week after the fence had been built, the long

    drought was broken by a great rain-storm, accompanied by wind

    and lightning and thunder,—thunder so tremendous

    [pg 131] that the whole city shook

       to the rolling of it, as if shaken by an earthquake. For

       three days and three nights the downpour and the lightnings

       and the thunder continued; and the Kamogawa rose as it had

       never risen before, carrying away many bridges. During the

       third night of the storm, at the Hour of the Ox, there was

       heard a knocking at the door of the priest's dwelling, and

       the voice of a woman pleading for admittance. But Matsumura,

       warned by his experience at the well, forbade his servants

       to answer the appeal. He went himself to the entrance, and

       asked,—
"Who calls?"
A feminine voice responded:—
"Pardon! it is I,—Yayoi!68...

       I have something to say to Matsumura Sama,—something

       of great moment. Please open!"...
Matsumura half opened the door, very cautiously; and he saw

    the same beautiful face that had smiled upon him from the well.

    But it was not smiling now: it had a very sad look.
"Into my house you shall not come,"

    [pg 132] the priest exclaimed. "You

       are not a human being, but a Well-Person.... Why do you thus

       wickedly try to delude and destroy people?"
The Well-Person made answer in a voice musical as a tinkling

    of jewels (tama-wo-korogasu-koë.):—
"It is of that very matter that I want to speak.... I have

    never wished to injure human beings. But from ancient time a

    Poison-Dragon dwelt in that well. He was the Master of the

    Well; and because of him the well was always full. Long ago I

    fell into the water there, and so became subject to him; and he

    had power to make me lure people to death, in order that he

    might drink their blood. But now the Heavenly Ruler has

    commanded the Dragon to dwell hereafter in the lake called

    Torii-no-Iké, in the Province of Shinshū; and the gods

    have decided that he shall never be allowed to return to this

    city. So to-night, after he had gone away, I was able to come

    out, to beg for your kindly help. There is now very little

    water in the well, because of the

    [pg 133] Dragon's departure; and if

       you will order search to be made, my body will be found

       there. I pray you to save my body from the well without

       delay; and I shall certainly return your

       benevolence."...
So saying, she vanished into the night.

Before dawn the tempest had passed; and when the sun arose

    there was no trace of cloud in the pure blue sky. Matsumura

    sent at an early hour for well-cleaners to search the well.

    Then, to everybody's surprise, the well proved to be almost

    dry. It was easily cleaned; and at the bottom of it were found

    some hair-ornaments of a very ancient fashion, and a metal

    mirror of curious form—but no trace of any body, animal

    or human.
Matusmura imagined, however, that the mirror might yield

    some explanation of the mystery; for every such mirror is a

    weird thing, having a soul of its own,—and the soul of a

    mirror is feminine. This mirror, which seemed to be very old,

    was deeply crusted with scurf. But when it had been carefully

    cleaned, [pg 134] by the priest's order, it

       proved to be of rare and costly workmanship; and there were

       wonderful designs upon the back of it,—also several

       characters. Some of the characters had become

       indistinguishable; but there could still be discerned part

       of a date, and ideographs signifying, "third month, the

       third day." Now the third month used to be termed

       Yayoi (meaning, the Month of Increase); and the third

       day of the third month, which is a festival day, is still

       called Yayoi-no-sekku. Remembering that the

       Well-Person called herself "Yayoi," Matsumura felt almost

       sure that his ghostly visitant had been none other than the

       Soul of the Mirror.
He therefore resolved to treat the mirror with all the

    consideration due to a Spirit. After having caused it to be

    carefully repolished and resilvered, he had a case of precious

    wood made for it, and a particular room in the house prepared

    to receive it. On the evening of the same day that it had been

    respectfully deposited in that room, Yayoi herself unexpectedly

    appeared before the priest as he sat alone in his study. She

    looked even more lovely than

    [pg 135] before; but the light of

       her beauty was now soft as the light of a summer moon

       shining through pure white clouds. After having humbly

       saluted Matsumura, she said in her sweetly tinkling

       voice:—
"Now that you have saved me from solitude and sorrow, I have

    come to thank you.... I am indeed, as you supposed, the Spirit

    of the Mirror. It was in the time of the Emperor Saimei that I

    was first brought here from Kudara; and I dwelt in the august

    residence until the time of the Emperor Saga, when I was

    augustly bestowed upon the Lady Kamo, Naishinnō of the

    Imperial Court.69

       Thereafter I became an heirloom in the House of Fuji-wara,

       and so remained until the period of Hōgen, when I was

       dropped into the well. There I was left and forgotten during

       the years [pg 136] of the great

       war.70

       The Master of the Well71

       was a venomous Dragon, who used to live in a lake that once

       covered a great part of this district. After the lake had

       been filled in, by government order, in order that houses

       might be built upon the place of it, the Dragon took

       possession of the well; and when I fell into the well I

       became subject to him; and he compelled me to lure many

       people to their deaths. But the gods have banished him

       forever.... Now I have one more favor to beseech: I entreat

       that you will cause me to be offered up to the Shōgun,

       the Lord Yoshimasa, who by descent is related to my former

       possessors. Do me but this last great kindness, and it will

       bring you [pg 137] good-fortune.... But I have

       also to warn you of a danger. In this house, after

       to-morrow, you must not stay, because it will be

       destroyed."... And with these words of warning Yayoi

       disappeared.

Matsumura was able to profit by this premonition. He removed

    his people and his belongings to another district the next day;

    and almost immediately afterwards another storm arose, even

    more violent than the first, causing a flood which swept away

    the house in which he had been residing.
Some time later, by favor of the Lord Hosokawa, Matsumura

    was enabled to obtain an audience of the Shōgun Yoshimasa,

    to whom he presented the mirror, together with a written

    account of its wonderful history. Then the prediction of the

    Spirit of the Mirror was fulfilled; for the Shōgun,

    greatly pleased with this strange gift, not only bestowed

    costly presents upon Matsumura, but also made an ample grant of

    money for the rebuilding of the Temple of

    Ogawachi-Myōjin.[pg 139]
THE STORY OF ITŌ

    NORISUKÉ[pg 141]
In the town of Uji, in the province of Yamashiro, there

    lived, about six hundred years ago, a young samurai named

    Itō Tatéwaki Norisuké, whose ancestors were of the Héïké

    clan. Itō was of handsome person and amiable character, a

    good scholar and apt at arms. But his family were poor; and he

    had no patron among the military nobility,—so that his

    prospects were small. He lived in a very quiet way, devoting

    himself to the study of literature, and having (says the

    Japanese story-teller) "only the Moon and the Wind for

    friends."
One autumn evening, as he was taking a solitary walk in the

    neighborhood of the [pg 142] hill called Kotobikiyama,

       he happened to overtake a young girl who was following the

       same path. She was richly dressed, and seemed to be about

       eleven or twelve years old. Itō greeted her, and said,

       "The sun will soon be setting, damsel, and this is rather a

       lonesome place. May I ask if you have lost your way?" She

       looked up at him with a bright smile, and answered

       deprecatingly: "Nay! I am a

       miya-dzukai,72

       serving in this neighborhood; and I have only a little way

       to go."
By her use of the term miya-dzukai, Itō knew

    that the girl must be in the service of persons of rank; and

    her statement surprised him, because he had never heard of any

    family of distinction residing in that vicinity. But he only

    said: "I am returning to Uji, where my home is. Perhaps you

    will allow me to accompany you on the way, as this is a very

    lonesome place." She thanked him gracefully, seeming pleased by

    his offer; and they walked on together, chatting as they went.

    She talked about the weather, the flowers, the butterflies,

    [pg 143] and the birds; about a

       visit that she had once made to Uji, about the famous sights

       of the capital, where she had been born;—and the

       moments passed pleasantly for Itō, as he listened to

       her fresh prattle. Presently, at a turn in the road, they

       entered a hamlet, densely shadowed by a grove of young

       trees.

[Here I must interrupt the story to tell you that, without

    having actually seen them, you cannot imagine how dark some

    Japanese country villages remain even in the brightest and

    hottest weather. In the neighborhood of Tōkyō itself

    there are many villages of this kind. At a short distance from

    such a settlement you see no houses: nothing is visible but a

    dense grove of evergreen trees. The grove, which is usually

    composed of young cedars and bamboos, serves to shelter the

    village from storms, and also to supply timber for various

    purposes. So closely are the trees planted that there is no

    room to pass between the trunks of them: they stand straight as

    masts, and mingle their crests so as to form a roof that

    excludes [pg 144] the sun. Each thatched

       cottage occupies a clear space in the plantation, the trees

       forming a fence about it, double the height of the building.

       Under the trees it is always twilight, even at high noon;

       and the houses, morning or evening, are half in shadow. What

       makes the first impression of such a village almost

       disquieting is, not the transparent gloom, which has a

       certain weird charm of its own, but the stillness. There may

       be fifty or a hundred dwellings; but you see nobody; and you

       hear no sound but the twitter of invisible birds, the

       occasional crowing of cocks, and the shrilling of cicadæ.

       Even the cicadæ, however, find these groves too dim, and

       sing faintly; being sun-lovers, they prefer the trees

       outside the village. I forgot to say that you may sometimes

       hear a viewless shuttle—chaka-ton,

       chaka-ton;—but that familiar sound, in the great

       green silence, seems an elfish happening. The reason of the

       hush is simply that the people are not at home. All the

       adults, excepting some feeble elders, have gone to the

       neighboring fields, the women carrying their babies on their

       backs; and most [pg 145] of the children have gone

       to the nearest school, perhaps not less than a mile away.

       Verily, in these dim hushed villages, one seems to behold

       the mysterious perpetuation of conditions recorded in the

       texts of Kwang-Tze:—

"The ancients who had the nourishment of the world

        wished for nothing, and the world had enough:—they

        did nothing, and all things were transformed:—their

        stillness was abysmal, and the people were all

        composed."]


... The village was very dark when Itō reached it; for

    the sun had set, and the after-glow made no twilight in the

    shadowing of the trees. "Now, kind sir," the child said,

    pointing to a narrow lane opening upon the main road, "I have

    to go this way." "Permit me, then, to see you home," Itō

    responded; and he turned into the lane with her, feeling rather

    than seeing his way. But the girl soon stopped before a small

    gate, dimly visible in the gloom,—a gate of trelliswork,

    beyond which the lights of a dwelling could be seen. "Here,"

    she said, "is the honorable residence in which I serve.

    [pg 146] As you have come thus far

       out of your way, kind sir, will you not deign to enter and

       to rest a while?" Itō assented. He was pleased by the

       informal invitation; and he wished to learn what persons of

       superior condition had chosen to reside in so lonesome a

       village. He knew that sometimes a family of rank would

       retire in this manner from public life, by reason of

       government displeasure or political trouble; and he imagined

       that such might be the history of the occupants of the

       dwelling before him. Passing the gate, which his young guide

       opened for him, he found himself in a large quaint garden. A

       miniature landscape, traversed by a winding stream, was

       faintly distinguishable. "Deign for one little moment to

       wait," the child said; "I go to announce the honorable

       coming;" and hurried toward the house. It was a spacious

       house, but seemed very old, and built in the fashion of

       another time. The sliding doors were not closed; but the

       lighted interior was concealed by a beautiful bamboo curtain

       extending along the gallery front. Behind it shadows were

       moving—shadows of women;—and suddenly

       [pg 147] the music of a koto

       rippled into the night. So light and sweet was the playing

       that Itō could scarcely believe the evidence of his

       senses. A slumbrous feeling of delight stole over him as he

       listened,—a delight strangely mingled with sadness. He

       wondered how any woman could have learned to play

       thus,—wondered whether the player could be a

       woman,—wondered even whether he was hearing earthly

       music; for enchantment seemed to have entered into his blood

       with the sound of it.

The soft music ceased; and almost at the same moment

    Itō found the little miya-dzukai beside him. "Sir,"

    she said, "it is requested that you will honorably enter." She

    conducted him to the entrance, where he removed his sandals;

    and an aged woman, whom he thought to be the Rōjo,

    or matron of the household, came to welcome him at the

    threshold. The old woman then led him through many apartments

    to a large and well-lighted room in the rear of the house, and

    with many respectful salutations requested him to take the

    [pg 148] place of honor accorded to

       guests of distinction. He was surprised by the stateliness

       of the chamber, and the curious beauty of its decorations.

       Presently some maid-servants brought refreshments; and he

       noticed that the cups and other vessels set before him were

       of rare and costly workmanship, and ornamented with a design

       indicating the high rank of the possessor. More and more he

       wondered what noble person had chosen this lonely retreat,

       and what happening could have inspired the wish for such

       solitude. But the aged attendant suddenly interrupted his

       reflections with the question:
"Am I wrong in supposing that you are Itō Sama, of

    Uji,—Itō Tatéwaki Norisuké?"
Itō bowed in assent. He had not told his name to the

    little miya-dzukai, and the manner of the inquiry

    startled him.
"Please do not think my question rude," continued the

    attendant. "An old woman like myself may ask questions without

    improper curiosity. When you came to the house, I thought that

    I knew your face; and I [pg 149] asked your name only to

       clear away all doubt, before speaking of other matters. I

       have some thing of moment to tell you. You often pass

       through this village, and our young

       Himégimi-Sama73

       happened one morning to see you going by; and ever since

       that moment she has been thinking about you, day and night.

       Indeed, she thought so much that she became ill; and we have

       been very uneasy about her. For that reason I took means to

       find out your name and residence; and I was on the point of

       sending you a letter when—so unexpectedly!—you

       came to our gate with the little attendant. Now, to say how

       happy I am to see you is not possible; it seems almost too

       fortunate a happening to be true! Really I think that this

       meeting must have been brought about by the favor of

       Enmusubi-no-Kami,—that great God of Izumo who ties the

       knots of fortunate union. And now that so lucky a destiny

       has led you hither, perhaps you will not refuse—if

       there [pg 150] be no obstacle in the way

       of such a union—to make happy the heart of our

       Himégimi-Sama?"
For the moment Itō did not know how to reply. If the

    old woman had spoken the truth, an extraordinary chance was

    being offered to him. Only a great passion could impel the

    daughter of a noble house to seek, of her own will, the

    affection of an obscure and masterless samurai, possessing

    neither wealth nor any sort of prospects. On the other hand, it

    was not in the honorable nature of the man to further his own

    interests by taking advantage of a feminine weakness. Moreover,

    the circumstances were disquietingly mysterious. Yet how to

    decline the proposal, so unexpectedly made, troubled him not a

    little. After a short silence, he replied:—
"There would be no obstacle, as I have no wife, and no

    betrothed, and no relation with any woman. Until now I have

    lived with my parents; and the matter of my marriage was never

    discussed by them. You must know that I am a poor samurai,

    without any patron among persons of rank; and I did not

    [pg 151] wish to marry until I could

       find some chance to improve my condition. As to the proposal

       which you have done me the very great honor to make, I can

       only say that I know myself yet unworthy of the notice of

       any noble maiden."
The old woman smiled as if pleased by these words, and

    responded:—
"Until you have seen our Himégimi-Sama, it were better that

    you make no decision. Perhaps you will feel no hesitation after

    you have seen her. Deign now to come with me, that I may

    present you to her."
She conducted him to another larger guest-room, where

    preparations for a feast had been made, and having shown him

    the place of honor, left him for a moment alone. She returned

    accompanied by the Himégimi-Sama; and, at the first sight of

    the young mistress, Itō felt again the strange thrill of

    wonder and delight that had come to him in the garden, as he

    listened to the music of the koto. Never had he dreamed

    of so beautiful a being. Light seemed to radiate from her

    presence, and to shine through her garments, as the light of

    the [pg 152] moon through flossy clouds;

       her loosely flowing hair swayed about her as she moved, like

       the boughs of the drooping willow bestirred by the breezes

       of spring; her lips were like flowers of the peach

       besprinkled with morning dew. Itō was bewildered by the

       vision. He asked himself whether he was not looking upon the

       person of Amano-kawara-no-Ori-Himé herself,—the

       Weaving-Maiden who dwells by the shining River of

       Heaven.
Smiling, the aged woman turned to the fair one, who remained

    speechless, with downcast eyes and flushing cheeks, and said to

    her:—
"See, my child!—at the moment when we could least have

    hoped for such a thing, the very person whom you wished to meet

    has come of his own accord. So fortunate a happening could have

    been brought about only by the will of the high gods. To think

    of it makes me weep for joy." And she sobbed aloud. "But now,"

    she continued, wiping away her tears with her sleeve, "it only

    remains for you both—unless either prove unwilling,

    [pg 153] which I doubt—to

       pledge yourselves to each other, and to partake of your

       wedding feast."

Itō answered by no word: the incomparable vision before

    him had numbed his will and tied his tongue. Maid-servants

    entered, bearing dishes and wine: the wedding feast was spread

    before the pair; and the pledges were given. Itō

    nevertheless remained as in a trance: the marvel of the

    adventure, and the wonder of the beauty of the bride, still

    bewildered him. A gladness, beyond aught that he had ever known

    before, filled his heart—like a great silence. But

    gradually he recovered his wonted calm; and thereafter he found

    himself able to converse without embarrassment. Of the wine he

    partook freely; and he ventured to speak, in a

    self-depreciating but merry way, about the doubts and fears

    that had oppressed him. Meanwhile the bride remained still as

    moonlight, never lifting her eyes, and replying only by a blush

    or a smile when he addressed her.
Itō said to the aged attendant:—
"Many times, in my solitary walks, I

    [pg 154] have passed through this

       village without knowing of the existence of this honorable

       dwelling. And ever since entering here, I have been

       wondering why this noble household should have chosen so

       lonesome a place of sojourn.... Now that your Himégimi-Sama

       and I have become pledged to each other, it seems to me a

       strange thing that I do not yet know the name of her august

       family."
At this utterance, a shadow passed over the kindly face of

    the old woman; and the bride, who had yet hardly spoken, turned

    pale, and appeared to become painfully anxious. After some

    moments of silence, the aged woman responded:—
"To keep our secret from you much longer would be difficult;

    and I think that, under any circumstances, you should be made

    aware of the facts, now that you are one of us. Know then, Sir

    Itō, that your bride is the daughter of

    Shigéhira-Kyō, the great and unfortunate San-mi

    Chüjō."
At those words—"Shigéhira-Kyō, San-mi

    Chüjō"—the young samurai felt a

    [pg 155] chill, as of ice, strike

       through all his veins. Shigéhira-Kyō, the great Héïké

       general and statesman, had been dust for centuries. And

       Itō suddenly understood that everything around

       him—the chamber and the lights and the

       banquet—was a dream of the past; that the forms before

       him were not people, but shadows of people dead.
But in another instant the icy chill had passed; and the

    charm returned, and seemed to deepen about him; and he felt no

    fear. Though his bride had come to him out of Yomi,—out

    of the place of the Yellow Springs of death,—his heart

    had been wholly won. Who weds a ghost must become a

    ghost;—yet he knew himself ready to die, not once, but

    many times, rather than betray by word or look one thought that

    might bring a shadow of pain to the brow of the beautiful

    illusion before him. Of the affection proffered he had no

    misgiving: the truth had been told him when any unloving

    purpose might better have been served by deception. But these

    thoughts and emotions passed in a flash, leaving him resolved

    [pg 156] to accept the strange

       situation as it had presented itself, and to act just as he

       would have done if chosen, in the years of Jü-ei, by

       Shigéhira's daughter.
"Ah, the pity of it!" he exclaimed; "I have heard of the

    cruel fate of the august Lord Shigéhira."
"Ay," responded the aged woman, sobbing as she

    spoke;—"it was indeed a cruel fate. His horse, you know,

    was killed by an arrow, and fell upon him; and when he called

    for help, those who had lived upon his bounty deserted him in

    his need. Then he was taken prisoner, and sent to Kamakura,

    where they treated him shamefully, and at last put him to

    death.74

       His wife and child—this dear maid

       [pg 157] here—were then in

       hiding; for everywhere the Héïké were being sought out and

       killed. When the news of the Lord Shigéhira's death reached

       us, the pain proved too great for the mother to bear, so the

       child was left with no one to care for her but

       me,—since her kindred had all perished or disappeared.

       She was only five years old. I had been her milk-nurse, and

       I did what I could for her. Year after year we wandered from

       place to place, traveling in pilgrim-garb.... But these

       tales of grief are ill-timed," exclaimed the nurse, wiping

       away her tears;—"pardon the foolish heart of an old

       woman who cannot forget the past. See! the little maid whom

       I fostered has now become a Himégimi-Sama indeed!—were

       we living in the good days of the Emperor Takakura, what a

       destiny might be reserved for her! However, she has obtained

       the husband [pg 158] whom she desired; that is

       the greatest happiness.... But the hour is late. The

       bridal-chamber has been prepared; and I must now leave you

       to care for each other until morning."
She rose, and sliding back the screens parting the

    guest-room from the adjoining chamber, ushered them to their

    sleeping apartment. Then, with many words of joy and

    congratulation, she withdrew; and Itō was left alone with

    his bride.
As they reposed together, Itō said:—
"Tell me, my loved one, when was it that you first wished to

    have me for your husband."
(For everything appeared so real that he had almost ceased

    to think of the illusion woven around him.)
She answered, in a voice like a dove's voice:—
"My august lord and husband, it was at the temple of

    Ishiyama, where I went with my foster-mother, that I saw you

    for the first time. And because of seeing you, the world became

    changed to me from that hour and

    [pg 159] moment. But you do not

       remember, because our meeting was not in this, your present

       life: it was very, very long ago. Since that time you have

       passed through many deaths and births, and have had many

       comely bodies. But I have remained always that which you see

       me now: I could not obtain another body, nor enter into

       another state of existence, because of my great wish for

       you. My dear lord and husband, I have waited for you through

       many ages of men."
And the bridegroom felt nowise afraid at hearing these

    strange words, but desired nothing more in life, or in all his

    lives to come, than to feel her arms about him, and to hear the

    caress of her voice.

But the pealing of a temple-bell proclaimed the coming of

    dawn. Birds began to twitter; a morning breeze set all the

    trees a-whispering. Suddenly the old nurse pushed apart the

    sliding screens of the bridal-chamber, and

    exclaimed:—
"My children, it is time to separate! By daylight you must

    not be together, even for

    [pg 160] an instant: that were

       fatal! You must bid each other good-by."
Without a word, Itō made ready to depart. He vaguely

    understood the warning uttered, and resigned himself wholly to

    destiny. His will belonged to him no more; he desired only to

    please his shadowy bride.
She placed in his hands a little suzuri, or

    ink-stone, curiously carved, and said:—
"My young lord and husband is a scholar; therefore this

    small gift will probably not be despised by him. It is of

    strange fashion because it is old, having been augustly

    bestowed upon my father by the favor of the Emperor Takakura.

    For that reason only, I thought it to be a precious thing."
Itō, in return, besought her to accept for a

    remembrance the kōgai75

       of his sword, which were decorated with inlaid work of

       silver and gold, representing plum-flowers and

       nightingales.[pg 161]
Then the little miya-dzukai came to guide him through

    the garden, and his bride with her foster-mother accompanied

    him to the threshold.
As he turned at the foot of the steps to make his parting

    salute, the old woman said:—
"We shall meet again the next Year of the Boar, at the same

    hour of the same day of the same month that you came here. This

    being the Year of the Tiger, you will have to wait ten years.

    But, for reasons which I must not say, we shall not be able to

    meet again in this place; we are going to the neighborhood of

    Kyōto, where the good Emperor Takakura and our fathers and

    many of our people are dwelling. All the Héïké will be rejoiced

    by your coming. We shall send a

    kago76

       for you on the appointed day."

Above the village the stars were burning as Itō passed

    the gate; but on reaching the open road he saw the dawn

    brightening beyond [pg 162] leagues of silent fields.

       In his bosom he carried the gift of his bride. The charm of

       her voice lingered in his ears,—and nevertheless, had

       it not been for the memento which he touched with

       questioning fingers, he could have persuaded himself that

       the memories of the night were memories of sleep, and that

       his life still belonged to him.
But the certainty that he had doomed himself evoked no least

    regret: he was troubled only by the pain of separation, and the

    thought of the seasons that would have to pass before the

    illusion could be renewed for him. Ten years!—and every

    day of those years would seem how long! The mystery of the

    delay he could not hope to solve; the secret ways of the dead

    are known to the gods alone.

Often and often, in his solitary walks, Itō revisited

    the village at Kotobikiyama, vaguely hoping to obtain another

    glimpse of the past. But never again, by night or by day, was

    he able to find the rustic gate in the shadowed lane; never

    again could he perceive the figure

    [pg 163] of the little

       miya-dzukai, walking alone in the sunset-glow.
The village people, whom he questioned carefully, thought

    him bewitched. No person of rank, they said, had ever dwelt in

    the settlement; and there had never been, in the neighborhood,

    any such garden as he described. But there had once been a

    great Buddhist temple near the place of which he spoke; and

    some gravestones of the temple-cemetery were still to be seen.

    Itō discovered the monuments in the middle of a dense

    thicket. They were of an ancient Chinese form, and were covered

    with moss and lichens. The characters that had been cut upon

    them could no longer be deciphered.

Of his adventure Itō spoke to no one. But friends and

    kindred soon perceived a great change in his appearance and

    manner. Day by day he seemed to become more pale and thin,

    though physicians declared that he had no bodily ailment; he

    looked like a ghost, and moved like a shadow. Thoughtful and

    solitary he had always been, but now he appeared indifferent

    [pg 164] to everything which had

       formerly given him pleasure,—even to those literary

       studies by means of which he might have hoped to win

       distinction. To his mother—who thought that marriage

       might quicken his former ambition, and revive his interest

       in life—he said that he had made a vow to marry no

       living woman. And the months dragged by.
At last came the Year of the Boar, and the season of autumn;

    but I to could no longer take the solitary walks that he loved.

    He could not even rise from his bed. His life was ebbing,

    though none could divine the cause; and he slept so deeply and

    so long that his sleep was often mistaken for death.
Out of such a sleep he was startled, one bright evening, by

    the voice of a child; and he saw at his bedside the little

    miya-dsukai who had guided him, ten years before, to the

    gate of the vanished garden. She saluted him, and smiled, and

    said: "I am bidden to tell you that you will be received

    to-night at Öhara, near Kyōto, where the new home is, and

    that a kago has been sent for you." Then she

    disappeared.[pg 165]
Itō knew that he was being summoned away from the light

    of the sun; but the message so rejoiced him that he found

    strength to sit up and call his mother. To her he then for the

    first time related the story of his bridal, and he showed her

    the ink-stone which had been given him. He asked that it should

    be placed in his coffin,—and then he died.

The ink-stone was buried with him. But before the funeral

    ceremonies it was examined by experts, who said that it had

    been made in the period of Jō-an(1169 A.D.), and

    that it bore the seal-mark of an artist who had lived in the

    time of the Emperor

    Takakura.[pg 167]
STRANGER THAN

    FICTION[pg 169]
It was a perfect West Indian day. My friend the notary and I

    were crossing the island by a wonderful road which wound up

    through tropic forest to the clouds, and thence looped down

    again, through gold-green slopes of cane, and scenery amazing

    of violet and blue and ghost-gray peaks, to the roaring coast

    of the trade winds. All the morning we had been

    ascending,—walking after our carriage, most of the time,

    for the sake of the brave little mule;—and the sea had

    been climbing behind us till it looked like a monstrous wall of

    blue, pansy-blue, under the ever heightening horizon. The heat

    was like the heat of a vapor-bath, but the air was good to

    breathe with its tropical odor,—an odor made up of smells

    of strange [pg 170] saps, queer spicy scents of

       mould, exhalations of aromatic decay. Moreover, the views

       were glimpses of Paradise; and it was a joy to watch the

       torrents roaring down their gorges under shadows of

       tree-fern and bamboo.
My friend stopped the carriage before a gateway set into a

    hedge full of flowers that looked like pink-and-white

    butterflies. "I have to make a call here," he said;—"come

    in with me." We dismounted, and he knocked on the gate with the

    butt of his whip. Within, at the end of a shady garden, I could

    see the porch of a planter's house; beyond were rows of cocoa

    palms, and glimpses of yellowing cane. Presently a negro,

    wearing only a pair of canvas trousers and a great straw hat,

    came hobbling to open the gate,—followed by a multitude,

    an astonishing multitude, of chippering chickens. Under the

    shadow of that huge straw hat I could not see the negro's face;

    but I noticed that his limbs and body were strangely

    shrunken,—looked as if withered to the bone. A weirder

    creature I had never beheld; and I wondered at his following of

    chickens.[pg 171]
"Eh!" exclaimed the notary, "your chickens are as lively as

    ever!... I want to see Madame Floran."
"Moin ké di," the goblin responded huskily, in his

    patois; and he limped on before us, all the chickens hopping

    and cheeping at his withered heels.
"That fellow," my friend observed, "was bitten by a

    fer-de-lance about eight or nine years ago. He got

    cured, or at least half-cured, in some extraordinary way; but

    ever since then he has been a skeleton. See how he limps!"
The skeleton passed out of sight behind the house, and we

    waited a while at the front porch. Then a

    métisse—turbaned in wasp colors, and robed in iris

    colors, and wonderful to behold—came to tell us that

    Madame hoped we would rest ourselves in the garden, as the

    house was very warm. Chairs and a little table were then set

    for us in a shady place, and the métisse brought out lemons,

    sugar-syrup, a bottle of the clear plantation rum that smells

    like apple juice, and ice-cold water in a dobanne of

    thick red clay. My friend prepared the

    [pg 172] refreshments; and then our

       hostess came to greet us, and to sit with us,—a nice

       old lady with hair like newly minted silver. I had never

       seen a smile sweeter than that with which she bade us

       welcome; and I wondered whether she could ever have been

       more charming in her Creole girlhood than she now

       appeared,—with her kindly wrinkles, and argent hair,

       and frank, black, sparkling eyes....

In the conversation that followed I was not able to take

    part, as it related only to some question of title. The notary

    soon arranged whatever there was to arrange; and, after some

    charmingly spoken words of farewell from the gentle lady, we

    took our departure. Again the mummified negro hobbled before

    us, to open the gate,—followed by all his callow rabble

    of chickens. As we resumed our places in the carriage we could

    still hear the chippering of the creatures, pursuing after that

    ancient scarecrow.
"Is it African sorcery?" I queried.... "How does he bewitch

    those chickens?"[pg 173]
"Queer—is it not?" the notary responded as we drove

    away. "That negro must now be at least eighty years old; and he

    may live for twenty years more,—the wretch!"
The tone in which my friend uttered this epithet—le

    miserable!—somewhat surprised me, as I knew him to be

    one of the kindliest men in the world, and singularly free from

    prejudice. I suspected that a story was coming, and I waited

    for it in silence.
"Listen," said the notary, after a pause, during which we

    left the plantation well behind us; "that old sorcerer, as you

    call him, was born upon the estate, a slave. The estate

    belonged to M. Floran,—the husband of the lady whom we

    visited; and she was a cousin, and the marriage was a

    love-match. They had been married about two years when the

    revolt occurred (fortunately there were no children),—the

    black revolt of eighteen hundred and forty-eight. Several

    planters were murdered; and M. Floran was one of the first to

    be killed. And the old negro whom we saw to-day—the old

    sorcerer, as you call him—left the

    [pg 174] plantation, and joined the

       rising: do you understand?"
"Yes," I said; "but he might have done that through fear of

    the mob."
"Certainly: the other hands did the same. But it was he that

    killed M. Floran,—for no reason whatever,—cut him

    up with a cutlass. M. Floran was riding home when the attack

    was made,—about a mile below the plantation.... Sober,

    that negro would not have dared to face M. Floran: the

    scoundrel was drunk, of course,—raving drunk. Most of the

    blacks had been drinking tafia, with dead wasps in it, to give

    themselves courage."
"But," I interrupted, "how does it happen that the fellow is

    still on the Floran plantation?"
"Wait a moment!... When the military got control of the mob,

    search was made everywhere for the murderer of M. Floran; but

    he could not be found. He was lying out in the cane,—in

    M. Floran's cane!—like a field-rat, like a snake. One

    morning, while the gendarmes were still looking for him, he

    rushed [pg 175] into the house, and threw

       himself down in front of Madame, weeping and screaming,

       'Aïe-yaïe-yaïe-yaïe!—moin té tchoué y! moin té

       tchoué y!—aïe-yaïe-yaïe!' Those were his very

       words:—'I killed him! I killed him!' And he begged for

       mercy. When he was asked why he killed M. Floran, he cried

       out that it was the devil—diabe-à—that

       had made him do it!... Well, Madame forgave him!"
"But how could she?" I queried.
"Oh, she had always been very religious," my friend

    responded,—"sincerely religious. She only said, 'May God

    pardon me as I now pardon you!' She made her servants hide the

    creature and feed him; and they kept him hidden until the

    excitement was over. Then she sent him back to work; and he has

    been working for her ever since. Of course he is now too old to

    be of any use in the field;—he only takes care of the

    chickens."
"But how," I persisted, "could the relatives allow Madame to

    forgive him?"
"Well, Madame insisted that he was not mentally

    responsible,—that he was only a

    [pg 176] poor fool who had killed

       without knowing what he was doing; and she argued that if

       she could forgive him, others could more easily do

       the same. There was a consultation; and the relatives

       decided so to arrange matters that Madame could have her own

       way."
"But why?"
"Because they knew that she found a sort of religious

    consolation—a kind of religious comfort—in

    forgiving the wretch. She imagined that it was her duty as a

    Christian, not only to forgive him, but to take care of him. We

    thought that she was mistaken,—but we could

    understand.... Well, there is an example of what religion can

    do."...

The surprise of a new fact, or the sudden perception of

    something never before imagined, may cause an involuntary

    smile. Unconsciously I smiled, while my friend was yet

    speaking; and the good notary's brow darkened.
"Ah, you laugh!" he exclaimed,—"you laugh! That is

    wrong!—that is a [pg 177] mistake!... But you do not

       believe: you do not know what it is,—the true

       religion,—the real Christianity!"
Earnestly I made answer:—
"Pardon me! I do believe every word of what you have told

    me. If I laughed unthinkingly, it was only because I could not

    help wondering" ...
"At what?" he questioned gravely.
"At the marvelous instinct of that negro."
"Ah, yes!" he returned approvingly. "Yes, the cunning of the

    animal it was,—the instinct of the brute!... She was the

    only person in the world who could have saved him."
"And he knew it," I ventured to add.
"No—no—no!" my friend emphatically

    dissented,—"he never could have known it! He only

    felt it!... Find me an instinct like that, and I will

    show you a brain incapable of any knowledge, any thinking, any

    understanding: not the mind of a man, but the brain of a

    beast!"[pg 179]
A LETTER FROM

    JAPAN[pg 181]
Tokyo, August 1, 1904.
Here, in this quiet suburb, where the green peace is broken

    only by the voices of children at play and the shrilling of

    cicadæ, it is difficult to imagine that, a few hundred miles

    away, there is being carried on one of the most tremendous wars

    of modern times, between armies aggregating more than half a

    million of men, or that, on the intervening sea, a hundred

    ships of war have been battling. This contest, between the

    mightiest of Western powers and a people that began to study

    Western science only within the recollection of many persons

    still in vigorous life, is, on one side at least, a struggle

    for national existence. It was inevitable,

    [pg 182] this struggle,—might

       perhaps have been delayed, but certainly not averted. Japan

       has boldly challenged an empire capable of threatening

       simultaneously the civilizations of the East and the

       West,—a mediæval power that, unless vigorously

       checked, seems destined to absorb Scandinavia and to

       dominate China. For all industrial civilization the contest

       is one of vast moment;—for Japan it is probably the

       supreme crisis in her national life. As to what her fleets

       and her armies have been doing, the world is fully informed;

       but as to what her people are doing at home, little has been

       written.
To inexperienced observation they would appear to be doing

    nothing unusual; and this strange calm is worthy of record. At

    the beginning of hostilities an Imperial mandate was issued,

    bidding all non-combatants to pursue their avocations as usual,

    and to trouble themselves as little as possible about exterior

    events;—and this command has been obeyed to the letter.

    It would be natural to suppose that all the sacrifices,

    tragedies, and uncertainties of the contest had thrown their

    gloom over the life of [pg 183] the capital in especial;

       but there is really nothing whatever to indicate a condition

       of anxiety or depression. On the contrary, one is astonished

       by the joyous tone of public confidence, and the admirably

       restrained pride of the nation in its victories. Western

       tides have strewn the coast with Japanese corpses; regiments

       have been blown out of existence in the storming of

       positions defended by wire-entanglements; battleships have

       been lost: yet at no moment has there been the least public

       excitement. The people are following their daily occupations

       just as they did before the war; the cheery aspect of things

       is just the same; the theatres and flower displays are not

       less well patronized. The life of Tōkyō has been,

       to outward seeming, hardly more affected by the events of

       the war than the life of nature beyond it, where the flowers

       are blooming and the butterflies hovering as in other

       summers. Except after the news of some great

       victory,—celebrated with fireworks and lantern

       processions,—there are no signs of public emotion; and

       but for the frequent distribution of newspaper extras, by

       runners ringing bells, you

       [pg 184] could almost persuade

       yourself that the whole story of the war is an evil

       dream.
Yet there has been, of necessity, a vast amount of

    suffering—viewless and voiceless

    suffering—repressed by that sense of social and patriotic

    duty which is Japanese religion. As a seventeen-syllable poem

    of the hour tells us, the news of every victory must bring pain

    as well as joy:—


Gōgwai no
Tabi teki mikata
Goké ga fuè.


[Each time that an extra is circulated the widows of

        foes and friends have increased in multitude.]

The great quiet and the smiling tearlessness testify to the

    more than Spartan discipline of the race. Anciently the people

    were trained, not only to conceal their emotions, but to speak

    in a cheerful voice and to show a pleasant face under any

    stress of moral suffering; and they are obedient to that

    teaching to-day. It would still be thought a shame to betray

    personal [pg 185] sorrow for the loss of

       those who die for Emperor and fatherland. The public seem to

       view the events of the war as they would watch the scenes of

       a popular play. They are interested without being excited;

       and their extraordinary self-control is particularly shown

       in various manifestations of the "Play-impulse." Everywhere

       the theatres are producing war dramas (based upon actual

       fact); the newspapers and magazines are publishing war

       stories and novels; the cinematograph exhibits the monstrous

       methods of modern warfare; and numberless industries are

       turning out objects of art or utility designed to

       commemorate the Japanese triumphs.
But the present psychological condition, the cheerful and

    even playful tone of public feeling, can be indicated less by

    any general statement than by the mention of ordinary

    facts,—every-day matters recorded in the writer's

    diary.

Never before were the photographers so busy; it is said that

    they have not been able [pg 186] to fulfill half of the

       demands made upon them. The hundreds of thousands of men

       sent to the war wished to leave photographs with their

       families, and also to take with them portraits of parents,

       children, and other beloved persons. The nation was being

       photographed during the past six months.
A fact of sociological interest is that photography has

    added something new to the poetry of the domestic faith. From

    the time of its first introduction, photography became popular

    in Japan; and none of those superstitions, which inspire fear

    of the camera among less civilized races, offered any obstacle

    to the rapid development of a new industry. It is true that

    there exists some queer-folk beliefs about

    photographs,—ideas of mysterious relation between the

    sun-picture and the person imaged. For example: if, in the

    photograph of a group, one figure appear indistinct or blurred,

    that is thought to be an omen of sickness or death. But this

    superstition has its industrial value: it has compelled

    photographers to be careful about their work,—especially

    in these days of war, [pg 187] when everybody wants to

       have a good clear portrait, because the portrait might be

       needed for another purpose than preservation in an

       album.
During the last twenty years there has gradually come into

    existence the custom of placing the photograph of a dead

    parent, brother, husband, or child, beside the mortuary tablet

    kept in the Buddhist household shrine. For this reason, also,

    the departing soldier wishes to leave at home a good likeness

    of himself.
The rites of domestic affection, in old samurai families,

    are not confined to the cult of the dead. On certain occasions,

    the picture of the absent parent, husband, brother, or

    betrothed, is placed in the alcove of the guest-room, and a

    feast laid out before it. The photograph, in such cases, is

    fixed upon a little stand (dai); and the feast is served

    as if the person were present. This pretty custom of preparing

    a meal for the absent is probably more ancient than any art of

    portraiture; but the modern photograph adds to the human poetry

    of the rite. In feudal time it was the

    [pg 188] rule to set the repast

       facing the direction in which the absent person had

       gone—north, south, east, or west. After a brief

       interval the covers of the vessels containing the cooked

       food were lifted and examined. If the lacquered inner

       surface was thickly beaded with vapor, all was well; but if

       the surface was dry, that was an omen of death, a sign that

       the disembodied spirit had returned to absorb the essence of

       the offerings.

As might have been expected, in a country where the

    "play-impulse" is stronger, perhaps, than in any other part of

    the world, the Zeitgeist found manifestation in the flower

    displays of the year. I visited those in my neighborhood, which

    is the Quarter of the Gardeners. This quarter is famous for its

    azaleas (tsutsuji); and every spring the azalea gardens

    attract thousands of visitors,—not only by the wonderful

    exhibition then made of shrubs which look like solid masses of

    blossom (ranging up from snowy white, through all shades of

    pink, to a flamboyant purple) but also by displays

    [pg 189] of effigies: groups of

       figures ingeniously formed with living leaves and flowers.

       These figures, life-size, usually represent famous incidents

       of history or drama. In many cases—though not in

       all—the bodies and the costumes are composed of

       foliage and flowers trained to grow about a framework; while

       the faces, feet, and hands are represented by some kind of

       flesh-colored composition.
This year, however, a majority of the displays represented

    scenes of the war,—such as an engagement between Japanese

    infantry and mounted Cossacks, a night attack by torpedo boats,

    the sinking of a battleship. In the last-mentioned display,

    Russian bluejackets appeared, swimming for their lives in a

    rough sea;—the pasteboard waves and the swimming figures

    being made to rise and fall by the pulling of a string; while

    the crackling of quick-firing guns was imitated by a mechanism

    contrived with sheets of zinc.
It is said that Admiral Tōgō sent to

    Tōkyō for some flowering-trees in pots—inasmuch

    as his responsibilities allowed him no

    [pg 190] chance of seeing the

       cherry-flowers and the plum-blossoms in their

       season,—and that the gardeners responded even too

       generously.

Almost immediately after the beginning of hostilities,

    thousands of "war pictures"—mostly cheap

    lithographs—were published. The drawing and coloring were

    better than those of the prints issued at the time of the war

    with China; but the details were to a great extent

    imaginary,—altogether imaginary as to the appearance of

    Russian troops. Pictures of the engagements with the Russian

    fleet were effective, despite some lurid exaggeration. The most

    startling things were pictures of Russian defeats in Korea,

    published before a single military engagement had taken

    place;—the artist had "flushed to anticipate the scene."

    In these prints the Russians were depicted as fleeing in utter

    rout, leaving their officers—very fine-looking

    officers—dead upon the field; while the Japanese

    infantry, with dreadfully determined faces, were coming up at a

    double. The propriety and the wisdom of thus pictorially

    [pg 191] predicting victory, and

       easy victory to boot, may be questioned. But I am told that

       the custom of so doing is an old one; and it is thought that

       to realize the common hope thus imaginatively is lucky. At

       all events, there is no attempt at deception in these

       pictorial undertakings;—they help to keep up the

       public courage, and they ought to be pleasing to the

       gods.
Some of the earlier pictures have now been realized in grim

    fact. The victories in China had been similarly foreshadowed:

    they amply justified the faith of the artist.... To-day the war

    pictures continue to multiply; but they have changed character.

    The inexorable truth of the photograph, and the sketches of the

    war correspondent, now bring all the vividness and violence of

    fact to help the artist's imagination. There was something

    naïve and theatrical in the drawings of anticipation; but the

    pictures of the hour represent the most tragic

    reality,—always becoming more terrible. At this writing,

    Japan has yet lost no single battle; but not a few of her

    victories have been dearly

    won.[pg 192]
To enumerate even a tenth of the various articles ornamented

    with designs inspired by the war—articles such as combs,

    clasps, fans, brooches, card-cases, purses—would require

    a volume. Even cakes and confectionery are stamped with naval

    or military designs; and the glass or paper windows of

    shops—not to mention the signboards—have pictures

    of Japanese victories painted upon them. At night the shop

    lanterns proclaim the pride of the nation in its fleets and

    armies; and a whole chapter might easily be written about the

    new designs in transparencies and toy lanterns. A new revolving

    lantern—turned by the air-current which its own flame

    creates—has become very popular. It represents a charge

    of Japanese infantry upon Russian defenses; and holes pierced

    in the colored paper, so as to produce a continuous vivid

    flashing while the transparency revolves, suggest the exploding

    of shells and the volleying of machine guns.
Some displays of the art-impulse, as inspired by the war,

    have been made in directions entirely unfamiliar to Western

    experience,—in [pg 193] the manufacture, for

       example, of women's hair ornaments and dress materials.

       Dress goods decorated with war pictures have actually become

       a fashion,—especially crêpe silks for underwear, and

       figured silk linings for cloaks and sleeves. More remarkable

       than these are the new hairpins;—by hairpins I mean

       those long double-pronged ornaments of flexible metal which

       are called kanzashi, and are more or less ornamented

       according to the age of the wearer. (The kanzashi

       made for young girls are highly decorative; those worn by

       older folk are plain, or adorned only with a ball of coral

       or polished stone.) The new hairpins might be called

       commemorative: one, of which the decoration represents a

       British and a Japanese flag intercrossed, celebrates the

       Anglo-Japanese alliance; another represents an officer's cap

       and sword; and the best of all is surmounted by a tiny metal

       model of a battleship. The battleship-pin is not merely

       fantastic: it is actually pretty!
As might have been expected, military and naval subjects

    occupy a large place among the year's designs for toweling. The

    [pg 194] towel designs celebrating

       naval victories have been particularly successful: they are

       mostly in white, on a blue ground; or in black, on a white

       ground. One of the best—blue and

       white—represented only a flock of gulls wheeling about

       the masthead of a sunken iron-clad, and, far away, the

       silhouettes of Japanese battleships passing to the

       horizon.... What especially struck me in this, and in

       several other designs, was the original manner in which the

       Japanese artist had seized upon the traits of the modern

       battleship,—the powerful and sinister lines of its

       shape,—just as he would have caught for us the typical

       character of a beetle or a lobster. The lines have been just

       enough exaggerated to convey, at one glance, the real

       impression made by the aspect of these iron

       monsters,—vague impression of bulk and force and

       menace, very difficult to express by ordinary methods of

       drawing.
Besides towels decorated with artistic sketches of this

    sort, there have been placed upon the market many kinds of

    towels bearing comic war pictures,—caricatures or

    cartoons [pg 195] which are amusing without

       being malignant. It will be remembered that at the time of

       the first attack made upon the Port Arthur squadron, several

       of the Russian officers were in the Dalny

       theatre,—never dreaming that the Japanese would dare

       to strike the first blow. This incident has been made the

       subject of a towel design. At one end of the towel is a

       comic study of the faces of the Russians, delightedly

       watching the gyrations of a ballet dancer. At the other end

       is a study of the faces of the same commanders when they

       find, on returning to the port, only the masts of their

       battleships above water. Another towel shows a procession of

       fish in front of a surgeon's office—waiting their

       turns to be relieved of sundry bayonets, swords, revolvers,

       and rifles, which have stuck in their throats. A third towel

       picture represents a Russian diver examining, with a

       prodigious magnifying-glass, the holes made by torpedoes in

       the hull of a sunken cruiser. Comic verses or legends, in

       cursive text, are printed beside these pictures.
The great house of Mitsui, which

    [pg 196] placed the best of these

       designs on the market, also produced some beautiful

       souvenirs of the war, in the shape of fukusa. (A

       fukusa is an ornamental silk covering, or wrapper,

       put over presents sent to friends on certain occasions, and

       returned after the present has been received.) These are

       made of the heaviest and costliest silk, and inclosed within

       appropriately decorated covers. Upon one fukusa is a

       colored picture of the cruisers Nisshin and Kasuga, under

       full steam; and upon another has been printed, in beautiful

       Chinese characters, the full text of the Imperial

       Declaration of war.
But the strangest things that I have seen in this line of

    production were silk dresses for baby girls,—figured

    stuffs which, when looked at from a little distance, appeared

    incomparably pretty, owing to the masterly juxtaposition of

    tints and colors. On closer inspection the charming design

    proved to be composed entirely of war pictures,—or,

    rather, fragments of pictures, blended into one astonishing

    combination: naval battles; burning warships; submarine mines

    exploding; torpedo boats attacking;

    [pg 197] charges of Cossacks

       repulsed by Japanese infantry; artillery rushing into

       position; storming of forts; long lines of soldiery

       advancing through mist. Here were colors of blood and fire,

       tints of morning haze and evening glow, noon-blue and

       starred night-purple, sea-gray and field-green,—most

       wonderful thing!... I suppose that the child of a military

       or naval officer might, without impropriety, be clad in such

       a robe. But then—the unspeakable pity of things!

The war toys are innumerable: I can attempt to mention only

    a few of the more remarkable kinds.
Japanese children play many sorts of card games, some of

    which are old, others quite new. There are poetical card games,

    for example, played with a pack of which each card bears the

    text of a poem, or part of a poem; and the player should be

    able to remember the name of the author of any quotation in the

    set. Then there are geographical card games, in which each of

    the cards used bears the name, and perhaps a little picture, of

    some famous site, town, [pg 198] or temple; and the player

       should be able to remember the district and province in

       which the mentioned place is situated. The latest novelty in

       this line is a pack of cards with pictures upon them of the

       Russian war vessels; and the player should be able to state

       what has become of every vessel named,—whether sunk,

       disabled, or confined in Port Arthur.
There is another card game in which the battleships,

    cruisers, and torpedo craft of both Japan and Russia are

    represented. The winner in this game destroys his "captures" by

    tearing the cards taken. But the shops keep packages of each

    class of warship cards in stock; and when all the destroyers or

    cruisers of one country have been put hors de combat,

    the defeated party can purchase new vessels abroad. One torpedo

    boat costs about one farthing; but five torpedo boats can be

    bought for a penny.
The toy-shops are crammed with models of

    battleships,—in wood, clay, porcelain, lead, and

    tin,—of many sizes and prices. Some of the larger ones,

    moved by clockwork, are named after Japanese battleships:

    Shikishima, [pg 199] Fuji, Mikasa. One

       mechanical toy represents the sinking of a Russian vessel by

       a Japanese torpedo boat. Among cheaper things of this class

       is a box of colored sand, for the representation of naval

       engagements. Children arrange the sand so as to resemble

       waves; and with each box of sand are sold two fleets of tiny

       leaden vessels. The Japanese ships are white, and the

       Russian black; and explosions of torpedoes are to be figured

       by small cuttings of vermilion paper, planted in the

       sand.

The children of the poorest classes make their own war toys;

    and I have been wondering whether those ancient feudal laws

    (translated by Professor Wigmore), which fixed the cost and

    quality of toys to be given to children, did not help to

    develop that ingenuity which the little folk display. Recently

    I saw a group of children in our neighborhood playing at the

    siege of Port Arthur, with fleets improvised out of scraps of

    wood and some rusty nails. A tub of water represented Port

    Arthur. Battleships were figured by bits of plank, into

    [pg 200] which chop-sticks had been

       fixed to represent masts, and rolls of paper to represent

       funnels. Little flags, appropriately colored, were fastened

       to the masts with rice paste. Torpedo boats were imaged by

       splinters, into each of which a short thick nail had been

       planted to indicate a smokestack. Stationary submarine mines

       were represented by small squares of wood, each having one

       long nail driven into it; and these little things, when

       dropped into water with the nail-head downwards, would keep

       up a curious bobbing motion for a long time. Other squares

       of wood, having clusters of short nails driven into them,

       represented floating mines: and the mimic battleships were

       made to drag for these, with lines of thread. The pictures

       in the Japanese papers had doubtless helped the children to

       imagine the events of the war with tolerable accuracy.
Naval caps for children have become, of course, more in

    vogue than ever before. Some of the caps bear, in Chinese

    characters of burnished metal, the name of a battleship, or the

    words Nippon Teikoku (Empire of Japan),—disposed

    [pg 201] like the characters upon

       the cap of a blue-jacket. On some caps, however, the ship's

       name appears in English letters,—Yashima, Fuji,

       etc.

The play-impulse, I had almost forgotten to say, is shared

    by the soldiers themselves,—though most of those called

    to the front do not expect to return in the body. They ask only

    to be remembered at the Spirit-Invoking Shrine

    (Shōkonsha), where the shades of all who die for

    Emperor and country are believed to gather. The men of the

    regiments temporarily quartered in our suburb, on their way to

    the war, found time to play at mimic war with the small folk of

    the neighborhood. (At all times Japanese soldiers are very kind

    to children; and the children here march with them, join in

    their military songs, and correctly salute their officers,

    feeling sure that the gravest officer will return the salute of

    a little child.) When the last regiment went away, the men

    distributed toys among the children assembled at the station to

    give them a parting [pg 202] cheer,—hairpins, with

       military symbols for ornament, to the girls; wooden infantry

       and tin cavalry to the boys. The oddest present was a small

       clay model of a Russian soldier's head, presented with the

       jocose promise: "If we come back, we shall bring you some

       real ones." In the top of the head there is a small wire

       loop, to which a rubber string can be attached. At the time

       of the war with China, little clay models of Chinese heads,

       with very long queues, were favorite toys.

The war has also suggested a variety of new designs for that

    charming object, the toko-niwa. Few of my readers know

    what a toko-niwa, or "alcove-garden," is. It is a

    miniature garden—perhaps less than two feet

    square—contrived within an ornamental shallow basin of

    porcelain or other material, and placed in the alcove of a

    guest-room by way of decoration. You may see there a tiny pond;

    a streamlet crossed by humped bridges of Chinese pattern; dwarf

    trees forming a grove, and shading the model of a Shinto

    temple; imitations [pg 203] in baked clay of stone

       lanterns,—perhaps even the appearance of a hamlet of

       thatched cottages. If the toko-niwa be not too small,

       you may see real fish swimming in the pond, or a pet

       tortoise crawling among the rockwork. Sometimes the

       miniature garden represents Hōrai, and the palace of

       the Dragon-King.
Two new varieties have come into fashion. One is a model of

    Port Arthur, showing the harbor and the forts; and with the

    materials for the display there is sold a little map, showing

    how to place certain tiny battle-ships, representing the

    imprisoned and the investing fleets. The other toko-niwa

    represents a Korean or Chinese landscape, with hill ranges and

    rivers and woods; and the appearance of a battle is created by

    masses of toy soldiers—cavalry, infantry, and

    artillery—in all positions of attack and defense. Minute

    forts of baked clay, bristling with cannon about the size of

    small pins, occupy elevated positions. When properly arranged

    the effect is panoramic. The soldiers in the foreground are

    about an inch long; those a little farther away about

    [pg 204] half as long; and those

       upon the hills are no larger than flies.
But the most remarkable novelty of this sort yet produced is

    a kind of toko-niwa recently on display at a famous shop

    in Ginza. A label bearing the inscription, Kaï-téï no

    Ikken (View of the Ocean-Bed) sufficiently explained the

    design. The suïbon, or "water-tray," containing the

    display was half filled with rocks and sand so as to resemble a

    sea-bottom; and little fishes appeared swarming in the

    fore-ground. A little farther back, upon an elevation, stood

    Otohimé, the Dragon-King's daughter, surrounded by her maiden

    attendants, and gazing, with just the shadow of a smile, at two

    men in naval uniform who were shaking hands,—dead heroes

    of the war: Admiral Makaroff and Commander Hirosé!... These had

    esteemed each other in life; and it was a happy thought thus to

    represent their friendly meeting in the world of Spirits.

Though his name is perhaps unfamiliar to English readers,

    Commander Takeo Hirosé [pg 205] has become, deservedly, one

       of Japan's national heroes. On the 27th of March, during the

       second attempt made to block the entrance to Port Arthur, he

       was killed while endeavoring to help a comrade,—a

       comrade who had formerly saved him from death. For five

       years Hirosé had been a naval attaché at St. Petersburg, and

       had made many friends in Russian naval and military circles.

       From boyhood his life had been devoted to study and duty;

       and it was commonly said of him that he had no particle of

       selfishness in his nature. Unlike most of his brother

       officers, he remained unmarried,—holding that no man

       who might be called on at any moment to lay down his life

       for his country had a moral right to marry. The only

       amusements in which he was ever known to indulge were

       physical exercises; and he was acknowledged one of the best

       jūjutsu (wrestlers) in the empire. The heroism

       of his death, at the age of thirty-six, had much less to do

       with the honors paid to his memory than the self-denying

       heroism of his life.
Now his picture is in thousands of

    [pg 206] homes, and his name is

       celebrated in every village. It is celebrated also by the

       manufacture of various souvenirs, which are sold by myriads.

       For example, there is a new fashion in sleeve-buttons,

       called Kinen-botan, or "Commemoration-buttons." Each

       button bears a miniature portrait of the commander, with the

       inscription, Shichi-shō hōkoku, "Even in

       seven successive lives—for love of country." It is

       recorded that Hirosé often cited, to friends who criticised

       his ascetic devotion to duty, the famous utterance of

       Kusunoki Masashigé, who declared, ere laying down his life

       for the Emperor Go-Daigo, that he desired to die for his

       sovereign in seven successive existences.
But the highest honor paid to the memory of Hirosé is of a

    sort now possible only in the East, though once possible also

    in the West, when the Greek or Roman patriot-hero might be

    raised, by the common love of his people, to the place of the

    Immortals.... Wine-cups of porcelain have been made, decorated

    with his portrait; and beneath the portrait appears, in

    ideographs of gold, the inscription,

    [pg 207] Gunshin Hirosé

       Chūsa. The character "gun" signifies war; the

       character "shin" a god,—either in the sense of

       divus or deus, according to circumstances; and

       the Chinese text, read in the Japanese way, is Ikusa no

       Kami. Whether that stern and valiant spirit is really

       invoked by the millions who believe that no brave soul is

       doomed to extinction, no well-spent life laid down in vain,

       no heroism cast away, I do not know. But, in any event,

       human affection and gratitude can go no farther than this;

       and it must be confessed that Old Japan is still able to

       confer honors worth dying for.

Boys and girls in all the children's schools are now singing

    the Song of Hirosé Chūsa, which is a marching song. The

    words and the music are published in a little booklet, with a

    portrait of the late commander upon the cover. Everywhere, and

    at all hours of the day, one hears this song being

    sung:—

He whose every word and deed gave to men an example

        of what the war-folk of the
[pg 208] Empire of Nippon

           should be,—Commander Hirosé: is he really

           dead?
Though the body die, the spirit dies not. He who

        wished to be reborn seven times into this world, for the

        sake of serving his country, for the sake of requiting the

        Imperial favor,—Commander Hirosé: has he really

        died?
"Since I am a son of the Country of the Gods, the

        fire of the evil-hearted Russians cannot touch

        me!"—The sturdy Takeo who spoke thus: can he really

        be dead?...
Nay! that glorious war-death meant undying

        fame;—beyond a thousand years the valiant heart shall

        live;—as to a god of war shall reverence be paid to

        him....


Observing the playful confidence of this wonderful people in

    their struggle for existence against the mightiest power of the

    West,—their perfect trust in the wisdom of their leaders

    and the valor of their armies,—the good humor of their

    irony when mocking the enemy's blunders,—their strange

    capacity to find, in the world-stirring events of the hour,

    [pg 209] the same amusement that

       they would find in watching a melodrama,—one is

       tempted to ask: "What would be the moral consequence of a

       national defeat?"... It would depend, I think, upon

       circumstances. Were Kuropatkin able to fulfill his rash

       threat of invading Japan, the nation would probably rise as

       one man. But otherwise the knowledge of any great disaster

       would be bravely borne. From time unknown Japan has been a

       land of cataclysms,—earth-quakes that ruin cities in

       the space of a moment; tidal waves, two hundred miles long,

       sweeping whole coast populations out of existence; floods

       submerging hundreds of leagues of well-tilled fields;

       eruptions burying provinces. Calamities like this have

       disciplined the race in resignation and in patience; and it

       has been well trained also to bear with courage all the

       misfortunes of war. Even by the foreign peoples that have

       been most closely in contact with her, the capacities of

       Japan remained unguessed. Perhaps her power to resist

       aggression is far surpassed by her power to endure.

The last line alludes to a charming custom of which

        mention is made in the most ancient Japanese literature.

        Lovers, ere parting, were wont to tie each other's inner

        girdle (himo) and pledge themselves to leave the

        knot untouched until the time of their next meeting. This

        poem is said to have been composed in the seventh year of

        Yōrō,—A.D. 723,—eleven hundred and

        eighty-two years ago.


Footnote 8:
(return)
Hisakata-no is a "pillow-word" used by the old

        poets in relation to celestial objects; and it is often

        difficult to translate. Mr. Aston thinks that the literal

        meaning of hisakata is simply "long-hard," in the

        sense of long-enduring,—hisa (long),

        katai (hard, or firm),—so that

        hisakata-no would have the meaning of "firmamental."

        Japanese commentators, however, say that the term is

        composed with the three words, hi (sun), sasu

        (shine), and kata (side);—and this etymology

        would justify the rendering of hisakata-no by some

        such expression as "light-shedding," "radiance-giving." On

        the subject of pillow-words, see Aston's Grammar of the

        Japanese Written Language.

Lit., "not to cry out (will be) good"—but a

        literal translation of the poem is scarcely possible.


Footnote 12:
(return)
That is to say, "wife." In archaic Japanese the word

        imo signified both "wife" and "younger sister." The

        term might also be rendered "darling" or "beloved."


Footnote 13:
(return)
Yachihoko-no-Kami, who has many other names, is the

        Great God of Izumo, and is commonly known by his

        appellation Oho-kuni-nushi-no-Kami, or the

        "Deity-Master-of-the Great-Land." He is locally worshiped

        also as the god of marriage,—for which reason,

        perhaps, the poet thus refers to him.


Footnote 14:
(return)
Or, "my seldom-visited spouse." The word tsuma

        (zuma), in ancient Japanese, signified either wife

        or husband; and this poem might be rendered so as to

        express either the wife's or the husband's thoughts.

The literal meaning is "béni-tinted

        rouge.


Footnote 17:

In ancient Japanese the word séko signified

"To exchange jewel-pillows" signifies to use each

        used in the earliest Japanese literature. The word for

        jewel, tama, often appears in compounds as an

        equivalent of "precious," "dear," etc.

Footnote 21:

At different times, in the history of Japanese female

        costume, different articles of dress were called by this

        name. In the present instance, the hiré referred to

        was probably a white scarf, worn about the neck and carried

        over the shoulders to the breast, where its ends were

        either allowed to hang loose, or were tied into an

        ornamental knot. The hiré was often used to make

        signals with, much as handkerchiefs are waved to-day for

        the same purpose;—and the question uttered in the

        poem seems to signify: "Can that be Tanabata waving her

        scarf—to call me?" In very early times, the ordinary

        costumes worn were white.


Footnote 22:
(return)
Or, "the creaking of the oar." (The word kaji

        to-day means "helm";—the single oar, or scull,

        working upon a pivot, and serving at once for rudder and

        oar, being now called ro.) The mist passing across

        the Amanogawa is, according to commentators, the spray from

        the Star-god's oar.

Nubatama no yo might better be rendered by some

        such phrase as "the berry-black night,"—but the

        intended effect would be thus lost in translation.

        Nubatama-no (a "pillow-word") is written with

        characters signifying "like the black fruits of

        Karasu-Ōgi;" and the ancient phrase

        "nubatama no yo" therefore may be said to have the

        same meaning as our expressions "jet-black night," or

        "pitch-dark night."


Footnote 25:
(return)
Composed by the famous poet Ōtomo no Sukuné

        Yakamochi, while gazing at the Milky Way, on the seventh

        night of the seventh month of the tenth year of Tampyō

Asobimé, a courtesan: lit., "sporting-woman." The

        Éta and other pariah classes furnished a large proportion

        of these women. The whole meaning of the poem is as

        follows: "See that young wanton with her lantern! It is a

        pretty sight—but so is the sight of a fox, when the

        creature kindles his goblin-fire and assumes the shape of a

        girl. And just as your fox-woman will prove to be no more

        than an old horse-bone, so that young courtesan, whose

        beauty deludes men to folly, may be nothing better than an

        Éta."

The supposed utterance of a belated traveler frightened

        by a will-o'-the-wisp. The last line allows of two

        readings. Kokoro-hosoi means "timid;" and hosoi

        michi (hoso-michi) means a "narrow path," and,

        by implication, a "lonesome path."


Footnote 28:
(return)
The Japanese say of a person greatly emaciated by

        sickness, miru-kagé mo naki: "Even a visible shadow

        of him is not!"—Another rendering is made possible by

        the fact that the same expression is used in the sense of

        "unfit to be seen,"—"though the face of the person

        afflicted with this ghostly sickness is unfit to be seen,

        yet by reason of her secret longing [for another man] there

        are now two of her faces to be seen." The phrase omoi no

        hoka, in the fourth line, means "contrary to

        expectation;" but it is ingeniously made to suggest also

        the idea of secret longing.


Footnote 29:
(return)
There is a curious play on words in the fourth line. The

        word omoté, meaning "the front," might, in reading,

        be sounded as omotté, "thinking." The verses

        therefore might also be thus translated:—"She keeps

        her real thoughts hidden in the back part of the house, and

        never allows them to be seen in the front part of the

        house,—because she is suffering from the

        'Shadow-Sickness' [of love]."


Footnote 30:
(return)
There is a double meaning, suggested rather than

        expressed, in the fourth line. The word shiraga,

        "white-hair," suggests shirazu, "not knowing."


Footnote 31:
(return)
There is in this poem a multiplicity of suggestion

        impossible to render in translation. While making her

        toilet, the Japanese woman uses two mirrors

        (awasé-kagami)—one of which, a hand-mirror,

        serves to show her the appearance of the back part of her

        coiffure, by reflecting it into the larger stationary

        mirror. But in this case of Rikombyō, the woman sees

        more than her face and the back of her head in the larger

        mirror: she sees her own double. The verses indicate that

        one of the mirrors may have caught the Shadow-Sickness, and

        doubled itself. And there is a further suggestion of the

        ghostly sympathy said to exist between a mirror and the

        soul of its possessor.


Footnote 32:
(return)
There are two Japanese words, keshō, which

        in kana are written alike and pronounced alike,

        though represented by very different Chinese characters. As

        written in kana, the term keshō-no-mono

        may signify either "toilet articles" or "a monstrous

        being," "a goblin."


Footnote 33:
(return)
Hinagata means especially "a model," "a miniature

        copy," "a drawn plan," etc.


Footnote 34:
(return)
It is not possible to render all the double meanings in

        this composition. Tsuka-no-ma signifies "in a

        moment" or "quickly"; but it may also mean "in the space

        [ma] between the roof-props" [tsuka].

        "Kéta" means a cross-beam, but kéta-kéta

        warau means to chuckle or laugh in a mocking way.

        Ghosts are said to laugh with the sound of kéta-kéta.


Footnote 35:
(return)
The ordinary height of a full screen is six Japanese

        feet.


Footnote 36:
(return)
Kōgai is the name now given to a

        quadrangular bar of tortoise-shell passed under the

        coiffure, which leaves only the ends of the bar exposed.

        The true hair-pin is called kanzashi.


Footnote 37:
(return)
The term shirayuki, as here used, offers an

        example of what Japanese poets call Kenyōgen,

        or "double-purpose words." Joined to the words immediately

        following, it makes the phrase "white-snow woman"

        (shirayuki no onna);—united with the words

        immediately preceding, it suggests the reading,

        "whither-gone not-knowing" (yuku é wa

        shira[zu]).


Footnote 38:
(return)
Zotto is a difficult word to render literally:

        perhaps the nearest English equivalent is "thrilling."

        Zotto suru signifies "to cause a thrill" or "to give

        a shock," or "to make shiver;" and of a very beautiful

        person it is said "Zotto-suru hodo no

        bijin,"—meaning! "She is so pretty that it gives

        one a shock merely to look at her." The term

        yanagi-goshi ("willow-loins") in the last line is a

        common expression designating a slender and graceful

        figure; and the reader should observe that the first half

        of the term is ingeniously made to do double duty

        here,—suggesting, with the context, not only the

        grace of willow branches weighed down by snow, but also the

        grace of a human figure that one must stop to admire, in

        spite of the cold.


Footnote 39:
(return)
Hishaku, a wooden dipper with a long handle, used

        to transfer water from a bucket to smaller vessels.


Footnote 40:
(return)
The common expression Koshi ga nukéru (to have

        one's loins taken out) means to be unable to stand up by

        reason of fear. The suggestion is that while the captain

        was trying to knock out the bottom of a dipper, before

        giving it to the ghost, he fell senseless from fright.


Footnote 41:
(return)
The Underworld of the Dead—Yomi or

        Kōsen—is called "The Yellow Springs;" these

        names being written with two Chinese characters

        respectively signifying "yellow" and "fountain." A very

        ancient term for the ocean, frequently used in the old

        Shintō rituals, is "The Blue Sea-Plain."


Footnote 42:
(return)
There is an untranslatable play upon words in the last

        two lines. The above rendering includes two possible

        readings.


Footnote 43:
(return)
There is more weirdness in this poem than the above

        rendering suggests. The word ukaman in the fourth

        line can be rendered as "shall perhaps float," or as "shall

        perhaps be saved" (in the Buddhist sense of

        salvation),—as there are two verbs ukami.

        According to an old superstition, the spirits of the

        drowned must continue to dwell in the waters until such

        time as they can lure the living to destruction. When

        the ghost of any drowned person succeeds in drowning

        somebody, it may be able to obtain rebirth, and to leave

        the sea forever. The exclamation of the ghost in this poem

        really means, "Now perhaps I shall be able to drown

        somebody." (A very similar superstition is said to exist on

        the Breton coast.) A common Japanese saying about a child

        or any person who follows another too closely and

        persistently is: Kawa de shinda-yūréï no yona

        tsuré-hoshigaru!—"Wants to follow you everywhere

        like the ghost of a drowned person."


Footnote 44:
(return)
Here I cannot attempt to render the various plays upon

        words; but the term "omoï" needs explanation. It

        means "thought" or "thoughts;" but in colloquial

        phraseology it is often used as a euphemism for a dying

        person's last desire of vengeance. In various dramas it has

        been used in the signification of "avenging ghost." Thus

        the exclamation, "His thought has come

        back!"—in reference to a dead man—really means:

        "His angry ghost appears!"


Footnote 45:
(return)
There is a double meaning given by the use of the name

        Tomomori in the last line. Tomo means "the

        stern" of a ship; mori means "to leak." So the poem

        suggests that the ghost of Tomomori not only interferes

        with the ship's rudder, but causes her to leak.


Footnote 46:
(return)
Namakusaki-kaze really means a wind having a "raw

        stench;" but the smell of bait is suggested by the second

        line of the poem. A literal rendering is not possible in

        this case; the art of the composition being altogether

        suggestive.


Footnote 47:
(return)
Hi, the third syllable of the first line of the

        poem, does duty for hi, signifying "ebb," and for

        hikata, "dry beach." Séïzoroë is a noun

        signifying "battle-array"—in the sense of the Roman

        term acies;—and séïzoroé shité means

        "drawn up in battle-array."


Footnote 48:
(return)
The ensign of the Héïké, or Taïra clan was red; while

        that of their rivals, the Genji or Minamotō, was

        white.


Footnote 49:
(return)
The use of the word hasami in the fifth line is a

        very good example of kenyōgen. There is a noun

        hasami, meaning the nippers of a crab, or a pair of

        scissors; and there is a verb hasami, meaning to

        harbor, to cherish, or to entertain. (Ikon wo hasamu

        means "to harbor resentment against.") Reading the word

        only in connection with those which follow it, we have the

        phrase hasami mochikéri, "got claws;" but, reading

        it with the words preceding, we have the expression ikon

        wo muné ni hasami, "resentment in their breasts

        nourishing."


Footnote 50:
(return)
The tokonoma in a Japanese room is a sort of

        ornamental recess or alcove, in which a picture is usually

        hung, and vases of flowers, or a dwarf tree, are

        placed.


Footnote 51:
(return)
The word takumi, as written in kana, may

        signify either "carpenter" or "intrigue," "evil plot,"

        "wicked device." Thus two readings are possible. According

        to one reading, the post was fixed upside-down through

        inadvertence; according to the other, it was so fixed with

        malice prepense.


Footnote 52:
(return)
Lit., "upside-down-matter-sorrow." Sakasama-goto,

        "up-side-down affair," is a common expression for calamity,

        contrariety, adversity, vexation.


Footnote 53:
(return)
Alluding to the proverb, Kabé ni mimi ari ("There

        are ears in the wall"), which signifies: "Be careful how

        you talk about other people, even in private."


Footnote 54:
(return)
There is a pun in the fourth line which suggests more

        than even a free translation can express. Waré means

        "I," or "mine," or "one's own," etc., according to

        circumstances; and waré mé (written separately)

        might be rendered "its own eyes." But warémé (one

        word) means a crack, rent, split, or fissure. The reader

        should remember that the term saka-bashira means not

        only "upside-down post," but also the goblin or spectre of

        the upside-down post.


Footnote 55:
(return)
That is to say, "Even the poem on the tablet is

        up-side-down,"—all wrong. Hashira-kaké

        ("pillar-suspended thing") is the name given to a thin

        tablet of fine wood, inscribed or painted, which is hung to

        a post by way of ornament.


Footnote 56:
(return)
Perhaps the term might be rendered "Shape-changing

        Jizō." The verb bakéru means to change shape,

        to undergo metamorphosis, to haunt, and many other

        supernatural things.


Footnote 57:
(return)
The Japanese word for granite is mikagé; and

        there is also an honorific term mikagé, applied to

        divinities and emperors, which signifies "august aspect,"

        "sacred presence," etc.... No literal rendering can suggest

        the effect, in the fifth line, of the latter reading.

        Kagé signifies "shadow," "aspect," and

        "power"—especially occult power; the honorific prefix

        mi, attached to names and attributes of divinities,

        may be rendered "august."


Footnote 58:
(return)
The puns are too much for me.... Ayashii means

        "suspicious," "marvelous," "supernatural," "weird,"

        "doubtful."—In the first two lines there is a

        reference to the Buddhist proverb: Funa-ita ichi-mai

        shita wa Jigoku ("under the thickness of a single

        ship's-plank is Hell"). (See my Gleanings in

        Buddha-Fields, p. 206, for another reference to this

        saying.)


Footnote 59:
(return)
Hégashi is the causative form of the verb

        hégu, "to pull off," "peel off," "strip off," "split

        off." The term Fuda-hégashi signifies

        "Make-peel-off-august-charm Ghost." In my Ghostly

        Japan the reader can find a good Japanese story about a

        Fuda-hégashi.


Footnote 60:
(return)
The fourth line gives these two readings:—
Nam'mai da?—"How many sheets are

        there?"
Nam[u] Aɯida!—"Hail, O Amitâbha!"
The invocation, Namu Amida Butsu, is chiefly used

        by members of the great Shin sect; but it is also used by

        other sects, and especially in praying for the dead. While

        repeating it, the person praying numbers the utterances

        upon his Buddhist rosary; and this custom is suggested by

        the use of the word kazoëté, "counting."


Footnote 61:
(return)
The word furu in the third line is made to do

        double duty,—as the adjective, furu[i],

        "ancient"; and as the verb furu, "to shake." The old

        term nama-kuhi (lit., "raw head") means a human

        head, freshly-severed, from which the blood is still

        oozing.


Footnote 62:
(return)
Two Japanese words are written, in kana, as

        "mé"—one meaning "a bud;" the other "eye." The

        syllables "hana" in like fashion, may signify either

        "flower" or "nose." As a grotesque, this little poem is

        decidedly successful.


Footnote 63:
(return)
Ayashigé is a noun formed from the adjective

        ayashi, "suspicious," "strange," "supernatural,"

        "doubtful." The word kagé signifies both "light" and

        "shadow,"—and is here used with double

        suggestiveness. The vegetable oil used in the old Japanese

        lamps used to be obtained from the nuts of the

        tsubaki. The reader should remember that the

        expression "ancient tsubaki" is equivalent to the

        expression "goblin-tsubaki,"—the tsubaki being

        supposed to turn into a goblin-tree only when it becomes

        old.


Footnote 64:
(return)
The tree-peony (botan) is here referred

        to,—a flower much esteemed in Japan. It is said to

        have been introduced from China during the eighth century;

        and no less than five hundred varieties of it are now

        cultivated by Japanese gardeners.

The Emperor Saimei reigned from 655 to 662 (A.D.); the

        Emperor Saga from 810 to 842.—Kudara was an ancient

        kingdom in southwestern Korea, frequently mentioned in

        early Japanese history.—A Naishinnō was

        of Imperial blood. In the ancient court-hierarchy there

        were twenty-five ranks or grades of noble

        ladies;—that of Naishinno was seventh in order

        of precedence.


Footnote 70:
(return)
For centuries the wives of the emperors and the ladies

        of the Imperial Court were chosen from the Fujiwara

        clan—The period called Hōgen lasted from 1156 to

        1159: the war referred to is the famous war between the

        Taira and Minamoto clans.


Footnote 71:
(return)
In old-time belief every lake or spring had its

        invisible guardian, supposed to sometimes take the form of

        a serpent or dragon. The spirit of a lake or pond was

        commonly spoken of as Iké-no-Mushi, the Master of

        the Lake. Here we find the title "Master" given to a dragon

        living in a well; but the guardian of wells is really the

        god Suijin.

(return)
Shigéhira, after a brave fight in defense of the

        capital,—then held by the Taïra (or Héïké)

        party,—was surprised and routed by Yoshitsuné, leader

        of the Minamoto forces. A soldier named Iyénaga, who was a

        skilled archer, shot down Shigéhira's horse; and Shigéhira

        fell under the struggling animal. He cried to an attendant

        to bring another horse; but the man fled. Shigéhira was

        then captured by Iyénaga, and eventually given up to

        Yoritomo, head of the Minamoto clan, who caused him to be

        sent in a cage to Kamakura. There, after sundry

        humiliations, he was treated for a time with

        consideration,—having been able, by a Chinese poem,

        to touch even the cruel heart of Yoritomo. But in the

        following year he was executed by request of the Buddhist

        priests of Nanto, against whom he had formerly waged war by

        order of Kiyomori.


Footnote 75:
