A VOYAGE OF CONSOLATION.

CHAPTER I.
It seems inexcusable to remind the public that one has written a book.

Poppa says I ought not to feel that way about it—that he might just as

well be shy about referring to the baking soda that he himself

invented—but I do, and it is with every apology that I mention it. I

once had such a good time in England that I printed my experiences, and

at the very end of the volume it seemed necessary to admit that I was

engaged to Mr. Arthur Greenleaf Page, of Yale College, Connecticut. I

remember thinking this was indiscreet at the time, but I felt compelled

to bow to the requirements of fiction. I was my own heroine, and I had

to be disposed of. There seemed to be no alternative. I did not wish to

marry Mr. Mafferton, even for literary purposes, and Peter Corke's

suggestion, that I should cast myself overboard in mid-ocean at the mere

idea of living anywhere out of England for the future, was

autobiographically impossible even if I had felt so inclined. So I

committed the indiscretion. In order that the world might be assured

that my heroine married and lived happily ever afterwards, I took it

prematurely into my confidence regarding my intention. The thing that

occurred, as naturally and inevitably as the rain if you leave your

umbrella at home, was that within a fortnight after my return to Chicago

my engagement to Mr. Page terminated; and the even more painful

consequence is that I feel obliged on that account to refer to it again.
Even an American man has his lapses into unreasonableness. Arthur

especially encouraged the idea of my going to England on the ground that

it would be so formative. He said that to gaze upon the headsman's block

in the Tower was in itself a liberal education. As we sat together in

the drawing-room—momma and poppa always preferred the sitting-room when

Arthur was there—he used to gild all our future with the culture which

I should acquire by actual contact with the hoary traditions of Great

Britain. He advised me earnestly to disembark at Liverpool in a

receptive and appreciative, rather than a critical and antagonistic,

state of mind, to endeavour to assimilate all that was worth

assimilating over there, remembering that this might give me as much as

I wanted to do in the time. I remember he expressed himself rather

finely about the only proper attitude for Americans visiting England

being that of magnanimity, and about the claims of kinship, only once

removed, to our forbearance and affection. He put me on my guard, so to

speak, about only one thing, and that was spelling. American spelling,

he said, had become national, and attachment to it ranked next to

patriotism. Such words as "color," "program," "center," had obsolete

English forms which I could only acquire at the sacrifice of my

independence, and the surrender of my birthright to make such

improvements upon the common language as I thought desirable. And I know

that I was at some inconvenience to mention "color," "program," and

"center," in several of my letters just to assure Mr. Page that my

orthography was not in the least likely to be undermined.
Indeed, I took his advice at every point. I hope I do not presume in

asking you to remember that I did. I know I was receptive, even to penny

buns, and sometimes simply wild with appreciation. I found it as easy as

possible to subdue the critical spirit, even in connection with things

which I should never care to approve of. I shook hands with Lord

Mafferton without the slightest personal indignation with him for being

a peer, and remember thinking that if he had been a duke I should have

had just the same charity for him. Indeed, I was sorry, and am still

sorry, that during the four months I spent in England I didn't meet a

single duke. This is less surprising than it looks, as they are known to

be very scarce, and at least a quarter of a million Americans visit

Great Britain every year; but I should like to have known one or two. As

it was, four or five knights—knights are very thick—one baronet, Lord

Mafferton, one marquis—but we had no conversation—one colonel of

militia, one Lord Mayor, and a Horse Guard, rank unknown, comprise my

acquaintance with the aristocracy. A duke or so would have completed the

set. And the magnanimity which I would so willingly have stretched to

include a duke spread itself over other British institutions as amply as

Arthur could have wished. When I saw things in Hyde Park on Sunday that

I was compelled to find excuses for, I thought of the tyrant's iron

heel; and when I was obliged to overlook the superiorities of the titled

great, I reflected upon the difficulty of walking in iron heels without

inconveniencing a prostrate population. I should defy anybody to be more

magnanimous than I was.
As to the claims of kinship, only once removed, to our forbearance and

affection, I never so much as sat out a dance on a staircase with Oddie

Pratte without recognising them.
It seems almost incredible that Arthur should not have been gratified,

but the fact remains that he was not. Anyone could see, after the first

half hour, that he was not. During the first half hour it is, of course,

impossible to notice anything. We had sunk to the level of generalities

when I happened to mention Oddie.
"He had darker hair than you have, dear," I said, "and his eyes were

blue. Not sky blue, or china blue, but a kind of sea blue on a cloudy

day. He had rather good eyes," I added reminiscently.
"Had he?" said Arthur.
"But your noses," I went on reassuringly, "were not to be compared with

each other."
"Oh!" said Arthur.
"He was so impulsive!" I couldn't help smiling a little at the

recollection. "But for that matter they all were."
"Impulsive?" asked Arthur.
"Yes. Ridiculously so. They thought as little of proposing as of asking

one to dance."
"Ah!" said Arthur.
"Of course, I never accepted any of them, even for a moment. But they

had such a way of taking things for granted. Why one man actually

thought I was engaged to him!"
"Really!" said Arthur. "May I inquire——"
"No, dear," I replied, "I think not. I couldn't tell anybody about

it—for his sake. It was all a silly mistake. Some of them," I added

thoughtfully, "were very stupid."
"Judging from the specimens that find their way over here," Arthur

remarked, "I should say there was plenty of room in their heads for

their brains."
Arthur was sitting on the other side of the fireplace, and by this time

his expression was aggressive. I thought his remark unnecessarily

caustic, but I did not challenge it.
"Some of them were stupid," I repeated, "but they were nearly all

nice." And I went on to say that what Chicago people as a whole thought

about it I didn't know and I didn't care, but so far as my experience

went the English were the loveliest nation in the world.
"A nation like a box of strawberries," Mr. Page suggested, "all the big

ones on top, all the little ones at the bottom."
"That doesn't matter to us," I replied cheerfully, "we never get any

further than the top. And you'll admit there's a great tendency for

little ones to shake down. It's only a question of time. They've had so

much time in England. You see the effects of it everywhere."
"Not at all. By no means. Our little strawberries rise," he declared.
"Do they? Dear me, so they do! I suppose the American law of gravity is

different. In England they would certainly smile at that."
Arthur said nothing, but his whole bearing expressed a contempt for

puns.
"Of course," I said, "I mean the loveliest nation after Americans."
I thought he might have taken that for granted. Instead, he looked

incredulous and smiled, in an observing, superior way.
"Why do you say 'ahfter'?" he asked. His tone was sweetly acidulated.
"Why do you say 'affter'?" I replied simply.
"Because," he answered with quite unnecessary emphasis, "in the part of

the world I come from everybody says it. Because my mother has brought

me up to say it."
"Oh," I said, looking at the lamp, "they say it like that in other parts

of the world too. In Yorkshire—and such places. As far as mothers go,

I must tell you that momma approves of my pronunciation. She likes it

better than anything else I have brought back with me—even my

tailor-mades—and thinks it wonderful that I should have acquired it in

the time."
"Don't you think you could remember a little of your good old American?

Doesn't it seem to come back to you?"
All the Wicks hate sarcasm, especially from those they love, and I

certainly had not outgrown my fondness for Mr. Page at this time.
"It all came back to me, my dear Arthur," I said, "the moment you opened

your lips!"
At that not only Mr. Page's features and his shirt front, but his whole

personality seemed to stiffen. He sat up and made an outward movement on

the seat of his chair which signified, "My hat and overcoat are in the

hall, and if you do not at once retract——"
"Rather than allow anything to issue from them which would imply that I

was not an American I would keep them closed for ever," he said.
"You needn't worry about that," I observed. "Nothing ever will. But I

don't know why we should glory in talking through our noses."

Involuntarily I played with my engagement ring, slipping it up and

down, as I spoke.
Arthur rose with an expression of tolerant amusement—entirely

forced—and stood by the fireplace. He stood beside it, with his elbow

on the mantelpiece, not in front of it with his legs apart, and I

thought with a pang how much more graceful the American attitude was.
"Have you come back to tell us that we talk through our noses?" he

asked.
"I don't like being called an Anglomaniac," I replied, dropping my ring

from one finger to another. Fortunately I was sitting in a rocking

chair—the only one I had not been able to persuade momma to have taken

out of the drawing-room. The rock was a considerable relief to my

nerves.
"I knew that the cockneys on the other side were fond of inventing

fictions about what they are pleased to call the 'American accent,'"

continued Mr. Page, with a scorn which I felt in the very heels of my

shoes, "but I confess I thought you too patriotic to be taken in by

them."
"Taken in by them" was hard to bear, but I thought if I said nothing at

this point we might still have a peaceful evening. So I kept silence.
"Of course, I speak as a mere product of the American Constitution—a

common unit of the democracy," he went on, his sentences gathering wrath

as he rolled them out, "but if there were such a thing as an American

accent, I think I've lived long enough, and patrolled this little Union

of ours extensively enough, to hear it by this time. But it appears to

be necessary to reside four months in England, mixing freely with earls

and countesses, to detect it."
"Perhaps it is," I said, and I may have smiled.
"I should hate to pay the price."
Mr. Page's tone distinctly expressed that the society of earls and

countesses would be, to him, contaminating.
Again I made no reply. I wanted the American accent to drop out of the

conversation, if possible, but Fate had willed it otherwise.
"I sai, y'know, awfly hard luck, you're havin' to settle down amongst

these barbarians again, bai Jove!"
I am not quite sure that it's a proper term for use in a book, but by

this time I was mad. There was criticism in my voice, and a distinct

chill as I said composedly, "You don't do it very well."
I did not look at him, I looked at the lamp, but there was that in the

air which convinced me that we had arrived at a crisis.
"I suppose not. I'm not a marquis, nor the end man at a minstrel show.

I'm only an American, like sixty million other Americans, and the

language of Abraham Lincoln is good enough for me. But I suppose I, like

the other sixty million, emit it through my nose!"
"I should be sorry to contradict you," I said.
Arthur folded his arms and gathered himself up until he appeared to

taper from his stem like a florist's bouquet, and all the upper part of

him was pink and trembling with emotion. Arthur may one day attain

corpulence; he is already well rounded.
"I need hardly say," he said majestically, "that when I did myself the

honour of proposing, I was under the impression that I had a suitable

larynx to offer you."
"You see I didn't know," I murmured, and by accident I dropped my

engagement ring, which rolled upon the carpet at his feet. He stooped

and picked it up.
"Shall I take this with me?" he asked, and I said "By all means."
That was all.
I gave ten minutes to reflection and to the possibility of Arthur's

coming back and pleading, on his knees, to be allowed to restore that

defective larynx. Then I went straight upstairs to the telephone and

rang up the Central office. When they replied "Hello," I said, in the

moderate and concentrated tone which we all use through telephones, "Can

you give me New York?"
Poppa was in New York, and in an emergency poppa and I always turn to

one another. There was a delay, during which I listened attentively,

with one eye closed—I believe it is the sign of an unbalanced intellect

to shut one eye when you use the telephone, but I needn't go into

that—and presently I got New York. In a few minutes more I was

accommodated with the Fifth Avenue Hotel.
"Mr. T.P. Wick, of Chicago," I demanded.
"Is his room number Sixty-two?"
That is the kind of mind which you usually find attached to the New York

end of a trans-American telephone. But one does not bandy words across a

thousand miles of country with a hotel clerk, so I merely responded:
"Very probably."
There was a pause, and then the still small voice came again.
"Mr. Wick is in bed at present. Anything important?"
I reflected that while I in Chicago was speaking to the hotel clerk at

half-past nine o'clock, the hotel clerk in New York was speaking to me

at eleven. This in itself was enough to make our conversation

disjointed.
"Yes," I responded, "it is important. Ask Mr. Wick to get out of bed."
Sufficient time elapsed to enable poppa to put on his clothes and come

down by the elevator, and then I heard:
"Mr. Wick is now speaking."
"Yes, poppa," I replied, "I guess you are. Your old American accent

comes singing across in a way that no member of your family would ever

mistake. But you needn't be stiff about it. Sorry to disturb you."
Poppa and I were often personal in our intercourse. I had not the

slightest hesitation in mentioning his American accent.
"Hello, Mamie! Don't mention it. What's up? House on fire? Water pipes

burst? Strike in the kitchen? Sound the alarm—send for the

plumber—raise Gladys's wages and sack Marguerite."
"My engagement to Mr. Page is broken. Do you get me? What do you

suggest?"
I heard a whistle, which I cannot express in italics, and then,

confidentially:
"You don't say so! Bad break?"
"Very," I responded firmly.
"Any details of the disaster available? What?"
"Not at present," I replied, for it would have been difficult to send

them by telephone.
I could hear poppa considering the matter at the other end. He coughed

once or twice and made some indistinct inquiries of the hotel clerk.

Then he called my attention again.
"Hello!" he said. "On to me? All right. Go abroad. Always done.

Paris, Venice, Florence, Rome, and the other places. I'll stand in.

Germanic sails Wednesdays. Start by night train to-morrow. Bring momma.

We can get Germanic in good shape and ten minutes to spare. Right?"
"Right," I responded, and hung up the handle. I did not wish to keep

poppa out of bed any longer than was necessary, he was already up so

much later than I was. I turned away from the instrument to go down

stairs again, and there, immediately behind me, stood momma.
"Well, really!" I exclaimed. It did not occur to me that the privacy of

telephonic communication between Chicago and New York was not

inviolable. Besides, there are moments when one feels a little annoyed

with one's momma for having so lightly undertaken one's existence. This

was one of them. But I decided not to express it.
"I was only going to say," I remarked, "that if I had shrieked it would

have been your fault."
"I knew everything," said momma, "the minute I heard him shut the gate.

I came up immediately, and all this time, dear, you've been confiding in

us both. My dear daughter."
Momma carries about with her a well-spring of sentiment, which she did

not bequeath to me. In that respect I take almost entirely after my

other parent.
"Very well," I said, "then I won't have to do it again."
Her look of disappointment compelled me to speak with decision. "I know

what you would like at this juncture, momma. You'd like me to get down

on the floor and put my head in your lap and weep all over your new

brocade. That's what you'd really enjoy. But, under circumstances like

these, I never do things like that. Now the question is, can you get

ready to start for Europe to-morrow night, or have you a headache coming

on?"
Momma said that she expected Mrs. Judge Simmons to tea to-morrow

afternoon, that she hadn't been thinking of it, and that she was out of

nerve tincture. At least, these were her principal objections. I said,

on mature consideration, I didn't see why Mrs. Simmons shouldn't come to

tea, that there were twenty-four hours for all necessary thinking, and

that a gallon of nerve tincture, if required, could be at her disposal

in ten minutes.
"Being Protestants," I added, "I suppose a convent wouldn't be of any

use to us—what do you think?"
Momma thought she could go.
There was no need for hurry, and I attended to only one other matter

before I went to bed. That was a communication to the Herald, which I

sent off in plenty of time to appear in the morning. It was addressed to

the Society Editor, and ran as follows:
"The marriage arranged between Professor Arthur Greenleaf Page, of Yale

University, and Miss Mamie Wick, of 1453, Lakeside-avenue, Chicago, will

not take place. Mr. and Mrs. Wick, and Miss Wick, sail for Europe on

Wednesday by s.s. Germanic."
I reflected, as I closed my eyes, that Arthur was a regular reader of

the Herald.

CHAPTER II.
We met poppa on the Germanic gangway, his hat on the back of his head

and one finger in each of his waistcoat pockets, an attitude which, with

him, always betokens concern. The vessel was at that stage of departure

when the people who have been turned off are feeling injured that it

should have been done so soon, and apparently only the weight of poppa's

personality on its New York end kept the gangway out. As we drove up he

appeared to lift his little finger and three dishevelled navigators

darted upon the cab. They and we and our trunks swept up the gangway

together, which immediately closed behind us, under the direction of an

extremely irritated looking Chief Officer. We reunited as a family as

well as we could in connection with uncoiled ropes and ship discipline.

Then poppa, with his watch in his hand, exclaimed reproachfully, well in

hearing of the Chief Officer, "I gave you ten minutes and you had ten

minutes. You stopped at Huyler's for candy, I'll lay my last depreciated

dollar on it."
My other parent looked guiltily at some oblong boxes tied up in white

paper with narrow red ribbon, which, innocently enough I consider,

enhance the value of life to us both. But she ignored the charge—momma

hates arguments.
"Dear me!" she said, as the space widened between us and the docks. "So

we are all going to Europe together this morning! I can hardly realise

it. Farewell America! How interesting life is."
"Yes," replied poppa. "And now I guess I'd better show you your cabins

before it gets any more interesting."
We had a calm evening, though nothing would induce momma to think so,

and at ten o'clock Senator J.P. Wick and I were still pacing the deck

talking business. The moon rose, and threw Arthur's shadow across our

conversation, but we looked at it with precision and it moved away. That

is one of poppa's most comforting characteristics, he would as soon open

his bosom to a shot-gun as to a confidence. He asked for details through

the telephone merely for bravado. As a matter of fact, if I had begun to

send them he would have rung off the connection and said it was an

accident. We dipped into politics, and I told the Senator that while I

considered his speech on the Silver Compromise a credit to the family on

the whole, I thought he had let himself out somewhat unnecessarily at

the expense of the British nation.
"We are always twisting a tail," I said reproachfully, "that does

nothing but wag at us."
This poppa reluctantly admitted with the usual reference to the Irish

vote. We both hoped sincerely that any English friends who saw that

speech, and paused to realise that the orator was a parent of mine,

would consider the number of Irish resident in Illinois, and the amount

of invective which their feelings require. Poppa doesn't really know

sometimes whether he is himself or a shillelagh, but whatever his

temporary political capacity he is never ungrateful. He went on to give

me the particulars of his interview with the President about the Chicago

Post Office, and then I gradually unfolded my intention of preparing our

foreign experiences as a family for publication in book form. While I

was unfolding it poppa eyed me askance.
"Is that usual?" he inquired.
"Very usual indeed," I replied.
"I mean—under the circumstances?"
"Under what circumstances?" I demanded boldly. I knew that nothing would

induce him to specify them.
"Oh, I only meant—it wasn't exactly my idea."
"What was your idea—exactly?" It was mean of me to put poppa to the

blush, but I had to define the situation.
"Oh," said he, with unlooked-for heroism, "I was basing my calculations

with reference to you on the distractions of change—Paris dry-goods,

rowing round Venice in gondolas, riding through the St. Gothard tunnel,

and the healing hand of time. I don't intend to give a day less than six

weeks to it. I'm looking forward to the tranquilising effect of the

antique some myself," he added, hedging. "I find these new self-risers

that we've undertaken to carry almost more than my temperament can

stand. They went up from an output of five hundred dollars to six

hundred and fifty thousand, and back again inside seven days last month.

I'm looking forward to examining something that hasn't moved for a

couple of thousand years with considerable pleasure."
"Poppa," said I, ignoring the self-risers, "if you were as particular

about the quality of your fiction as you are about the quality of your

table-butter, you would know that the best heroines never have recourse

to such measures now. They are simply obsolete. Except for my literary

intention, I should be ashamed to go to Europe at all—under the

circumstances. But that, you see, brings the situation up to date. I

transmit my European impressions through the prism of damaged affection.

Nothing could be more modern."
"I see," replied poppa, rubbing his chin searchingly, which is his

manner of expressing sagacious doubt. His beard descends from the lower

part of his chin in the long unfettered American manner, without which

it is impossible for Punch to indicate a citizen of the United States.

When he positively disapproves he pulls it severely.
"But Europe's been done before, you know," he continued. "In fact, I

don't know any continent more popular than Europe with people that want

to publish books of travel. It's been done before."
"Never," I rejoined, "in connection with you, poppa!"
Poppa removed his hand from his chin.
"Oh, if I'm to assist, that's quite another anecdote," he said briskly.

"I didn't understand you intended to ring me in. Of course, I don't mean

to imply there is any special prejudice against books of travel in

Europe. About how many pages did you think of running it to?"
"My idea was three hundred," I replied.
"And how many words to a page?"
"Two hundred and fifty—more or less."
"That's seventy-five thousand words! Pretty big undertaking, if you look

at it in bulk."
"We shall have to rely upon momma," I remarked.
Poppa's expression disparaged the idea, and he began to feel round for

his beard.
"If I were you," he said, "I wouldn't place much dependence on momma.

She'll be able to give you a few hints on sunsets and a pointer or two

about the various Venuses, likely—she's had photographs of several of

them in the house for years—but I expect it's going to be a question of

historical fact pretty often, and momma won't be in it. Not that I want

to choke momma off," he continued, "but she will necessitate a whole

reference library. And in some parts of Europe I believe they charge you

for every pound of luggage, including your lunch, if you don't happen to

have concealed it in your person."
"We'll have to pin her down to the guide-books," I remarked.
"That depends. I've always understood that the guide-book market was

largely controlled by Mr. Murray and Mr. Baedeker. Also, that Mr. Murray

writes in a vein of pretty lofty sentiment, while Mr. Baedeker is about

as interesting as a directory. Now where the right emotion is included

at the price I don't see the use of momma, but when it's a question of

Baedeker we might turn her on. See?"
"Poppa," I replied with emotion, "you will both be invaluable. I will

bid you good-night. I believe the electric light burns all night long in

the smoking-cabin, but that is not supposed to indicate that gentlemen

are expected to stay there till dawn. I see you have two Havanas left.

That will be quite enough for one evening. Good-night, poppa."

CHAPTER III.
All the way across momma implored me to become reconciled to Arthur. In

extreme moments, when it was very choppy, she composed telegrams on

lines which were to drive him wild with contrition without compromising

my dignity; and when I suggested the difficulty of tampering with the

Atlantic cable in mid-ocean without a diving machine, she wept, hinting

that, if I were a true daughter of hers, things would never have come to

such a pass. My position, from a filial point of view, was most trying.

I could not deny my responsibility for momma's woes—she never left her

cabin—yet I was powerless to put an end to them. Young women in novels

have thrown themselves into the arms of the wrong man under far less

parental pressure, but although it was indeed the hour the man was not

available. Neither, such was the irony of circumstances, would our

immediate union have affected the motion in the slightest degree. But

although I presented these considerations to momma many times a day, she

adhered so persistently to the idea of promoting a happy reunion that I

was obliged to keep a very careful eye on the possibility of

surreptitious messages from Liverpool. Once on dry land, however, momma

saw her duty in another light. I might say that she swallowed her

principles with the first meal she really enjoyed, after which she

expressed her conviction that it was best to let the dead past bury its

dead, so long as the obsequies did not necessitate her immediate return

to America.
I was looking forward immensely to observing the Senator in London,

remembering the effect it had upon my own imagination, but on our

arrival he conducted himself in a manner which can only be described as

non-committal. He went about with his hands in his pockets, smoking

large cigars with an air of reserved criticism that vastly impressed the

waiters, acquiescing in strawberry jam for breakfast, for example, in a

manner which said that, although this might be to him a new and complex

custom, he was acquainted with Chicago ones much more recondite. His air

was superior, but modestly so, and if he said nothing you would never

suppose it was because he had nothing to say. He meant to give Great

Britain a chance before he pronounced anything distinctly unfavourable

even to her steaks, and in the meantime to remember what an up-to-date

American owes to his country's reputation in the hotels of a foreign

town.
He was very much at his ease, and I saw him looking at a couple of just

introduced Englishmen embarking in conversation, as if he wondered what

could possibly be the matter with them. I am sorry that I can't say as

much for my other parent, but before monarchical institutions momma

weakened. She had moments of terrible indecision as to how to do her

hair, and I am certain it was not a matter of indifference to her that

she should make a good impression upon the head butler. Also, she

hesitated about examining the mounted Guardsman on duty at Whitehall,

preferring to walk past with a casual glance, as if she were accustomed

to see things quite as wonderful every day at home, whereas nothing to

approach it has ever existed in America, except in the imagination of

Mr. Barnum, and he is dead. And shopwalkers patronised her. I

congratulated myself sometimes that I was there to assert her dignity.
I must be permitted to generalise in this way about our London

experiences because they only lasted a day and a half, and it is

impossible to get many particulars into that space. It was really a pity

we had so little time. Nothing would have been more interesting than to

bring momma into contact with the Poets' Corner, or introduce poppa to

the House of Lords, and watch the effect. I am sure, from what I know of

my parents, that the effect would have been crisp. But we decided that

six weeks was not too much to give to the Continent, also that an

opportunity, six weeks long, of absorbing Europe is not likely to occur

twice in the average American lifetime. We stayed over two or three

trains in London, however, just long enough to get in a background, as

it were, for our Continental experiences. The weather was typical, and

the background, from an artistic point of view, was perfect. While not

precisely opaque, you couldn't see through it anywhere.
When it became a question of how we were to put in the time, it seemed

to momma as if she would rather lie down than anything.
"You and your father, dear," she said, "might drive to St. Paul's, when

it stops raining. Have a good look at the dome and try to bring me back

the sound of the echo. It is said to be very weird. See that poppa

doesn't forget to take off his hat in the body of the church, but he

might put it on in the Whispering Gallery, where it is sure to be

draughty. And remember that the funeral coach of the Duke of Wellington

is down in the crypt, darling. You might bring me an impression of that.

I think I'll have a cup of chocolate and try to get a little sleep."
"Is it," asked poppa, "the coach which the Duke sent to represent him at

the other people's funerals, or the one in which he attended his own?"
"You can look that up," momma replied; "but my belief is that it was

presented to the Duke by a grateful nation after his demise. In which

case he couldn't possibly have used it more than once."
I looked at momma reprovingly, but, seeing that she had no suspicion of

being humorous, I said nothing. The Senator pushed out his under lip and

pulled his beard.
"I don't know about St. Paul's," he said; "wouldn't any other

impression do as well, momma? It doesn't seem to be just the weather for

crypts, and I don't suppose the hearse of a military man is going to

make the surroundings any more cheerful. Now, my idea is that when time

is limited you've got to let some things go. I'd let the historical go

every time. I'd let the instructive go—we can't drag around an idea of

the British Museum, for instance. I'd let ancient associations

go—unless you're particularly interested in the parties associated."
I thought of the morning I once spent picking up details, traditions,

and remains of Dr. Johnson in various parts of the West Central

district, and privately sympathised with this view, though I felt

compelled to look severe. Momma, who was now lying down, dissented.

What, then, she demanded, had we crossed the ocean for?
"Rather," said she, "where time is limited let us spread ourselves, so

to speak, over the area of culture available. This morning, for example,

you, husband, might ramble round the Tower and try to picture the

various tragedies that have been enacted there. You, daughter, might go

and bring us those impressions from St. Paul's, while I will content

myself with observing the manners of the British chambermaid. So far, I

must say, I think they are lovely. Thus, each doing what he can and she

can, we shall take back with us, as a family, more real benefit than we

could possibly obtain if we all derived it from the same source."
"No," said poppa firmly. "I take exception to your theory right there,

Augusta. Culture is a very harmless thing, and there's no reason why you

shouldn't take it in, till your back gives out, every day we're here.

But I consider that we've got the article in very good shape in our

little town over there in Illinois, and personally I don't propose to go

nosing round after it in Europe. And as a family man I should hate to be

divided up for any such purpose."
"Oh, if you're going to steel yourself against it, my love——"
"Now, what Bramley said to me the day before we sailed was this—No, I'm

not steeling myself against it; my every pore is open to it—Bramley

said: 'Your time is limited, you can't see everything. Very well. See

the unique. Keep that in mind,' he said; 'the unique. And you'll be

surprised to find how very little there is in the world, outside

Chicago, that is unique.'"
"Applying that rule," continued the Senator, strolling up and down, "the

things to see in London are the Crystal Palace and the Albert Memorial.

Especially the Albert Memorial. That was a man who played second fiddle

to his wife, and enjoyed it, all his life long; and there he sits in

Hyde Park to-day, I understand, still receiving the respectful homage of

the nation—the only case on record."
"Westminster Abbey would be much better for you," said momma.
"Don't you think," I put in, "that if momma is to get any sleep——"
"Certainly. Now, another thing that Bramley said was, 'Look here,' he

said, 'remember the Unattainable Elsewhere—and get it. You're likely to

be in London. Now the Unattainable Elsewhere, for that town, is

gentlemen's suitings. For style, price, and quality of goods the London

tailor leads the known universe. Wick,' he said—he was terribly in

earnest—'if you have one hour in London, leave your measure!'"
"In that case," said momma, sitting up and ascertaining the condition of

her hair, "you would like me to be with you, love."
Now, if momma doesn't like poppa's clothes, she always gives them away

without telling him. This would be thought arbitrary in England, and I

have certainly known the Senator suddenly reduced to great destitution

through it, but America is a free country, and there is no law to compel

us to see our male relations unbecomingly clad against our will.
"Well, to tell the truth, Augusta," said poppa, "I would. I'd like to

get this measure through by a unanimous vote. It will save complications

afterwards. But are you sure you wouldn't rather lie down?"
Momma replied to the effect that she wouldn't mind his going anywhere

else alone, but this was important. She put her gloves on as she spoke,

and her manner expressed that she was equal to any personal sacrifice

for the end in view.
Colonel Bramley had given the Senator a sartorial address of repute,

and presently the hansom drew up before it, in Piccadilly. We went about

as a family in one hansom for sociability.
"Look here, driver," said poppa through the roof, "have we got there?"
The cabman, in a dramatic and resentful manner, pointed out the number

with his whip.
"There's the address as was given to me, sir."
"Well, there's nothing to get mad about," said poppa sternly. "I'm

looking for Marcus Trippit, tailor and outfitter."
"It's all right, sir. All on the brass plite on the door, sir. I can see

it puffickly from 'ere."
The cabman seemed appeased, but his tone was still remonstrative.
We all looked at the door with the brass plate. It was flanked on one

side by the offices of a house agent, on the other by a superior looking

restaurant.
"There isn't the sign of a tailor about the premises," said poppa,

"except his name. I don't like the look of that."
"Perhaps," suggested momma, "it's his private address."
"Well, I guess we don't want to call on Marcus, especially as we've got

no proper introduction. Driver, that isn't Mr. Trippit's place of

business. It's his home."
We all craned up at the hole in the roof at once, like young birds, and

we all distinctly saw the driver smile.
"No, sir, I don't think 'e'd put it up like that that 'e was a tyler,

not on 'is privit residence, sir. I think you'll find the business

premises on the fust or second floor, likely."
"Where's his window?" the Senator demanded. "Where's his display? No, I

don't think Marcus will do for me. I'm not confiding enough. Now, you

don't happen to be able to recommend a tailor, do you?"
"Yes, sir, I can take you to a gentleman that'll turn you out as

'andsome as need be. Out 'Ampstead way, 'e is."
The Senator smiled. "About a three-and-sixpenny fare, eh?" he said.
"Yes, sir, all of that."
"I thought so. I don't mind the three and sixpence. You can't do much

driving where I come from under a dollar; but we've only got about

twenty-four hours for the British capital altogether, and I can't spare

the time."
"Suppose he drives along slowly," suggested momma.
"Just so. Drive along slowly until you come to a tailor that has a shop,

do you see? And a good-sized window, with waxwork figures in it to show

off the goods. Then let me hear from you again."
The man's expression changed to one of cheerfulness and benignity.

"Right you are, sir," he said, and shut down the door in a manner that

suggested entire appreciation of the circumstances.
"I think we can trust him," said poppa. Inside, therefore, we gave

ourselves up to enjoyment of what momma called the varied panorama

around us; while, outside, the cabman passed in critical review half the

gentleman's outfitters in London. It was momma who finally brought him

to a halt, and the establishment which inspired her with confidence and

emulation was inscribed in neat, white enamelled letters, Court

Tailors.
As we entered, a person of serious appearance came forward from the

rear, by no means eagerly or inquiringly, but with a grave step and a

great deal of deportment. I fancy he looked at momma and me with slight

surprise; then, with his hands calmly folded and his head a little on

one side, he gave his attention to the Senator. But it was momma who

broke the silence.
"We wish," said momma, "to look at gentlemen's suitings."
"Yes, madam, certainly. Is it for—for——." He hesitated in the

embarrassed way only affected in the very best class of establishments,

and I felt at ease at once as to the probable result.
"For this gentleman," said momma, with a wave of her hand.
The Senator, being indicated, acknowledged it. "Yes," he said, "I'm your

subject. But there's just one thing I want to say. I haven't got any use

for a Court suit, because where I live we haven't got any use for

Courts. My idea would be something aristocratic in quality but

democratic in cut—the sort of thing you would make up for a member of

Mr. Gladstone's family. Do I make myself clear?"
"Certainly, sir. Ordinary morning dress, sir, or is it evening dress, or

both? Will you kindly step this way, sir?"
"We will all step this way," said momma.
"It would be a morning coat and waistcoat then, sir, would it not? And

trousers of a different—somewhat lighter——"
"Well, no," the Senator replied. "Something I could wear around pretty

much all day."
My calm regard forbade the gentleman's outfitter to smile, even in the

back of his head.
"I think I understand, sir. Now, here is something that is being a good

deal worn just now. Beautiful finish."
"Nothing brownish, thank you," said momma, with decision.
"No, madam? Then perhaps you would prefer this, sir. More on the iron

gray, sir."
"That would certainly be more becoming," said momma. "And I like that

invisible line. But it's rather too woolly. I'm afraid it wouldn't keep

its appearance. What do you think, Mamie?"
"Oh, there's no woolliness, madam." The gentleman's outfitter's tone

implied that wool was the last thing he would care to have anything to

do with. "It's the nap. And as to the appearance of these goods"—he

smiled slightly—"well, we put our reputation on them, that's all. I

can't say more than that. But I have the same thing in a smooth finish,

if you would prefer it."
"I think I would prefer it. Wouldn't you, Mamie?"
The man brought the same thing in a smooth finish, and looked

interrogatively at poppa.
"Oh, I prefer it, too," said he, with a profound assumption of

intelligent interest. "Were you thinking of having the pants made of the

same material, Augusta?"
The gentleman's outfitter suddenly turned his back, and stood thus for

an instant struggling with something like a spasm. Knowing that if

there's one thing in the world momma hates it's the exhibition of

poppa's sense of humour, I walked to the door. When I came back they

were measuring the Senator.
"Will you have the American shoulder, sir? Most of our customers prefer

it."
"Well, no. The English shoulder would be more of a novelty on me. You

see I come from the United States myself."
"Do you indeed, sir?"
The manners of some tailors might be emulated in England.
"Tails are a little longer than they were, sir, and waistcoats cut a

trifle higher. Not more than half an inch in both cases, sir, but it

does make a difference. Now, with reference to the coat, sir; will you

have it finished with braid or not? Silk braid, of course, sir."
"Augusta?" demanded the Senator.
"Is braid de nouveau?" asked momma.
"Not precisely, madam, but the Prince certainly has worn it this season

while he didn't last."
"Do you refer to Wales?" asked poppa.
"Yes, sir. He's very generally mentioned simply as 'The Prince.' His

Royal Highness is very conservative, so to speak, about such things, so

when he takes up a style we generally count on its lasting at least

through one season. I can assure you, sir, the Prince has appeared in

braid. You needn't be afraid to order it."
"I think," put in momma, "that braid would make a very neat finish,

love."
Poppa walked slowly towards the door, considering the matter. With his

hand on the knob he turned round.
"No," he said, "I don't think that's reason enough for me. We're both

men in public positions, but I've got nothing in common with Wales. I'll

have a plain hem."

CHAPTER IV.
"If there's one thing I hate," said Senator Wick several times in the

discussion of our plans, "it's to see a citizen of the United States

going round advertising himself. If you analyse it, it's a mean thing to

do, for it's no more a virtue to be born American than a fault to be

born anything else. I'm proud of my nationality and my income is a

source of satisfaction to me, but I don't intend to brandish either of

them in the face of Europe."
It was this principle that had induced poppa to buy tourist tickets

second class by rail, first class by steamer, all through, like ordinary

English people on eight or nine hundred a year. Momma and I thought it

rather noble of him and resolved to live up to it if possible, but when

he brought forth a large packet of hotel coupons, guaranteed to produce

everything, including the deepest respect of the proprietors, at ten

shillings and sixpence a day apiece, we thought he was making an

unnecessary sacrifice to the feelings of the non-American travelling

public.
"Two dollars and a half a day!" momma ejaculated. "Were there no more

expensive ones?"
"If there had been," poppa confessed, "I would have taken them. But

these were the best they had. And I understand it's a popular, sensible

way of travelling. I told the young man that the one thing we wished to

avoid was ostentation, and he said that these coupons would be a

complete protection."
"There must be some way of paying more," said momma pathetically,

looking at the paper books of tickets, held together by a quantity of

little holes. "Do they actually include everything?"
"Even wine, I understand, where it is the custom of the hotel to provide

it without extra charge, and in Switzerland honey with your breakfast,"

the Senator responded firmly. "I never made a more interesting purchase.

There before us lie our beds, breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, lights,

and attendance for the next six weeks."
"It is full of the most dramatic possibilities," I remarked, looking at

the packet.
"It seems to me a kind of attempt to coerce Providence," said momma, "as

much as to say, 'Whatever happens to the world, I am determined to have

my bed, breakfast, luncheon, dinner, lights, and attendance for six

weeks to come.' Is it not presumptuous?"
"It's very reasonable," said the Senator, "and that's the principal

thing you've got against it, Augusta. It's remarkably, pictorially

cheap." The Senator put the little books in their detachable cover,

snapped the elastic round them and restored the whole to his inside

pocket.
"You might almost say enjoyably cheap, if you know what I mean. The

inexpensiveness of Europe," he continued, "is going to be a great charm

for me. I intend to revel in it."
I am always discovering points about poppa the existence of which I had

not suspected. His appreciation of the joy of small prices had been

concealed in him up to this date, and I congratulated him warmly upon

its appearance. I believe it is inherent in primitive tribes and in all

Englishmen, but protective tariffs and other influences are rapidly

eradicating it in Americans, who should be condoled with on this point,

more than they usually are.
We were on our way to Paris after a miraculous escape of the Channel. So

calm it was that we had almost held our breaths in our anxiety lest the

wind should rise before we got over. Dieppe lay behind us, and momma at

the window declared that she could hardly believe she was looking out at

Normandy. Momma at the window was enjoying herself immensely in the

midst of Liberty silk travelling cushions, supported by her

smelling-bottle, and engaged apparently in the realisation of

long-cherished dreams.
"There they are in a row!" she exclaimed. "How lovely to see them

standing up in that stiff, unnatural way just as they do in the

pictures."
Poppa and I rushed raptly to the window, but discovered nothing

remarkable.
"To see what, Augusta?" demanded he.
"The Normandy poplars, love. Aren't you awfully disappointed in them?

I am. So wooden!"
Momma was enjoying herself.
Momma was enjoying herself.
Poppa said he didn't know that he had been relying much on the poplar

feature of the scenery, and returned to his weary search for American

telegrams in a London daily paper.
"Dear me," momma ejaculated, "I never supposed I should see them doing

it! And right along the line of the railway, too!"
"See them doing it!" I repeated, searching the landscape.
"The women working in the fields, darling love. Garnering the grain, all

in that nice moderate shade of blue-electric, shouldn't you call it?

There—there's another! No, you can't see her now. France is

fascinating!"
Poppa abruptly folded the newspaper. "I've learnt a great deal more than

I wanted to know about Madagascar," said he, "and I understand that

there's a likelihood of the London voter being called to arms to prevent

High Church trustees introducing candles and incense into the opening

exercises of the public schools. I've read eleven different accounts of

a battle in Korea, and an article on the fauna and flora of Beluchistan,

very well written. And I see it's stated, on good authority, that the

Queen drove out yesterday accompanied by the Princess Beatrice. I don't

know that I ever got more information for two cents in my life. But for

news—Great Scott! I know more news than there is in that paper! The

editor ought to be invited to come over and discover America."
"Here's something about America," I protested, "from Chicago, too. A

whole column—'Movements of Cereals.'"
"Yes, and look at that for a nice attractive headline," responded the

Senator with sarcasm. "'Movements of Cereals!' Gives you a great idea of

pace, doesn't it? Why couldn't they have called it 'Grain on the Go'?"
"Did Mr. McConnell get in for Mayor, or Jimmy Fagan?" I inquired,

looking down the column.
"They don't seem to have asked anybody."
"And who got the Post Office?"
"Not there, not there, my child!"
"Oh!" said momma at the window, "these little gray-stone villages are

too sweet for words. Why talk of Chicago? Mr. McConnell and Mr. Fagan

are all very well at home, but now that the ocean heaves between us, and

your political campaign is over, may we not forget them?"
"Forget Mike McConnell and Jimmy Fagan!" replied the Senator, regarding

a passing church spire with an absent smile. "Well, no, Augusta; as far

as I'm concerned I'm afraid it couldn't be done—at all permanently.

There's too much involved. But I see what you mean about turning the

mind out to pasture when the grazing is interesting—getting in a cud,

so to speak, for reflection afterwards. I see your idea."
The Senator is always business-like. He immediately addressed himself

through the other window to the appreciation of the scenery, and I felt,

as I took out my note-book to record one or two impressions, that he

would do it justice.
"No, momma," I was immediately compelled to exclaim, "you mustn't look

over my shoulder. It is paralysing to the imagination."
"Then I won't, dear. But oh, if you could only describe it as it is! The

ruined chateaux, tree-embosomed——" Momma paused.
"The gray church spires, from which at eventide the Angelus comes

pealing—or stealing," she continued. "Perhaps 'stealing' is better."
"Above all the poplars—the poplars are very characteristic, dear. And

the women toilers in the sunset fields garnering up the golden grain.

You might exclaim, 'Why are they always in blue?' Have you got that

down?"
"They were making hay," poppa corrected. "But I suppose the public won't

know the difference, any more than you did."
Momma leaned forward, clasping her smelling-bottle, and looked out of

the window with a smile of exaltation.
"The cows," she went on, "the proud-legged Norman cows standing

knee-deep in the quiet pools. Have you got the cows down, dear?"
The Senator, at the other window, looked across disparagingly, hard at

work on his beard. He said nothing, but after a time abruptly thrust his

hands in his pockets, and his feet out in front of him in a manner which

expressed absolute dissent. When momma said she thought she would try to

get a little sleep he looked round observantly, and as soon as her

slumber was sound and comfortable he beckoned to me.
"See here," he said, not unkindly, argumentatively. "About those cows.

In fact, about all these pointers your mother's been giving you. They're

all very nice and poetic—I don't want to run down momma's ideas—but

they don't strike me as original. I won't say I could put my finger on

it, but I'm perfectly certain I've heard of the poplars and the women

field labourers of Normandy somewhere before. She doesn't do it on

purpose"—the Senator inclined his head with deprecation toward the

sleeping form opposite, and lowered his voice—"and I don't know that

I'd mention it to you under any other circumstances, but momma's a

fearful plagiarist. She doesn't hesitate anywhere. I've known her do it

to William Shakespeare and the Book of Job, let alone modern authors. In

dealing with her suggestions you want to be very careful. Otherwise

momma'll get you into trouble."
I nodded with affectionate consideration. "I'll make a note of what you

say, Senator," I replied, and immediately, from motives of delicacy, we

changed the subject. As we talked, poppa told me in confidence how much

he expected of the democratic idea in Paris. He said that even the

short time we had spent in England was enough to enable him to detect

the subserviency of the lower classes there and to resent it, as a man

and a brother. He spoke sadly and somewhat bitterly of the manners of

the brother man who shaved him, which he found unjustifiably affable,

and of the inexcusable abasement of a British railway porter if you gave

him a shilling. He said he was glad to leave England, it was

demoralising to live there; you lost your sense of the dignity of

labour, and in the course of time you were almost bound to degenerate

into a swell. He expressed a good deal of sympathy with the aristocracy

on this account, concentrating his indignation upon those who, as it

were, made aristocrats of innocent human beings against their will. It

was more than he would have ventured to say in public, but in talking to

me poppa often mentions what a comfort it is to be his own mouthpiece.
"The best thing about these tourists' tickets is," said the Senator as

we approached Paris, "that they entitle you to the use of an

interpreter. He is said to be found on all station platforms of

importance, and I presume he's standing there waiting for us now. I take

it we're at liberty to tap his knowledge of the language in any moment

of difficulty just as if it were our own."
Ten minutes later the carriage doors were opening upon Paris, and the

Senator's eagle eye was searching the crowded platform for this

official. Our vague idea was that the interpreter would be a conspicuous

and permanent object like a nickle-in-the-slot machine, automatically

arranged to open his arms to tourists presenting the right tickets, and

emit conversation. When we finally detected him, by his cap, he was

shifting uneasily in the midst of a crowd of inquirers. His face was

pale, his beard pointed, his expression that of a person constantly

interrupted in many languages. The crowd was parting to permit him to

escape, when we filled up the available avenue and confronted him.
"Are you the linguist that goes with our tickets?" asked the Senator.
"I am ze interpretare yes, but weez ze tickets I go not, no. All-ways I

stay here in zis place, nowheres I go." He stood at bay, so to speak,

frowning fiercely as he replied, and then made another bolt for liberty,

but poppa laid a compelling hand upon his arm.
"If it's all the same to you," said poppa, firmly, "I've got ladies with

me, and——"
"Yes certainly you get presently your tronks. You see zat door beside

many people? Immediately it open you go and show ze customs man. You got

no duty thing, it is all right. You call one fiacre—carriage—and go at

your hotel."
"Oh," exclaimed momma, "is there any charge on nerve tincture, please?

It's entirely for my personal use."
"It's only on cigars and eau-de-Cologne, isn't it?" I entreated.
"Which door did you say?" asked the Senator. "I'd be obliged if you

would speak more slowly. There's no cause for excitement. From here I

can see fourteen doors, and I saw our luggage go in by this door."
"You don't believe wat I say! Very well! All ze same it is zat door

beside all ze people wat want zere tronks!"
"All right," said the Senator pacifically. "How you do boil over! I tell

you one thing, my friend," he added, as the interpreter washed his hands

of us, "you may be a necessity to the travelling public, but you're not

a luxury, in any sense of the word."

CHAPTER V.
The Senator, discovering to his surprise that the hotel clerk was a

lady, lifted his hat. He did not appear to be surprised, that wasn't the

Senator's way, but he forgot what he had to say, which proved it. While

he was hesitating she looked at him humorously and said "Good evening,

sir!" She was a florid person who wore this sense of humour between hard

blue eyes and an iron jaw. Momma took a passionate dislike to her on the

spot.
"Oh, then you do," said poppa. "You parlay Anglay. That's a good thing

I'm sure, for I know mighty little Fransay. May I ask what sort of

accommodation you can give Mrs. Wick, Miss Wick, and myself for

to-night? Anything on the first floor?"
"What rooms you require are one double one single, yes? Certainly.

Francois, trente-cinq et trente-huit." She handed Francois the keys

and her sense of humour disappeared in a smile which told poppa that he

might, if he liked, consider her a fine woman. He, wishing doubtless to

bask in it to the fullest extent, produced his book of tickets.
"I expect you've seen these before," he said, apparently for the

pleasure of continuing the conversation.
"I expect you've seen these before."
"I expect you've see these before."
As her eye fell upon them a look of startled cynicism suddenly replaced

the smile. Her cynicism was paradoxical, she was so large, and sound and

wholesome, and the more irritating on this account.
"You 'ave the coupons!" she exclaimed. "Ah-a-ah!" in a crescendo of

astonishment at our duplicity. "Then I 'ave made one mistake. Francois!

Those first floor rooms they are already taken. But on the third floor

are two good beautiful rooms. There is also the lift—you can use the

lift."
"I can't dispute with a lady," said poppa, "but that is singular. I

should prefer those first floor rooms which were not taken until I

mentioned the coupons."
"Sare!"
The lady's eye was unflinching, and poppa quailed. He looked ashamed, as

if he had been caught in telling a story. They made a picture, as he

stood there pulling his beard, of American chivalry and Gallic guile,

which was almost pathetic.
"Well," said he, "as it's necessary that Mrs. Wick should lie down as

soon as possible you might show us those third floor rooms."
Then he recovered his dignity and glanced at Madame more in sorrow than

in anger. "Certainly, sare," she said severely. "Will you use the lift?

For the lift there is no sharge."
"That," said the Senator, "is real liberal." In moments of emotion

poppa often dropped into an Americanism. "If it's a serious offer I

think we will use the lift."
At a nod from Madame, Francois went away to seek the man belonging to

the lift, and after a time returned with him. The lady produced another

key, with which the man belonging to the lift unlocked the door of the

brass cage which guarded it.
"You must find strangers very dishonest, madam," said the Senator

courteously as we stepped inside, "to render such a precaution

necessary."
But before we arrived at the third floor we were convinced that it was

unnecessary. It was not an elevator that the most burglarious would have

cared to take away.
So many Americans surrounded the breakfast table next morning that we

might almost have imagined ourselves in Chicago. A small, young priest

with furtive brown eyes cowered at one of the side tables, and at

another a broad-shouldered, unsmiling lady, dressed in black, with brows

and a slight moustache to match, dispensed food to a sallow and

shrinking object of preternaturally serious aspect who seemed to be her

husband, and a little boy who kept an anxious eye on them both. They

were French, too, but all the people who sat up and down the long middle

table belonged to the United States of America. They were there in

groups and in families representing different localities and different

social positions—as momma said, you had only to look at their shoulder

seams; and each group or family received the advances of the next with

the polite tolerance, head a little on one side, which characterises us

when we don't know each other's business standing or church membership;

but the tide of conversation which ebbed and flowed had a flavour which

made the table a geographical unit. I say "flavour," because there was

certainly something, but I am now inclined to think with Mr. Page that

"accent" is rather too strong a word to describe it. At all events, the

gratification of hearing it after his temporary exile in Great Britain

almost brought tears to the Senator's eyes. There were only three vacant

places, and, as we took them, making the national circle complete, a

little smile wavered round the table. It was a proud, conscious smile;

it indicated that though we might not be on terms of intimacy we

recognised ourselves to be immensely and uniformly American, and

considerably the biggest fraction of the travelling public. As poppa

said, the prevailing feeling was also American. As he was tucking his

napkin into his waistcoat, and ordering our various breakfasts, the

gentleman who sat next to him listened—he could not help it—fidgetted,

and finally, with some embarrassment, spoke.
"I don't know, sir," he said, "whether you're aware of it—I presume

you're a stranger, like myself—but all they allow for what they call

breakfast in this hotel is tea or coffee, rolls, and butter; everything

else is charged extra."
Poppa was touched. As he said to me afterward, who but an American

would have taken the trouble to tell a stranger a thing like that! Not

an Englishman, certainly—he would see you bankrupt first! He disguised

his own sophistication, and said he was very much obliged, and he almost

apologised for not being able to take advantage of the information, and

stick to coffee and rolls.
"But the fact is," he said in self-defence, "we may get back for lunch

and we may not."
"That's all right," the gentleman replied with distinct relief. "I

didn't mind the omelette or the sole, but when it came to fried chicken

and strawberries I just had to speak out. You going to make a long stay

in Paris?"
As they launched to conversation momma and I glanced at each other with

mutual congratulation. It was at last obvious that the Senator was going

to enjoy his European experiences; we had been a little doubtful about

it. Left to ourselves, we discussed our breakfast and the waiters, the

only French people we could see from where we sat, and expressed our

annoyance, which was great, at being offered tooth-picks. I was so

hungry that it was only when I asked for a third large roll that I

noticed momma regarding me with mild disapproval.
"I fear," she said with a little sigh, "that you are thinking very

little of what is past and gone, love."
"Momma," I replied, "don't spoil my breakfast." When momma can throw an

emotional chill over anything, I never knew her to refrain. "I should

like that garçon to bring me some more bread," I continued.
Momma sighed even more deeply. "You may have part of mine," she replied,

breaking it with a gesture that said such callousness she could not

understand. Her manner for the next few minutes expressed distinctly

that she, at least, meant to do her duty by Arthur.
Presently from the other side of poppa came the words, "Not Wick of

Chicago!"
"I guess I can't deny it," said poppa.
"Senator Wick?"
Poppa lowered his voice. "If it's all the same to you," he said, "not

for the present. Just plain Joshua P. Wick. I'm not what you call

travelling incognito, do you see, but, so far as the U.S. Senate is

concerned, I haven't got it with me."
"Well, sir, I won't mention it again. But all the same, if I may be

allowed to say so, I am pleased to meet you, sir—very pleased. I

suppose they wired you that Mike McConnell's got the Post Office."
Poppa held out his hand in an instant of speechless gratitude. "Sir," he

said, "they did not. Put it there. I said no wires and no letters, and

I've been sorry for it ever since. Momma," he continued, "daughter,

allow me to present to you Mr.?—Mr. Malt, who has heard by cablegram

that our friend Mr. McConnell is Postmaster-General of Chicago."
Momma was grateful, too, though she expressed it somewhat more

distantly. Momma has a great deal of manner with strangers; it sometimes

completely disguises her real feeling toward them. I was also grateful,

though I merely bowed, and kicked the Senator under the table. Nobody

would have guessed from our outward bearing the extent to which our

political fortunes, as a family, were mixed up with Mike McConnell's.

Mr. Malt immediately said that if there was anything else he could do

for us he was at our service.
"Well," said poppa, "I suppose there's a good deal of intrinsic interest

in this town—relics of Napoleon, the Bon Marché, and so on—and we've

got to see it. I must say," he added, turning to momma, "I feel

considerably more equal to it now."
"It will take you a good long week," said Mr. Malt earnestly, "to begin

to have an idea of it. You might spend two whole days in the Louvre

itself. Is your time limited?"
"I don't need to tell any American the market value of it," said poppa

smiling.
"Then you can't do better than go straight to the Louvre. I'd be pleased

to accompany you, only I've got to go round and see our Ambassador—I've

got a little business with him. I daresay you know that one of our

man-of-war ships is lying right down here in the Seine river. Well, the

captain is giving a reception to-morrow in honour of the Russian Admiral

who happens to be there, too. I've got ladies with me and I wrote for

four tickets. Did I get the four tickets—or two of them—or one? No,

sir, I got a letter in the third person singular saying it wasn't a

public entertainment! I wrote back to say I guessed it was an American

entertainment, and he could expect me, all the same. He hadn't any sort

of excuse—my name and business address were on my letter paper. Now I'm

just going round to see what a United States Ambassador's for, in this

connection."
Mr. Malt rose and the waiter withdrew his chair. "Thank you, garçon,"

said he. "I'm coming back again—do you understand? This is not my last

meal," and the waiter bowed as if that were a statement which had to be

acknowledged, but was of the least possible consequence to him

personally. "Well, Mr. Wick," continued Mr. Malt, brushing the crumbs

from his waistcoat, "I'll say good morning, and to your ladies also. I'm

very pleased to have met you."
"Well," said momma, as he disappeared, "if every American in Paris has

decided to go to that reception there won't be much room for the

Russians."
"I suppose he's a voter and a tax-payer, and he's got his feelings,"

replied poppa. The Senator would defend a voter and a tax-payer against

any imputation not actually criminal.
"I'm glad I'm not one of his lady-friends," momma continued. "I don't

think I could make myself at home on that man-of-war under the

circumstances. But I daresay he'll drag them there with him. He seems to

be just that kind of a man."
"He's a very patriotic kind of a man," replied the Senator. "It's his

patriotism, don't you see, that's giving him all this trouble. It's been

outraged. Personally I consider Mr. Malt a very intelligent gentleman,

and if he'd given me an opening as big as the eye of a needle I'm the

camel that would have gone with him, Augusta."
This statement of the Senator's struck me as something to be acted upon.

If there was to be a constant possibility of his going off with any

chance American in regular communication with the United States, our

European tour would be a good deal less interesting than I had been led

to expect. While momma was getting ready for the Louvre, therefore, I

stepped down to the office and wired our itinerary to his partner in

Chicago. "Keep up daily communication by wire in detail," I telegraphed,

"forward copies all important letters care Peters." Peters was the

tourist agent who had undertaken to bless our comings and goings. I said

nothing whatever to poppa, but I felt a glow of conscious triumph when I

thought of Mr. Malt.
We stood and realised Paris on the pavement while the fiacre turned in

from the road and drew up for us. I had every intention of being

fascinated and so had momma. We had both heard often and often that good

Americans when they die go to Paris, and that prepares one for a good

deal in this life. We were so anxious to be pleased that we fastened

with one accord upon the florist's shop under the hotel and said that it

was uniquely charming, though we both knew places in Broadway that it

couldn't be compared with. We looked amiably at the passers-by, and did

our best to detect in the manner of their faces that esprit that makes

the dialogue of French novels so stimulating. What I usually thought I

saw when they looked at us was a leisurely indifferentism ornamented

with the suspicion of a sneer, and based upon a certain fundamental

acquisitiveness and ability to make a valuation that acknowledged the

desirability of our presence on business grounds, if not on personal

ones. It seemed to be a preconcerted public intention to make as much

noise in a given space as possible—we spoke of the cheerfulness of it,

stopping our ears. The cracking of the drivers' whips alone made a feu

de joie that never ceased, and listening to it we knew that we ought to

feel happy and elated. The driver of our fiacre was fat and rubicund, he

wore a green coat, brass buttons, and a shiny top hat, and looked as if

he drank constantly. His jollity was perfunctory, I know, and covered a

grasping nature, but it was very well imitated, like everything in

Paris. As he whirled us, with a whip-report like a pistol-shot, into the

train of traffic in the middle of the street, we felt that we were

indeed in the city of appearances; and I put down in my mind, not having

my note-book, that Paris lives up to its photographs.
"We mustn't forget our serious object, dear," said momma, as we rolled

over the cobblestones—"our literary object. What shall we note this

morning? The broad streets, the elegant shops—do look at that one!

Darling, is it absolutely necessary to go to the Louvre this morning?

There are some things we really need."
Momma addressed the Senator. I mentioned to her once that her way of

doing it was almost English in its demonstrativeness, and my other

parent told me privately he wished I hadn't—it aggravated it so.
"Augusta," said poppa, firmly, "I understand your feeling. I take a

human interest in those stores myself, which I do not expect this

picture gallery, etc., to inspire in me. But there the Louvre is, you

see, and it's got to be done. If we spent our whole time in this city in

mere pleasure and amusement, you would be the first to reproach

yourself, Augusta."
A few minutes later, when we had crossed the stone quadrangle and

mounted the stairs, and stood with our catalogue in the Salle Lacaze,

momma said that she wouldn't have missed it for anything. She sank

ecstatic upon a bench, and gave to every individual picture upon the

opposite wall the tribute of her intensest admiration. It was a pleasure

to see her enjoying herself so much; and poppa and I vainly tried to

keep up to her with the catalogue.
"Oh, why haven't we such things in Chicago!" she exclaimed, at which the

Senator checked her mildly.
"It's a mere question of time," said he. "It isn't reasonable to expect

Pre-Raphaelites in a new country. But give us three or four hundred

years, and we'll produce old masters which, if you ladies will excuse

the expression, will knock the spots out of the Middle Ages." Poppa is

such an optimist about Chicago.
The Senator went on in a strain of criticism of the pictures perfectly

moderate and kindly—nothing he wouldn't have said to the artists

themselves—until momma interrupted him. "Don't you think we might be

silent for a time, Alexander," she said.
Momma does call him Alexander sometimes. I didn't like to mention it

before, but it can't be concealed for ever. She says it's because Joshua

always costs her an effort, and every woman ought to have the right to

name her own husband.
"Let us offer to all this genius," she continued, indicating it, "the

tribute of sealing our lips."
The Senator will always oblige. "Mine are sealed, Augusta," he replied,

and so we sat in silence for the next ten minutes. But I could see by

his expression, in connection with the angle at which his hat was

tipped, that he was comparing the productions before him with the future

old masters of Chicago, and wishing it were possible to live long enough

to back Chicago.
"How they do sink in!" said momma at last. "How they sink into the

soul!"
"They do," replied the Senator. "I don't deny it. But I see by the

catalogue, counting Salles and Salons and all, there's seventeen rooms

full of them. If they're all to sink in, for my part I'll have to

enlarge the premises. And we've been here three-quarters of an hour

already, and life is short, Augusta."
So we moved on where the imperishable faces of Greuze and Velasquez and

Rembrandt smiled and frowned and wondered at us. As poppa said, it was

easy to see that these people had ideas, and were simply longing to

express them. "You feel sorry for them," he said, "just as you feel

sorry for an intelligent terrier. But these poor things can't even wag

their tails! Just let me know when you've had enough, Augusta."
Momma declared, with an accent of reproach, that she could never have

enough. I noticed, however, that we did not stay in the second room as

long as in the first one, and that our progress was steadily

accelerating. Presently the Senator asked us to sit down for a few

minutes while he should leave us.
"There's a picture here Bramley said I was to see without fail," he

explained. "It's called 'Mona Lisa,' and it's by an artist by the name

of Leonardo da Vinci. Bramley said it was a very fine painting, but I

don't remember just now whether he said it was what you might call a

picture for the family or not. I'll just go and ascertain," said the

Senator. "Judging from some of the specimens here, oil paintings in the

Middle Ages weren't intended to be chromo-lithographed."
In his absence momma and I discussed French cookery as far as we had

experienced it, in detail, with prodigious yawns for which we did not

even apologise. Poppa was gone a remarkably short time and came back

radiant. "I've found Mona," he exclaimed, "and—she's all right. Bramley

said it was the most remarkable portrait of a woman in the

world—looking at it, Bramley said, you become insensible to

everything—forget all about your past life and future hopes—and I

guess he's about right. Come and see it."
Momma arose without enthusiasm, and I thought I detected adverse

criticism in advance in her expression.
"Here she is," said the Senator presently. "Now look at that! Did you

ever see anything more intellectual and cynical, and contemptuous and

sweet, all in one! Lookin' at you as much as to say, 'Who are you,

anyhow, from way back in the State of Illinois—commercial traveller?

And what do you pretend to know?'"
Momma regarded the portrait for a moment in calm disapprobation. "I

daresay she was very clever," she said at length, "but if you wish to

know my opinion I don't think much of her. And before taking us to see

another female portrait, Mr. Wick, I should be obliged if you would take

the precaution of finding out who she was."
After which we drove quietly home.

CHAPTER VI.
Poppa decided that we had better go to Versailles by Cook's

four-in-hand. There were other ways of going, but he thought we might as

well take the most distinguished. He was careful to explain that the

mere grandeur of this method of transportation had no weight with him;

he was compelled to submit to the ostentation of it for another purpose

which he had in view.
"I am not a person," said poppa, "nor is any member of my family, to

thrust myself into aristocratic circles in foreign lands; but when an

opportunity like this occurs for observing them without prejudice, so to

speak, I believe in taking it."
We went to the starting place early, so as to get good seats, for, as

momma said, the whole of the Parisian élite with the President thrown

in wouldn't induce her to ride with her back to the horses. In that

position she would be incapable of observation.
The coaches were not there when we arrived, and presently the Senator

discovered why. He told us with a slightly depressed air that they had

gone round to the hotels. "Daughter," he said to me, "J.P. Wicks does

hate to make a fool of himself, and this morning he's done it twice

over. The best seats will go to the people who had the sense to stay at

their hotels, and the fact that the coaches go round shows that they run

for tourist traffic only. There won't be a Paris aristocrat among them,"

continued poppa gloomily, "nary an aristocrat."
When they came up we saw that there wasn't. The coaches were full of

tourist traffic. It was mounted on the box seats very high up, where it

looked conspicuously happy, and sounded a little hysterical; and it was

packed, tight and warm and anticipant into every available seat. From

its point of vantage, secured by waiting at the hotel for it, the

tourist traffic looked down upon the Wick family on the pavement, in

irritating compassion. As momma said, if we hadn't taken our tickets it

was enough to have sent us to the Bon Marché.
A man in a black frock coat and white shirt cuffs came bareheaded from

the office and pointed us out to the interpreter, who wore brass

buttons. The interpreter appeared to mention it to the guide, who wiped

his perspiring brows under a soft brown felt hat. A fiacre crawled round

the corner and paused to look on, and the Senator said, "Now which of

you three gentlemen is responsible for my ride to Versailles?"
The interpreter looked at him with a hostile expression, the guide made

a gesture of despair at the volume of tourist traffic, and the man with

the shirt cuffs said, "You 'ave took your plazes on ze previous day?"
"I took them from you ten minutes ago," poppa replied. "What a memory

you've got!"
"Zen zare is nothings guaranteed. But we will send special carriage, and

be'ind you can follow up," and he indicated the fiacre which had now

drawn into line.
"I don't think so," said poppa, "when I buy four-in-hand tickets I don't

take one-in-hand accommodation."
"You will not go in ze private carriage?"
"I will not."
"Mais—it is much ze preferable."
"I don't know why I should contradict you," said poppa, but at that

moment the difficulty was solved by the Misses Bingham.
"Guide!" cried one of the Misses Bingham, beckoning with her fan, "Nous

voulons à déscendre!"
"You want get out?"
"Oui!" replied the Misses Bingham with simultaneous dignity, and, as

the guide merely wiped his forehead again, poppa stepped forward. "Can I

assist you?" he said, and the Misses Bingham allowed themselves to be

assisted. They were small ladies, dressed in black pongee silk, with

sloping shoulders, and they each carried a black fan and a brocaded bag

for odds and ends. They were not plain-looking, and yet it was readily

seen why nobody had ever married them; they had that look of the

predestined single state that you sometimes see even among the very well

preserved. One of them had an eye-glass, but it was easy to note even

when she was not wearing it that she was a person of independent income,

of family, and of New York.
"We are quite willing," said the Misses Bingham, "to exchange our seats

in the coach for yours in the special carriage, if that arrangement

suits you."
"Bon!" interposed the guide, "and opposite there is one other place if

that fat gentleman will squeeze himself a little—eh?"
"Come along!" said the fat gentleman equably.
"But I couldn't think of depriving you ladies."
"Sir," said one Miss Bingham, "it is no deprivation."
"We should prefer it," added the other Miss Bingham. They spoke with

decision; one saw that they had not reached middle age without knowing

their own minds all the way.
"To tell the truth," added the Miss Bingham without the eye-glass in a

low voice, "we don't think we can stand it."
"I don't precisely take you, madam," said the Senator politely.
"I'm an American," she continued.
Poppa bowed. "I should have known you for a daughter of the Stars and

Stripes anywhere," he said in his most complimentary tone.
Miss Bingham looked disconcerted for an instant and went on. "My great

grandfather was A.D.C. to General Washington. I've got that much reason

to be loyal."
"There couldn't have been many such officers," the Senator agreed.
"But when I go abroad I don't want the whole of the United States to

come with me."
"It takes the gilt off getting back for you?" suggested poppa a little

stiffly.
Miss Bingham failed to take the hint. "We find Europe infested with

Americans," she continued. "It disturbs one's impressions so. And the

travelling American invariably belongs to the very least desirable

class."
"Now I shouldn't have thought so," said the Senator, with intentional

humour. But it was lost upon Miss Bingham.
"Well, if you like them," said the other one, "you'd better go in the

coach."
The Senator lifted his hat. "Madam," he said, "I thank you for giving to

me and mine the privilege of visiting a very questionable scene of the

past in the very best society of the present."
And as the guide was perspiring more and more impatiently, we got in.
For some moments the Senator sat in silence, reflecting upon this

sentiment, with an occasionally heaving breast. Circumstances forbade

his talking about it, but he cast an eye full of criticism upon the

fiacre rolling along far in the rear, and remarked, with a fervor most

unusual, that he hoped they liked our dust. We certainly made a great

deal of it. Momma and I, looking at our fellow travellers, at once

decided that the Misses Bingham had been a little hasty. The fat

gentleman, who wore a straw hat very far back, and meant to enjoy

himself, was certainly our fellow-citizen. So was his wife, and

brother-in-law. So were a bride and bridegroom on the box seat—nothing

less than the best of everything for an American honeymoon—and so was a

solitary man with a short cut bristly beard, a slouch hat, a pink cotton

shirt, and a celluloid collar. But there was an indescribable something

about all the rest that plainly showed they had never voted for a

president or celebrated a Fourth of July. I was still revolving it in my

mind when the fat gentleman, who had been thinking of the same thing,

said to his neighbour on the other side, a person of serious appearance

in a black silk hat, apropos of the line he had crossed by, "I may be

wrong, but I shouldn't have put you down to be an American."
"Oh, I guess I am," replied the serious man, "but not the United States

kind."
"British North," suggested the fat gentleman, with a smile that

acknowledged Her Majesty. "First cousin once removed," and momma and I

looked at one another intelligently. We had nothing against Canadians,

except that they generally talk as if they had the whole of the St.

Lawrence river and Niagara Falls in a perpetual lease from

Providence—and we had never seen so many of them together before. The

coach was three-quarters full of these foreigners, if the Misses

Bingham had only known; but as poppa afterwards said, they were probably

not foreign enough. It may have been imagination, but I immediately

thought I saw a certain meekness, a habit of deference—I wanted to

incite them all to treat the Guelphs as we did. Just then we stopped

before the church of St. Augustin, and the guide came swinging along the

outside of the coach hoarsely emitting facts. Everybody listened

intently, and I noticed upon the Canadian countenances the same

determination to be instructed that we always show ourselves. We all

meant to get the maximum amount of information for the price, and I

don't think any of us have forgotten that the site of St. Augustin is

three-cornered and its dome resembles a tiara to this day. For a moment

I was sorry for the Misses Bingham, who were absorbing nothing but dust;

but, as momma said, they looked very well informed.
It must be admitted that we were a little shy with the guide—we let him

bully us. As poppa said, he was certainly well up in his subject, but

that was no reason why he should have treated us as if we had all come

from St. Paul or Kansas City. There was a condescension about him that

was not explained by the state of his linen, and a familiarity that I

had always supposed confined exclusively to the British aristocracy

among themselves. He had a red face and a blue eye, with which he looked

down on us with scarcely concealed contempt, and he was marvellously

agile, distributing his information as open street-car conductors

collect fares.
"They seem extremely careful of their herbage in this town," remarked

the serious man, and we noticed that it was so. Precautions were taken

in wire that would have dissuaded a grasshopper from venturing on it. It

grew very neatly inside, doubtless with a certain chic, but it had a

look of being put on for the occasion that was essentially Parisian.

Also the trees grew up out of iron plates, which was uncomfortable,

though, no doubt, highly finished, and the flowers had a cachet about

them which made one think of French bonnets. As we rolled into the Bois

it became evident that the guide had something special to communicate.

He raised his voice and coughed, in a manner which commanded instant

attention.
"Ladies—and genelmen," he said—he always added the gentleman as if

they were an after-thought—"you are mos' fortunate, mos' locky. Tout

Paris—all the folks—are still driving their 'orse an' carriage 'ere.

One week more—the style will be all gone—what you say—vamoosed? Every

mother's son! An' Cook's excursion party won't see nothin' but ole cabs

goin' along!"
"Can't we get away from them?" asked the serious person. It was

humorously intended—certainly a liberty, and the guide was down on it

in an instant.
"Get away from them? Not if they know you're here!"
At which the serious man looked still more serious, and sympathy for

him sprang up in every heart.
We passed Longchamps at a steady trot, and the guide's statement that

the races there were always held on Sunday was received with a silence

that evidently disappointed him. It was plain that he had a withering

rejoinder ready for sabbatarians, and he waited anxiously, balanced on

one foot, for an expression of shocked opinion. It was after we had

passed Mont Valerien, frowning on the horizon, that the man in the pink

cotton shirt began to grow restive under so much instruction. He told

the serious person that his name was Hinkson of Iowa, and the serious

person was induced to reply that his was Pabbley of Simcoe, Ontario. It

was insubordination—the guide was talking about the shelling from Mont

Valerien at the time, with the most patriotic dislocations in his

grammar.
"You understan', you see?" he concluded. "Now those two genelmen, they

don' understan', and they don' see. An' when they get back to the

United States they won' be able to tell their wives an' sweethearts

anythin' about Mont Valerien! All right, genelmen—please yourselves.

Mais you please remember I am just like William Shekspeare—I give no

repétition!"
It was then that the serious man demonstrated that Britons, even the

North American kind, never, never would be slaves. Placing his black

silk hat carefully a little further back on his head, he leaned forward.
"Now look here, mister," he said, "you're as personal as a Yankee

newspaper. So far as I know, you're not the friend of my childhood, nor

the companion of my later years, except for this trip only, and I'd just

as soon you realised it. As far as I know, you're paid to point out

objects of historical interest. Don't you trouble to entertain us any

further than that. We'll excuse you!"
"Ladies—an' genelmen," continued the guide calmly, "in a lil' short

while we shall be approached to the town of St. Cloud. At that town of

St. Cloud will be one genelman will take the excellen' group—fotograff.

To appear in that fotograff, you will please all keep together with me.

Afterwards, you will look at the fountains, at the magnificent panorama

de Paris, and we go on to Versailles. On the return journey, if you like

that fotograff you can buy, if you don't like, you don' buy. An' if you

got no wife an' no sweetheart all the same you keep your temper!"
But Mr. Pabbley had settled his hat in its normal position and did not

intend to clear his brow for action again. All might have gone well, had

it not been for the patriotic sensitiveness of Mr. Hinkson of Iowa.
"I think I heard you pass a remark about American newspapers, sir," said

Mr Hinkson of Iowa. "Think you've got any better in Canada?"
Mr. Pabbley smiled. There may have been some fancied superiority in the

smile.
"I guess they suit us better," he said.
"Got any circulation figures about you?"
"Not being an advertising agent, I don't carry them."
"I see!" Mr. Hinkson's manner of saying he saw clearly implied that

there might have been other reasons why Mr. Pabbley declined to produce

those figures. We were all listening now, and the guide had subsided

upon the box seat. The Senator's face wore the judicial expression it

always assumes when he has a difficulty in keeping himself out of the

conversation. It became easier than ever to separate the Republican and

the British elements on that coach.
"Well," said Mr. Hinkson, "don't you folks get pretty tired of paying

Victoria taxes sometimes?"
The British contingent seemed to find this amusing. The Americans looked

as if it were no laughing matter.
"I don't believe Her Majesty is much the richer for all she gets out of

us," said Mr. Pabbley.
"Oh, I guess you send over a pretty good lump per annum, don't you?"
"Not a red cent, sir," said Mr. Pabbley decisively. "We run our own

show."
"What about that aristocrat that rules the country up at Ottawa?"
"Oh, he hasn't got any say! We get him out and pay him a salary to

save ourselves the trouble of electing a president. A presidential

election's bad for business, bad for politics, bad for morals."
"You seem to know. Doesn't it ever make you tired to hear yourselves

called subjects? Don't you ever want to be free and equal, like us?

Trot out the truth now—the George Washington article!"
"Mister," said Mr. Pabbley, "I flatter myself that Canadians are a good

deal like United States folks already, and I don't mind congratulating

both our nations on the resemblance. But I'm bound to add that, while I

would wish to imitate the American people in many ways still further, I

wouldn't be like you personally, no, not under any circumstances nor in

any respect."
At this moment it was necessary to dismount, and, as poppa and I both

immediately became engaged in reconciling momma to the necessity of

walking to the top of the plateau, I lost the rest of the conversation.

Momma, when it was necessary to walk anywhere, always became pathetic

and offered to stay behind alone. She declared on this occasion that she

would be perfectly happy in the coach with the dear horses, and poppa

had to resort to extreme measures. "Please yourself, Augusta," he said.

"Your lightest whim is law to me, and you know it. But I'm going to hate

standing up in that photograph all alone with my only child, like any

widower."
"Alexander!" exclaimed momma at once. "What a dreadful idea! I think I

might be able to manage it."
The photographer was there with his camera. The guide marshalled us up

to him, falling back now and then to bark at the heels of the lagging

ones, and, with the assistance of a bench and an acacia, we were rapidly

arranged, the short ones standing up, the tall ones sitting down,

everyone assuming his most pleasing expression, and the Misses Bingham

standing alone, apart, on the brink, looking on under an umbrella that

seemed to protect them from intimate association with the democracy in

any form. We saw the guide approach them in gingerly inquiry, but,

before simultaneous waves of their two black fans, he retired in

disorder. The bride had slipped her hand upon her husband's shoulder,

just to mark his identity; the fat gentleman had removed his hat and

hurriedly put it on again, and the photographer had gone under his

curtain for the third time, when Mr. Hinkson of Iowa, who sat in a

conspicuous cross-legged position in the foreground, drew from his

pocket a handkerchief and spread it carefully out over one knee. It was

not an ordinary handkerchief, it was a pocket edition of the Stars and

Stripes, all red, and blue, and white, and it attracted the instant

attention of every eye. One of the eyes was Mr. Pabbley's, who appeared

to clear the group at a bound in consequence.
"Ladies and gentlemen," exclaimed Mr. Pabbley with vehemence, "does

anyone happen to have a Union Jack about him or her?"
They felt in their pockets, but they hadn't.
"Then," said Mr. Pabbley, who was evidently aroused, "unless the

gentleman from Iowa will withdraw his handkerchief, I refuse to sit."
"I guess we aren't any of us annexationists," said a middle-aged woman

from Toronto in a duster, and proceeded to follow Mr. Pabbley.
The rest of the Canadians looked at each other undecidedly for a moment

and then slowly filed after the middle-aged woman. There remained the

mere wreck of a group clustering round the national emblem on the leg of

Mr. Hinkson. The guide was expostulating himself speechless, the

photographer was in convulsions, the Senator saw it was time to

interfere. Leaning over, he gently tapped the patriot from Iowa on the

shoulder.
"Aren't you satisfied with the sixty million fellow-citizens you've got

already," said poppa, "that you want to grab nine half-starved Canucks

with a hand camera?"
"They're in the majority here," said Mr. Hinkson fiercely, "and I dare

any one of 'em to touch that flag. Go along over there and join 'em if

you like—they're goin' to be done by themselves—to send to Queen

Victoria!"
But that was further than anybody would go, even in defence of

cosmopolitanism. The Republic rallied round Mr. Hinkson's leg, while the

Dominion with much dignity supported Mr. Pabbley. As momma said, human

nature is perfectly extraordinary.
For the rest of the journey to Versailles there was hardly any

international conversation. Mr. Hinkson tied his handkerchief round his

neck, and the Canadians tried to look as if they had no objection. We

passed through the villages of Montretout and Buze. I know we did

because momma took down the names, but I fancy they couldn't have

differed much from the general landscape, for I don't remember a thing

about them. The Misses Bingham came and sat next us at luncheon, which

flattered both momma and me immensely, though the Senator didn't seem

able to see where the distinction came in, and during this meal they

pointed out the fact that Mr. Hinkson was drinking lemonade with his

roast mutton, and asked us how we could travel with such a

combination. I remember poppa said that it was a combination that Mr.

Hinkson and Mr. Hinkson only had to deal with, but momma and I felt the

obloquy of it a good deal, though when we came to think of it we were no

more responsible for Mr. Hinkson than the Misses Bingham were. After

that, walking rapidly behind the guide, we covered centuries of French

history, illustrated by chairs and tables and fire-irons and chandeliers

and four-post beds. Momma told me afterwards that she was rather sorry

she had taken me with the guide through Madame du Barry's fascinating

Petit Trianon, the things he didn't say sounded so improper, but when I

assured her that it was only contemporary scandal that had any effect on

our morals, she said she supposed that was so, and somehow one never did

expect people who wore curled wigs and knee-breeches to behave quite

prettily. The rooms were dotted with groups of people who had come in

fiacres or by tramway, which made it difficult for the guide to impart

his information only to those who had paid for it. He generally

surmounted this by saying, "Ladies and genelmen, I want you to stick

closer than brothers. When you hear me a-talkin' don' you go turnin'

over your Baedekers and lookin' out of the window. If I didn't know a

great big sight more about Versailles than Baedeker does I wouldn't be

here makin' a clown of myself; an' I'll show you the view out of the

window all in good time. You see that lady an' two genelmen over there?

They're listenin' all right enough because they don't belong to this

party an' they want to get a little information cheap price. All

right—I let 'em have it!" At which the lady and two gentlemen usually

melted away looking annoyed.
We were fascinated with the coaches of state and much impressed with the

cost of them. As momma said, it took so very little imagination to

conjure up a Royal Philip inside bowing to the populace.
"What a pity we couldn't have had them over!" said poppa indiscreetly.
"Where you mean?" demanded the guide, "over to America? I know—for that

ole Chicago show! You are the five hundred American who has said that to

me this summer! Number five hundred! Nossir, we don't lend those

carriage. We don't even drive them ourself."
"No more kings and queens nowadays," remarked Mr. Hinkson, "this

century's got no use for them."
I think the guide was a Monarchist. "Nossir," he said, "you don't see no

more kings an' queens of France, but you do see a good many people

travellin' that's nothin' like so good for trade."
At which Mr. Pabbley's eye sought that of the guide, and expressed its

appreciation in a marked and joyous wink.
In the Palace, especially in the picture rooms, there were generally

benches along the walls. When momma observed this she arranged that she

should go on ahead and sit down and get the impression, while poppa and

I caught up from time to time with the guide and the information. The

guide was quite agreeable about it, when it was explained to him.
He was either a very thoughtless or a very insincere person, however.

Stopping before the portrait of an officer in uniform, he drew us all

together. The Canadians, headed by Mr. Pabbley, were well to the fore,

and it was to them in particular that he appeared to address himself

when he said, "Take a good look at this picture, ladies and genelmen.

There is a man wat lives in your 'istory an', if I may say, in your

'art—as he does in ours. There's a man, ladies and genelmen, that

helped you on to liberty. Take a good look at 'im, you'll be glad to

remember it afterward."
And it was General Lafayette!

CHAPTER VII.
It was after dinner and we were sitting in the little courtyard of the

hotel in the dark without our hats—that is, momma and I; the Senator

was seldom altogether without his hat. I think he would have felt it to

be a little indecent. The courtyard was paved, and there were flowers on

the stand in the middle of it, natural palms and artificial begonias

mixed with the most annoying cleverness, and little tables for coffee

cups or glasses were scattered about. Outside beyond the hotel vestibule

one could see and hear Paris rolling by in the gaslight. It was the only

place in the hotel that did not smell of furniture, so we frequented it.

So did Mr. Malt and Mrs. Malt, and Emmeline Malt, and Miss Callis. That

was chiefly how we made the acquaintance of the Malt party. You can't

very well sit out in the dark in a foreign capital with a family from

your own State and not get to know them. Besides poppa never could

overcome his feeling of indebtedness to Mr. Malt. They were taking

Emmeline abroad for her health. She was the popular thirteen-year-old

only child of American families, and she certainly was thin. I remember

being pleased, sometimes, considering her in her typical capacity, that

I once had a little brother, though he died before I was born.
The two gentlemen were smoking; we could see nothing but the ends of

their cigars glowing in their immediate vicinity. Momma was saying that

the situation was very romantic, and Mr. Malt had assured her that it

was nothing to what we would experience in Italy. "That's where you

get romance," said Mr. Malt, and his cigar end dropped like a falling

star as he removed the ash. "Italy's been romantic ever since B.C. All

through the time the rest of the world was inventing Magna Chartas and

Doomsday Books, and Parliaments, and printing presses, and steam

engines, Italy's gone right on turning out romance. Result is, a better

quality of that article to be had in Italy to-day than anywhere else.

Further result, twenty million pounds spent there annually by tourists

from all parts of the civilised world. Romance, like anything else, can

be made to pay."
"Are we likely to find the beds——" began Mrs. Malt plaintively.
"Oh dear yes, Mrs. Malt!" interrupted momma, who thought everything

entomological extremely indelicate. "Perfectly. You have only to go to

the hotels the guide-books recommend, and everything will be quite

propre."
"Well," said Emmeline, "they may be propre in Italy, but they're not

propre in Paris. We had to speak to the housemaid yesterday morning,

didn't we, mother? Don't you remember the back of my neck?"
"We all suffered!" declared Mrs. Malt.
"And I showed one to her, mother, and all she would say was, 'Jamais

ici, mademoiselle, ici, jamais!' And there it was you know."
"Emmeline," said her father, "isn't it about time for you to want to go

to bed?"
"Not by about three hours. I'm going to get up a little music first. Do

you play, Mis' Wick?"
Momma said she didn't, and Miss Malt disappeared in search of other

performers. "Don't you go asking strangers to play, Emmeline," her

mother called after her. "They'll think it forward of you."
"When Emmeline leaves us," said her father, "I always have a kind of

abandoned feeling, like a top that's got to the end of its spin."
There was silence for a moment, and then the Senator said he thought he

could understand that.
"Well," continued Mr. Malt, "you've had three whole days now. I presume

you're beginning to know your way around."
"I think we may say we've made pretty good use of our time," responded

the Senator. "This morning we had a look in at the Luxembourg picture

gallery, and the Madeleine, and Napoleon's Tomb, and the site of the

Bastile. This afternoon we took a run down to Notre Dame Cathedral.

That's a very fine building, sir."
"You saw the Morgue, of course, when you were in that direction,"

remarked Mr. Malt.
"Why no," poppa confessed, "we haven't taken much of liking for live

Frenchmen, up to the present, and I don't suppose dead ones would be any

more attractive."
"Oh, there's nothing unpleasant," said Mrs. Malt, "nothing that you can

notice."
"Nothing at all," said Mr. Malt. "They refrigerate them, you know. We

send our beef to England by the same process——"
"There are people," the Senator interrupted, "who never can see anything

amusing in a corpse."
"They don't let you in as a matter of course," Mr. Malt went on. "You

have to pretend that you're looking for a relation."
"We had to mention Uncle Sammy," said Mrs. Malt.
"An uncle of Mis' Malt's who went to California in '49 and was never

heard of afterward," Mr. Malt explained. "First use he's ever been to

his family. Well, there they were, seven of 'em, lying there looking at

you yesterday. All in good condition. I was told they have a place

downstairs for the older ones."
"Alexander," said momma faintly, "I think I should like a little

brandy in my coffee. Were there—were there any ladies among them, Mr.

Malt?"
"Three," Mr. Malt responded briskly, "and one of them had her hair——"
"Then please don't tell us about them," momma exclaimed, and the

silence that ensued was one of slight indignation on the part of the

Malt family.
"You been seeing the town at all, evenings?" Mr. Malt inquired of the

Senator.
"I can't say I have. We've been seeing so much of it in the daytime, we

haven't felt able to enjoy anything at night except our beds," poppa

returned with his accustomed candour.
"Just so. All the same there's a good deal going on in Paris after

supper."
"So I've always been told," said the Senator, lighting another cigar.
"They've got what you might call characteristic shows here. You see a

lot of life."
"Can you take your ladies?" asked the Senator.
"Well of course you can, but I don't believe they would find it

interesting."
"Too much life," said the Senator. "I guess that settles it for me too.

I daresay I'm lacking in originality and enterprise, but I generally ask

myself about an entertainment, 'Are Mrs. and Miss Wick likely to enjoy

it?' If so, well and good. If not, I don't as a rule take it in."
"He's a great comfort that way," remarked momma to Mrs. Malt.
"Oh, I don't frequent them myself," said Mr. Malt defensively.
"Talking of improprieties," remarked Miss Callis, "have you seen the

New Salon?"
There was something very unexpected about Miss Callis; momma complained

of it. Her remarks were never polished by reflection. She called herself

a child of nature, but she really resided in Brooklyn.
The Senator said we had not.
"Then don't you go, Mr. Wick. There's a picture there——"
"We never look at such pictures, Miss Callis," momma interrupted.
"It's so French," said Miss Callis.
Momma drew her shawl round her preparatory to withdrawing, but it was

too late.
"Too French for words," continued Miss Callis. "The poet Lamartine, with

a note-book and pencil in his hand, seated in a triumphal chariot, drawn

through the clouds by beautiful Muses."
"Oh," said momma, in a relieved voice, "there's nothing so dreadfully

French about that."
"You should have seen it," said Miss Callis. "It was simply immoral.

Lamartine was in a frock coat!"
"There could have been nothing objectionable in that," momma repeated.

"I suppose the Muses——"
"The Muses were not in frock coats. They were dressed in their

traditions," replied Miss Callis, "but they couldn't save the situation,

poor dears."
Momma looked as if she wished she had the courage to ask Miss Callis to

explain.
"In picture galleries," remarked poppa, "we've seen only the Luxembourg

and the Louvre. The Louvre, I acknowledge, is worthy of a second visit.

But I don't believe we'll have time to get round again."
"We've got to get a hustle on ourselves in a day or two," said Mr. Malt,

as we separated for the night. "There's all Italy and Switzerland

waiting for us, and they're bound to be done, because we've got circular

tickets. But there's something about this town that I hate to leave."
"He doesn't know whether it's the Arc de Triomphe on the Bois de

Boulogne or the Opera Comique, or what," said Mrs. Malt in affectionate

criticism. "But we've been here a week over our time now, and he doesn't

seem able to tear himself away."
"I'll tell you what it is," exclaimed Mr. Malt, producing a newspaper,

"it's this little old New York Herald. There's no use comparing it

with any American newspaper, and it wouldn't be fair to do so; but I

wonder these French rags, in a foreign tongue, aren't ashamed to be

published in the same capital with it. It doesn't take above a quarter

of an hour to read in the mornings, but it's a quarter of an hour of

solid comfort that you don't expect somehow abroad. If the New York

Herald were only published in Rome I wouldn't mind going there."
"There's something," said poppa, thoughtfully, as we ascended to the

third floor, "in what Malt says."
Next day we spent an hour buying trunks for the accommodation of the

unattainable elsewhere. Then poppa reminded us that we had an important

satisfaction yet to experience. "Business before pleasure," he said,

"certainly. But we've been improving our minds pretty hard for the last

few days, and I feel the need of a little relaxation. D.V. and W.P., I

propose this afternoon to make the ascent of the Eiffel Tower. Are you

on?"
"I will accompany you, Alexander, if it is safe," said momma, "and, if

it is unsafe, I couldn't possibly let you go without me."
Momma is naturally a person of some timidity, but when the Senator

proposes to incur any danger, she always suggests that he shall do it

over her dead body.
I forget where we were at the time, but I know that we had only to walk

through the perpetual motion of Paris, across a bridge, and down a few

steps on the other side, to find the little steamer that took us by the

river to the Tower. We might have gone by omnibus or by fiacre, but if

we had we should never have known what a street the Seine is, sliding

through Paris, brown in the open sun, dark under the shadowing arches of

the bridges, full of hastening comers and goers from landing-place to

landing-place, up and down. It gave us quite a new familiarity with the

river, which had been before only a part of the landscape, and one of

the things that made Paris imposing. We saw that it was a highway of

traffic, and that the little, brisk, business-like steamers were full of

people, who went about in them because it was the cheapest and most

convenient way, and not at all for the pleasure of a trip by water. We

noticed, too, a difference in these river-going people. Some of them

carried baskets, and some of them read the Petit Journal, and they all

comfortably submitted to the good-natured bullying of the mariner in

charge. There were elderly women in black, with a button or two off

their tight bodices, and children with patched shoes carrying an

assortment of vegetables, and middle-aged men in slouch hats, smoking

tobacco that would have been forbidden by public statute anywhere else.

They all treated us with a respect and consideration which we had not

observed in the Avenue de l'Opera, and I noticed the Senator visibly

expanding in it. There was also a man and a little boy, and a dog, all

lunching out of the same basket. Afterward, on being requested to do so,

the dog performed tricks—French ones—to the enjoyment and satisfaction

of all three. There was a great deal of politeness and good feeling, and

if they were not Capi and Remi and Vitalis in "Sans Famille," it was

merely because their circumstances were different.
As we stood looking at the Eiffel Tower, poppa said he thought if he

were in my place he wouldn't describe it. "It's old news," he said, "and

there's nothing the general public dislike so much as that. Every

hotel-porter in Chicago knows that it's three hundred metres high, and

that you can see through it all the way up. There it is, and I feel as

if I'd passed my boyhood in its shadow. That way I must say it's a

disappointment. I was expecting it to be more unexpected, if you

understand."
Momma and I quite agreed. It had the familiarity of a demonstration of

Euclid, and to the non-engineering mind was about as interesting. The

Senator felt so well acquainted with it that he hesitated about buying a

descriptive pamphlet. "They want to sell a stranger too much information

in this country," he said. "The meanest American intelligence is equal

to stepping into an elevator and stepping out again." But he bought one

nevertheless, and was particularly pleased with it, not only because it

was the cheapest thing in Paris at five cents, but because, as he said

himself, it contained an amount of enthusiasm not usually available at

any price.
The Senator thought, as we entered the elevator at the first story, that

the accommodation compared very well indeed with anything in his

experience. He had only one criticism—there was no smoking-room. We had

a slight difficulty with momma at the second story—she did not wish to

change her elevator. Inside she said she felt perfectly secure, but the

tower itself she knew must waggle at that height when once you stepped

out. In the end, however, we persuaded her not to go down before she had

made the ascent, and she rose to the top with her eyes shut. When we

finally got out, however, the sight of numbers of young ladies selling

Eiffel Tower mementoes steadied her nerves. She agreed with poppa that

business premises would never let on anything but the most stable basis.
"It's exactly as Bramley said," remarked the Senator. "You're up so high

that the scenery, so far as Paris is concerned, becomes perfectly

ridiculous. It might as well be a map."
"Don't look over, Alexander," said momma. "It will fill you with a

wild desire to throw yourself down. It is said always to have that

effect."
"'The past ends in this plain at your feet,'" quoted poppa critically

from the guide-book, "'the future will there be fulfilled.' I suppose

they did feel a bit uppish when they'd got as high as this—but you'd

think France was about the only republic at present doing business,

wouldn't you?"
I pointed out the Pantheon down below and St. Etienne du Mont, and poppa

was immediately filled with a poignant regret that we had spent so much

time seeing public buildings on foot. "Whereas," said he, "from our

present point of view we could have done them all in ten minutes. As it

is, we shall be in a position to say we've seen everything there is to

be seen in Paris. Bramley won't be able to tell us it's a pity we've

missed anything. However," he continued, "we must be conscientious about

it. I've no desire to play it low down on Bramley. Let us walk round and

pick out the places of interest he's most likely to expect to catch us

on, and look at them separately. I should hate to think I wasn't telling

the truth about a thing like that."
We walked round and specifically observed the "Ecole des Beaux Arts,"

the "Palais d'Industrie," "Liberty Enlightening the World," and other

objects, poppa carefully noting against each of them "seen from Eiffel

Tower." As we made our way to the river side we noticed four other

people, two ladies and two gentlemen, looking at the military balloon

hanging over Meudon. They all had their backs to us, and there was to me

something dissimilarly familiar about three of those backs. While I was

trying to analyse it one of the gentlemen turned, and caught sight of

poppa. In another instant the highest elevation yet made by engineering

skill was the scene of three impetuous American handclasps, and four

impulsive American voices were saying, "Why how do you do!" The

gentleman was Mr. Richard Dod of Chicago, known to our family without

interruption since he wore long clothes. Mr. Dod had come into his

patrimony and simultaneously disappeared in the direction of Europe six

months before, since when we had only heard vaguely that he had lost

most of it, but was inalterably cheerful; and there was nobody,

apparently, he expected so little or desired so much to see in Paris as

the Senator, momma and me. Poppa called him "Dick, my boy," momma called

him "my dear Dicky," I called him plain "Dick," and when this had been

going on for, possibly, five minutes, the older and larger of the two

ladies of the party swung round with a majesty I at once associated with

my earlier London experiences, and regarded us through her pince nez.

There was no mistaking her disapproval. I had seen it before. We were

Americans and she was Mrs. Portheris of Half Moon-street, Piccadilly. I

saw that she recognised me and was trying to make up her mind whether,

in view of the complication of Mr. Dod, to bow or not. But the woman who

hesitates is lost, even though she be a British matron of massive

prejudices and a figure to match. In Mrs. Portheris's instant of

vacillation, I stepped forward with such enthusiasm that she was

compelled to take down her pince nez and hold out a superior hand. I

took it warmly, and turned to my parents with a joy which was not in the

least affected. "Momma," I exclaimed, "try to think of the very last

person who would naturally cross your mind—our relation, Mrs.

Portheris. Poppa, allow me to introduce you to your aunt—Mrs.

Portheris. Your far distant nephew from Chicago, Mr. Joshua Peter Wick.
It was a moment to be remembered—we all said so afterwards. Everything

hung upon Mrs. Portheris's attitude. But it was immediately evident that

Mrs. Portheris considered parents of any kind excusable, even

commendable! Her manner said as much—it also implied, however, that she

could not possibly be held responsible for transatlantic connections by

a former marriage. Momma was nervous, but collected. She bowed a distant

Wastgaggle bow, an heirloom in the family, which gave Mrs. Portheris to

understand that if any cordiality was to characterise the occasion, it

would have to emanate from her. Besides, Mrs. Portheris was poppa's

relation, and would naturally have to be guarded against. Poppa, on the

other hand, was cordiality itself—he always is.
"Why, is that so?" said poppa, looking earnestly at Mrs. Portheris and

firmly retaining her hand. "Is this my very own Aunt Caroline?"
"At one time," responded Mrs. Portheris with a difficult smile, "and, I

fear, by marriage only."
"Ah, to be sure, to be sure! Poor Uncle Jimmy gave place to another. But

we won't say anything more about that. Especially as you've been equally

unfortunate with your second," said poppa sympathetically. "Well, I'm

sure I'm pleased to meet you—glad to shake you by the hand." He gave

that member one more pressure as he spoke and relinquished it.
"It is extremely unlooked for," replied his Aunt Caroline, and looked at

Mr. Dod, who quailed, as if he were in some way responsible for it. "I

confess I am not in the habit of meeting my connections promiscuously

abroad." When we came to analyse the impropriety of this it was

difficult, but we felt as a family very disreputable at the time. Mr.

Dod radiated sympathy for us. Poppa looked concerned.
"The fact is," said he, "we ought to have called on you at your London

residence, Aunt Caroline. And if we had been able to make a more

protracted stay than just about long enough, as you might say, to see

what time it was, we would have done so. But you see how it was."
"Pray don't mention it," said Mrs. Portheris. "It is very unlikely that

I should have been at home."
"Then that's all right," poppa replied with relief.
"London has so many monuments," murmured Dicky Dod, regarding Mrs.

Portheris's impressive back. "It is quite impossible to visit them all."
"The view from here," our relation remarked in a leave-taking tone, "is

very beautiful, is it not?"
"It's very extensive," replied poppa, "but I notice the inhabitants

round about seem to think it embraces the biggest part of civilisation.

I admit it's a good-sized view, but that's what I call enlarging upon

it."
"Come, Mr. Dod," commanded Mrs. Portheris, "we must rejoin the rest of

our party. They are on the other side."
"Certainly," said Dicky. "But you must give me your address, Mrs. Wick.

Thanks. And there now! I've been away from Illinois a good long time,

but I'm not going to forget to congratulate Chicago on getting you once

more into the United States Senate, Mr. Wick. I did what I could in my

humble way, you know."
"I know you did, Richard," returned poppa warmly, "and if there's any

little Consulship in foreign parts that it would amuse you to fill——"
Mrs. Portheris, in the act of exchanging unemotional farewells with

mamma, turned round. "Do I understand that you are now a Senator?" she

inquired. "I had no idea of it. It is certainly a distinction—an

American distinction, of course—but you can't help that. It does you

credit. I trust you will use your influence to put an end to the

Mormons."
"As far as that goes," poppa returned with deprecation, "I believe my

business does take me to the Capitol pretty regularly now. But I'd be

sorry to think any more of myself on that account. Your nephew, Aunt

Caroline, is just the same plain American he was before."
"I hope you will vote to exterminate them," continued Mrs. Portheris

with decision. "Dear me! A Senator—I suppose you must have a great deal

of influence in your own country! Ah, here are the truants! We might all

go down in the lift together."
The truants appeared looking conscious. One of them, when he saw me,

looked astonished as well, and I cannot say that I myself was perfectly

unmoved when I realised that it was Mr. Mafferton! There was no reason

why Mr. Mafferton should not have been at the top of the Eiffel Tower in

the society of Mrs. Portheris, Mr. Dod, and another, that afternoon, but

for the moment it seemed to me uniquely amazing. We shook hands,

however—it was the only thing to do—and Mr. Mafferton said this was

indeed a surprise as if it were the most ordinary thing possible. Mrs.

Portheris looked on at our greeting with an air of objecting to things

she had not been taught to expect, and remarked that she had no idea Mr.

Mafferton was one of my London acquaintances. "But then," she continued

in a tone of just reproach, "I saw so little of you during your season

in town that you might have made the Queen's acquaintance and all the

Royal Family, and I should have been none the wiser."
It was too much to expect of one's momma that she should let an

opportunity like that slip, and mine took hold of it with both hands.
"I believe my daughter did make Victoria's acquaintance, Mrs.

Portheris," said she, "and we were all very pleased about it. Your Queen

has a very good reputation in our country. We think her a wise sovereign

and a perfect lady. I suppose you often go to her Drawing Rooms."
Mrs. Portheris wore the expression of one passing through the Stone Age

to a somewhat more mobile period. "I really think," she said, "I should

have been made aware of that. To have had a young relative presented

without one's knowledge seems too extraordinary. No," she continued,

turning to poppa, "the only thing I heard of this young lady—it came to

me in a very roundabout manner—was that she had gone home to be

married. Was not that your intention?" asked Mrs. Portheris, turning

to me.
"It was," I said. There was nothing else to say.
"Then may I inquire if you fulfilled it?"
"I didn't, Mrs. Portheris," said I. I was very red, but not so red as

Mr. Mafferton. "Circumstances interfered." I was prepared for an inquiry

as to what the circumstances were, and privately made up my mind that

Mrs. Portheris was too distant a relation to be gratified with such

information in the publicity of the Eiffel Tower. But she merely looked

at me with suspicion, and said it was much better that young people

should discover their unsuitability to one another before marriage than

after. "I can conceive nothing more shocking than divorce," said Mrs.

Portheris, and her tone indicated that I had probably narrowly escaped

it.
We were rather a large party as we made our way to the elevator, and I

found myself behind the others in conversation with Dicky Dod. It was a

happiness to come thus unexpectedly upon Dicky Dod—he gave forth all

that is most exhilarating in our democratic civilisation, and he was in

excellent spirits. As the young lady of Mrs. Portheris's party joined us

I thought I found a barometric reading in Mr. Dod's countenance that

explained the situation. "I remember you," she said shyly, and there was

something in this innocent audacity and the blush which accompanied it

that helped me to remember her too. "You came to see mamma in Half

Moon-street once. I am Isabel."
"Dear me!" I replied, "so you are. I remember—you had to go upstairs,

hadn't you. Please don't mind," I went on hastily as Isabel looked

distressed, "you couldn't help it. I was very unexpected, and I might

have been dangerous. How—how you've grown!" I really couldn't think

of anything else to say.
Isabel blushed again, Dicky observing with absorbed adoration. It was

lovely colour. "You know I haven't really," she said, "it's all one's

long frocks and doing up one's hair, you know."
"Miss Portheris only came out two months ago," remarked Mr. Dod, with

the effect of announcing that Venus had just arisen from the foam.
"Come, young people," Mrs. Portheris exclaimed from the lift; "we are

waiting for you." Poppa and momma and Mr. Mafferton were already inside.

Mrs. Portheris stood in the door. As Isabel entered, I saw that Mr. Dod

was making the wildest efforts to communicate something to me with his

left eye.
"Come, young people," repeated Mrs. Portheris.
"Do you think it's safe for so many?" asked Dicky doubtfully. "Suppose

anything should give, you know!"
Mrs. Portheris looked undecided. Momma, from the interior, immediately

proposed to get out.
"Safe as a church," remarked the Senator.
"What do you mean, Dod?" demanded Mr. Mafferton.
"Well, it's like this," said Dicky; "Miss Wick is rather nervous about

overcrowding, and I think it's better to run no risks myself. You all go

down, and we'll follow you next trip. See?"
"I suppose you will hardly allow that, Mrs. Wick," said our relation,

with ominous portent.
"Est ce que vous voulez à déscendre, monsieur?" inquired the official

attached to the elevator, with some impatience.
"I don't see what there is to object to—I suppose it would be safer,"

momma replied anxiously, and the official again demanded if we were

going down.
"Not this trip, thank you," said Dicky, and turned away. Mrs. Portheris,

who had taken her seat, rose with dignity. "In that case," said she, "I

also will remain at the top;" but her determination arrived too late.

With a ferocious gesture the little official shut the door and gave the

signal, and Mrs. Portheris sank earthwards, a vision of outraged

propriety. I felt sorry for momma.
"And now," I inquired of Mr. Dod, "why was the elevator not safe?"
"I'll tell you," said Dicky. "Do you know Mrs. Portheris well?"
"Very slightly indeed," I replied.
"Not well enough to—sort of chum up with our party, I suppose."
"Not for worlds," said I.
Dicky looked so disconsolate that I was touched.
"Still," I said, "you'd better trot out the circumstances, Dicky. We

haven't forgotten what you did in your humble way, you know, at election

time. I can promise for the family that we'll do anything we can. You

mustn't ask us to poison her, but we might lead her into the influenza."
"It's this way," said Mr. Dod. "How remarkably contracted the Place de

la Concorde looks down there, doesn't it! It's like looking through the

wrong end of an opera glass."
"I've observed that," I said. "It won't be fair to keep them waiting

very long down there on the earth, you know, Dicky."
"Certainly not! Well, as I was saying, your poppa's Aunt Caroline is a

perfect fiend of a chaperone. By Jove, Mamie, let's be silhouetted!"
"Poppa was silhouetted," I said, "and the artist turned him out the

image of Senator Frye. Now he doesn't resemble Senator Frye in the least

degree. The elevator is ascending, Richard."
Richard blushed and looked intently at the horizon beyond Montmartre.
"You see, between Miss Portheris and me, it's this way," he began

recklessly, but with the vision before my eyes of momma on the steps

below wanting her tea, I cut him short.
"So far as you are concerned, Dicky, I see the way it is," I interposed

sympathetically. "The question is——"
"Exactly. So it is. About Isabel. But I can't find out. It seems to be

so difficult with an English girl. Doesn't seem to think such a thing as

a—a proposal exists. Now an American girl is just as ready——"
"Richard," I interrupted severely, "the circumstances do not require

international comparisons. By the way, how do you happen to be

travelling with—with Mr. Mafferton?"
"That's exactly where it comes in," Mr. Dod exclaimed luminously. "You'd

think, the way Mafferton purrs round the old lady, he'd been a friend of

the family from the beginning of time! Fact is, he met them two days

before they left London. I had known them a good month, and the

venerable one seemed to take to me considerably. There wasn't a cab she

wouldn't let me call, nor a box at the theatre she wouldn't occupy, nor

a supper she wouldn't try to enjoy. Used to ask me to tea. Inquired

whether I was High or Low. That was awful, because I had to chance it,

being Congregational, but I hit it right—she's Low, too, strong. Isabel

always made the tea out of a canister the old lady kept locked. Singular

habit that, locking tea up in a canister."
"You are wandering, Dicky," I said. "And Isabel used to ask you whether

you would have muffins or brown bread and butter—I know. Go on."
"Girls have intuition," remarked Mr. Dod with a glance of admiration

which I discounted with contempt. "Well, then old Mafferton turned up

here a week ago. Since then I haven't been waltzing in as I did before.

Old lady seems to think there's a chance of keeping the family pure

English—seems to think she'd like it better—see? At least, I take it

that way; he's cousin to a lord," Dick added dejectedly, "and you know

financially I've been coming through a cold season."
"It's awkward," I admitted, "but old ladies of no family are like that

over here. I know Mrs. Portheris is an old lady of no family, because

she's a connection of ours, you see. What about Isabel? Can't you tell

the least bit?"
"How can a fellow? She blushes just as much when he speaks to her as

when I do."
"But are you quite sure," I asked delicately, "whether Mr. Mafferton

is—interested?"
"There's the worst kind of danger of it," Dicky replied impressively. "I

don't know whether I ought to tell you, but the fact is Mafferton's just

got the sack—I beg your pardon—just been congéed himself. They say

she was an American and it was a bad case; she behaved most

unfeelingly."
"You shouldn't believe all you hear," I said, "but I don't see what that

has to do with it."
"Why, he's just in the mood to console himself. What fellow would think

twice of being thrown over, if Miss Portheris were the alternative!"
"It depends, Dicky," I observed. "You are jumping at conclusions."
"What I hoped," he went on regretfully as we took our places in the

elevator, "was that we might travel together a bit and that you wouldn't

mind just now and then taking old Mafferton off our hands, you know."
"Dicky," I said, as we swiftly descended, "here is our itinerary.

Genoa, you see, then Pisa, Rome, Naples, Rome again, Florence, Venice,

Verona, up through the lakes to Switzerland, and so on. We leave

to-morrow. If we should meet again, I don't promise to undertake it

personally, but I'll see what momma can do."
Breakfast with Dicky Dod.
Breakfast with Dicky Dod.

CHAPTER VIII.
Poppa said as we steamed out of Paris that night that the Presidency

itself would not induce him to reside there, and I think he meant it. I

don't know whether the omnibus numeros and the correspondances where

you change, or the men sitting staring on the side walks drinking things

for hours at a time, or getting no vegetables to speak of with his

joint, annoyed him most, but he was very decided in his views. Momma and

I were not quite so certain; we had a guilty sense of ingratitude when

we thought of the creations in the van; but the cobblestones biassed

momma a good deal, who hoped she should get some sleep in Italy. I had

breakfasted that morning in the most amusing way with Dicky Dod at a

café in the Champs Elysées—poppa and momma had an engagement with Mr.

and Mrs. Malt and couldn't come—and in the leniency of the recollection

I said something favourable about the Arc de Triomphe at sunset; but I

gathered from the Senator's remarks that, while the sunset was fine

enough, he didn't see the propriety in using it that way as a background

for Napoleon Bonaparte, so to speak.
"Result is," said the Senator, "the intelligent foreigner's got pretty

nearly to go out of the town to see a sunset without having to think

about Aboukir and Alexandria. But that's Paris all over. There isn't a

street, or a public building, or a statue, or a fountain, or a thing

that doesn't shout at you, 'Look at me! Think about me! Your admiration

or your life!' Those Frenchmen don't mind it because it only repeats

what they're always saying themselves, but if you're a foreigner it gets

on your nerves. That city is too uniformly fine to be of much use to

me—it keeps me all the time wondering why I'm not in one eternal good

humour to match. There's good old London now—always looks, I should

think, just as you feel. Looks like history, too, and change, and

contrast, and the different varieties of the human lot."
"I see what you mean, poppa," I said. "There's too much equality in

Paris, isn't there—to be interesting," but the Senator was too deeply

engaged in getting out momma's smelling salts to corroborate this

interpretation.
It is a very long way to Genoa if you don't stop at Aix-les-Bains or

anywhere—twenty-four hours—but Mont Cenis occurs in the night, which

is suitable in a tunnel. There came a chill through the darkness that

struck to one's very marrow, and we all rose with one accord and groped

about for more rugs. When broad daylight came it was Savoy, and we

realised what we had been through. The Senator was inclined to deplore

missing the realisation of the Mont Cenis, and it was only when momma

said it was a pity he hadn't taken a train that would have brought us

through in the daytime and enabled him to examine it, that he ceased to

express regret. My parents are often vehicles of philosophy for each

other.
Besides, in the course of the morning the Senator acknowledged that he

got more tunnels than he had any idea he had paid for. They came with a

precipitancy that interfered immensely with any connected idea of the

scenery, though momma, in my interest, did her best to form one. "Note,

my love," she said, as we began to penetrate the frontier country, "that

majestic blue summit on the horizon to the left"—obliteration, and

another tunnel! "Don't miss that jagged line of snows just beyond the

back of poppa's head, dear one. Quick! they are melting away!"—but the

next tunnel was quicker. "Put down that the dazzling purity of these

lovely peaks must be realised, for it cannot be"—darkness, and the

blight of another tunnel. It was very hard on momma's imagination, and

she finally accepted the Senator's warning that it would be thrown

completely out of gear if she went on, and abandoned the attempt to form

complete sentences between tunnels. It was much simpler to exclaim

"Splendid!" or "Glorious!" which one could generally do without being

interrupted.
We were not prepared to enjoy anything when we arrived at Genoa, but

there was Christopher Columbus in bronze, just outside the station in a

little place by himself, and we felt bound to give him our attention

before we went any further. He was patting America on the head, both of

them life size, and carrying on that historical argument with his

sailors in bas-relief below; and he looked a very fine character. As

poppa said, he was just the man you would pick out to discover America.

The Senator also remarked that you could see from the position of the

statue, right there in full view of the travelling public, that the

Genoese thought a lot of Columbus; relied upon him, in fact, as their

biggest attraction. Momma examined him from the carriage. She said it

was most gratifying to see him there in his own home, so to speak; but

her enthusiasm did not induce her to get out. Momma's patriotism has

always to be considered in connection with the state of her nerves.
The state of all our nerves was healed in a quarter of an hour. The

Senator showed his coupons somewhat truculently, but they were received

as things of price with disarming bows and real gladness. We were led

through rambling passages into lofty white chambers, with marble floors

and iron bedsteads, full of simplicity and cleanliness, where we removed

all recollections of Paris without being obliged to consider a stuffy

carpet or satin-covered furniture. Italy, in the persons of the

portier and the chambermaid, laid hold of us with intelligible smiles,

and we were charmed. Inside, the place was full of long free lines and

cool polished surfaces, and pleasant curves. Outside, a thick-fronded

palm swayed in the evening wind against a climbing hill of many-tinted,

many-windowed houses, in all the soft colours we knew of before. When

the portier addressed momma as "Signora" her cup of bliss ran over,

and she made up her mind that she felt able, after all, to go down to

dinner.
Remembering their sentiments, we bowed as slightly as possible when we

saw the Miss Binghams across the table, and the Senator threw that into

his voice, as he inquired how they liked la belle Italie so far, and

whether they had had any trouble with their trunks coming in, which

might have given them to understand that his politeness was very

perfunctory. If they perceived it, they allowed it to influence them the

other way, however. They asked, almost as cordially as if we were

middle-class English people, whether we had actually survived that trip

to Versailles, and forbore to comment when we said we had enjoyed it,

beyond saying that if there was one enviable thing it was the American

capacity for pleasure. Yet one could see quite plainly that the vacuum

caused by the absence of the American capacity for pleasure was filled

in their case by something very superior to it.
"This city new to you?" asked the Senator as the meal progressed.
"In a sense, yes," replied Miss Nancy Bingham.
"We've never studied it before," said Miss Cora.
"I suppose it has a fascination all its own," remarked momma.
"Oh, rather!" exclaimed Miss Nancy Bingham, and I reflected that when

she was in England she must have seen a great deal of school-boy

society. I decided at once, noting its effect upon the lips of a

middle-aged maiden lady, that momma must not be allowed to pick up the

expression.
"It's simply full of associations of old families—the Dorias, the

Pallavicinis, the Durazzos," remarked Miss Cora. "Do you gloat on the

medieval?"
"We're perfectly prepared to," said the Senator. "I believe we've got

both Murray and Baedeker for this place. Now do you commit your facts to

memory before going to bed the night previous, or do you learn them up

as you go along?"
"Oh," said Miss Nancy Bingham, "we are of the opinion that one should

always visit these places with a mind prepared. Though I myself have no

objection to carrying a guide-book, provided it is covered with brown

paper."
"Then you acquire it all beforehand," commented the Senator. "That, I

must say, is commendable of you. And it's certainly the only

business-like way of proceeding. The amount of time a person loses

fooling over Baedeker on the spot——"
"One of us does," acknowledged Miss Nancy. "We take it in turns. And I

must say it is generally my sister." And she turned to Miss Cora, who

blushed and said, "How can you, Nancy!"
"And you use her, for that particular public building or historic

scene, as a sort of portable, self-acting reference library," remarked

poppa. "That's an idea that commends itself to me, daughter, in

connection with you."
I was about to reply in terms of deprecation, when a confusion of sound

drifted in from the street, of arriving cabs and expostulating voices.

The Miss Binghams looked at each other in consternation and said with

one accord, "It was the Fulda!"
"Was it?" inquired poppa. "Do you refer to the German Lloyd steamship of

that name?"
"We do," said Miss Nancy. "About an hour ago we were sure we saw her

steaming into the harbour."
"She comes from New York, I suppose," momma remarked.
"She does indeed," said Miss Nancy, "and she's been lying at the docks

unloading Americans ever since she arrived. And here they are. Cora,

have you finished?"
Cora said she had, and without further parley the ladies rose and

rustled away. Their invading fellow-countrymen gratefully took their

places, and the Senator sent a glance of scorn after them strong enough

to make them turn round. After dinner, we saw a collection of cabin

trunks and valises standing in the entrance hall labelled BINGHAM,

and knew that Miss Nancy and Miss Cora were again in flight before the

Nemesis of the American Eagle. I will not repeat poppa's sentiments.
On the hotel doorstep next morning waited Alessandro Bebbini. He waited

for us—an hour and a half, because momma had some re-packing to do and

we were going on next day. Nobody had asked him to wait, but he had a

carriage ready and the look of having been ordered three months

previously. He presented his card to the Senator, who glanced at him and

said, "Do I look as if I wanted a shave?"
Alessandro Bebbini smiled—an olive flash of pity and amusement. "I make

not the shava, Signore," he said, "I am the courier—for your kind

dispositione I am here."
"You should never judge foreigners by their appearance, Alexander,"

rebuked momma.
"Well, Mr. Bebbini," said the Senator, "I guess I've got to apologise to

you. You see they told me inside there that I should probably find a—a

tonsorial artist out here on the steps"—poppa never minds telling a

story to save people's feelings. "But you haven't convinced me," he

continued, "that I've got any use for a courier."
"You wish see Genoa—is it not?"
"Well, yes," replied the Senator, "it is."
"Then with me you come alonga. I will translate you the city—shoppia,

pallass—w'at you like. Also I am not dear man neither. In the season

yes. Then I am very dear. But now is nobody."
"What does your time cost to buy?" demanded poppa.
"Very cheap price. Two francs one hour. Ten francs one day. But if with

you I travel, make arrangimento, you und'stan', look for traina—'otel,

biglietto, bagaglia—then I am so little you laugh. Two 'undred franc

the month!" and Alessandro indicated with every muscle of his body the

amazement he expected us to feel.
The Senator turned to the ladies of his family. "Now that I think of

it," he said, "travels in Italy are never written without a courier.

People wouldn't believe they were authentic. And Bramley said if you

really wanted to enjoy yourself it was folly not to engage one."
"I suppose there's more choice in the season," said momma, glancing

disapprovingly at Alessandro's swarthy collar. "And I confess I should

have expected them to be garbed more picturesquely."
"Look at his language," I remarked. "You can't have everything."
The Senator said that was so. "I believe you can come along, Mr.

Bebbini," he said; "we're strangers here and we'll get you to help us to

enjoy ourselves for a month on the terms you name. You can begin right

away."
Alessandro bowed and waved us to the carriage. It was only the ordinary

commercial bow of Italy, but I could see that it made a difference to

momma. He saw us seated and was climbing on the box when poppa

interfered. "There's no use trying to work it that way," he said; "we

can't ask you to twist your head off every time you emit a piece of

information. Besides, there's no sense in your riding on the box when

there's an extra seat. You won't crowd us any, Mr. Bebbini, and I guess

we can refrain from discussing family matters for one hour."
So we started, with Mr. Bebbini at short range.
"I think," said he, "you lika first off the 'ouse of Cristoforo

Colombo."
"I don't see how you knew," said poppa, "but you are perfectly correct.

Cristoforo was one of the most distinguished Americans on the roll of

history, and we, also, are Americans. At once, at once to the habitation

of Cristoforo."
Alessandro leaned forward impressively.
"Who informa you Cristoforo Colombo was Americano? Better you don't

believe these other guide—ignoranta fella. Cristoforo was Genoa man,

born here, you und'stan'? Italiano. Only live in America a lill'

w'ile—to discover, you und'stan'?"
"Mr. Bebbini," said poppa, "if you go around contradicting Americans on

the subject of Christopher Columbus your business will decrease. As a

matter of fact, Christopher wasn't born, he was made, and America made

him. He has every right to claim to be considered an American, and it

was a little careless of him not to have founded a family there. We make

excuses for him—it's quite true he had very little time at his

disposal—but we feel it, the whole nation of us, to this day."
The Via Balbi was cheerfully crooked and crowded, it had the modern

note of the street car, and the mediæval one of old women, arms akimbo,

in the nooks and recesses, selling big black cherries and bursting figs.

Even the old women though, as momma complained, wore postilion basques

and bell skirts, certainly in an advanced stage of usefulness, but of

unmistakable genesis—just what had been popular in Chicago a year or

two before.
"Really, my love," said momma, "I don't know what we shall do for

description in Genoa, the people seem to wear no clothes worth

mentioning whatever." We concluded that all the city's characteristically

Italian garments were in the wash; they depended in novel cut and colour

from every window that did not belong to a bank or a university; and

sometimes, when the side street was narrow and the houses high, the effect

was quite imposing. Poppa asked Alessandro Bebbini whether they were

expecting royalty or anything, or whether it was like this every washing

day, and we gathered that there was nothing unusual about it. But poppa

said I had better mention it so that people might be prepared. Personally,

I rather liked the display, it gave such unexpected colour and incident to

those high-shouldering, narrow by-ways we looked down into from the upper

level of the Via Balbi, where only here and there the sun strove through,

and all the rest was a rich toned mystery; but there may be others like

momma, who prefer the clothes line of the Occident and the privacy of the

back yard.
The two sides of the Via Poverina almost touched foreheads. "Yes,"

said Alessandro Bebbini apologetically, "it is a ver' tight street."
Poppa was extremely pleased with the appearance of the house of

Christopher Columbus, which Alessandro pointed out in the Via Assorotti.

It was a comfortable looking edifice, with stone giants supporting the

arch of the doorway, in every respect suitable as the residence of a

retired navigator of distinction. Poppa said it was very gratifying to

find that Cristoforo had been able, in his declining years, when he was

our only European representative, to keep his end up with credit to

America.
You so often found the former abodes of glorious names with a modern

rental out of all proportion with their historic interest. This house,

poppa calculated, would let to-day at a figure discreditable neither to

Cristoforo himself, nor to the United States of America. Mr. Bebbini,

unfortunately, could not tell him what that figure was.
On the steps of San Lorenzo Cathedral momma paused and cast a searching

glance into all the corners.
"Where are the beggars?" she inquired, not without injury. "I have

always been given to understand that church entrances in Italy were

disgracefully thronged with beggars of the lowest type. I have never

seen a picture of a sacred building without them!"
"So that was why you wanted so much small change, Augusta," said the

Senator. "Mr. Bebbini says there's a law against them nowadays. Now that

you mention it, I'm disappointed there too. Municipal progress in Italy

is something you've not prepared for somehow. I daresay if we only knew

it, they're thinking of lighting this town with electricity, and the

Board of Aldermen are considering contracts for cable cars."
"Do not inquire, Alexander," begged momma, but the Senator had fallen

behind with Mr. Bebbini in earnest conversation, and we gathered that

its import was entirely modern.
It was our first Italian church and it was impressive, for a President

of the French Republic had just fallen to the knife of an Italian

assassin, and from the altar to the door San Lorenzo was in mourning and

in penance. Masses for his soul's repose had that day been said and

sung; near the door hung a request for the prayers of all good

Christians to this end. Many of the grave-eyed people that came and went

were doubtless about this business, but one, I know, was there on a

private errand. He prayed at a chapel aside, kneeling on the floor

beside the railings, his cap in his hands, grasping it just as the

peasant in The Angelus grasps his. Inside the altar hung a picture of a

pitying woman, and there were candles and foolish flowers of tinsel, but

beside these, many tokens of hearts, gold and silver, thick below the

altar, crowding the partition walls. The hearts were grateful

ones—Alessandro explained in an undertone—brought and left by many

who had been preserved from violent death by the saint there, and he who

knelt was a workman just from hospital, who had fallen, with his son,

from a building. The boy had been killed, the father only badly hurt.

His heart token was the last—a little common thing—and tied with no

rejoiceful ribbon but with a scrap of crape. I hoped Heaven would see

the crape as well as the tribute. When we went away he was still

kneeling in his patched blue cotton clothes, and as the saint had very

beautiful kind eyes, and all the tinsel flowers were standing in the

glowing light of stained glass, and the voice of the Church had begun to

speak too, through the organ, I daresay he went away comforted.
Momma says there is only one thing she recollects clearly about San

Lorenzo, and that is the Chapel of St. John the Baptist. This does not

remain in her memory because of the Cinquecento screen or the

altar-canopy's porphyry pillars which we know we must have seen because

the guide-book says they are there, but because of the fact that Pope

Innocent the Eighth had it closed to our sex for a long time, except on

one day of the year, on account of Herodias. Momma considered this

extremely invidious of Innocent the Eighth, and said it was a thing no

man except a Pope would have thought of doing. What annoyed poppa was

that she seemed to hold Alessandro Bebbini responsible, and covered him

with reproaches, in the guise of argument, which he neither deserved nor

understood. And when poppa suggested that she was probably as much to

blame for Herodias's conduct as Mr. Bebbini was for the Pope's, she said

that had nothing whatever to do with it, and she thanked Heaven she was

born a Protestant anyway, distinctly implying that Herodias was a Roman

Catholic. And if poppa didn't wish her back to give out altogether,

would he please return to the carriage.
We wandered through a palace or two and thought how interesting it must

have been to be rich in the days of "Sir Horatio Palavasene, who robbed

the Pope to pay the Queen." Wealth had its individuality in those days,

and expressed itself with truth and splendour in sculpture, and picture,

and tapestry, and precious things, with the picturesqueness of contrast

and homage. As the Senator said, a banquet hall did not then suggest a

Fifth Avenue hairdresser's saloon. But now the Genoese merchant-princes

would find that their state had lost its identity in machine made

imitations, and that it would be more distinguished to be poor, since

poverty is never counterfeited. But poppa declined to go as far as that.
Alessandro, as we drove round and up the winding roads that take one to

the top of Genoa—the hotels and the palaces and the churches are mostly

at the bottom—was full of joyous and rapid information. Especially did

he continue to be communicative on the subject of Christopher Columbus,

and if we are not now assured of the school that discoverer attended in

his youth, and the altar rails before which he took the first communion

of his early manhood, and the occupation of his wife's parents, and

many other matters concerning him, it is the fault of history and not

that of Alessandro Bebbini. After a cathedral and a palace and a long

drive, this was bound to have its effect, and I very soon saw resentment

in the demeanour of both my parents. So much so, that when we passed the

family group in memory of Mazzini, and Alessandro explained dramatically

that "the daughter he sitta down and cryo because his father is a-dead,"

poppa said, "Is that so?" without the faintest show of excitement, and

momma declined even to look round.
It was not until the evening, however, when we were talking to some

Milwaukee people, that we remembered, with the assistance of Baedeker

and the Milwaukee people, a number of facts about Columbus that deprived

Alessandro's information of its commercial value, while leaving his

ingenuity, so to speak, at par. The Senator was so much annoyed, as he

had made a special note of the state of preservation in which he had

found the dwelling of our discoverer, that he had recourse to the most

unscrupulous means of relieving us of Alessandro—who was to present

himself next morning at eleven. He wrote an impulsive letter to "A.

Bebbini, Esq.," which ran:

"SIR: I find that we are too credulous a family to travel in

safety with a courier. When you arrive at the hotel to-morrow,

therefore, you will discover that we have fled by an earlier train. We

take it from no personal objection to your society, but from a rooted

and unconquerable objection to brass facts. I enclose your month's

salary and a warning that any attempt to follow me will be fruitless and

expensive."
"Yours truly,"
"J.P. WICK."
The Senator assured me afterwards that this was absolutely

necessary—that A. Bebbini, if we introduced him in any quantity, would

ruin the sale of our work, and if he accompanied us it would be

impossible to keep him out. He said we ought to apologize for having

even mentioned him in a book of travels which we hope to see taken

seriously. And we do.

CHAPTER IX.
Momma wishes me to state that the word Italy, in any language, will for

ever be associated in her mind with the journey from Genoa to Pisa. We

had our own lunch basket, so no baneful anticipation of cutlets fried in

olive oil marred the perfect satisfaction with which we looked out of

the windows. One window, almost the whole way, opened on a low

embankment which seemed a garden wall. Olives and lemon trees grew

beyond it and dropped over, and it was always dipping in the sunlight to

show us the roses and the shady walks of the villas inside, white and

remote; now and then we saw the pillared end of a verandah or a plaster

Neptune ruling a restricted fountain area. Out of the other window

stretched the blue Gulf of Genoa all becalmed and smiling, with freakish

little points and headlines, and here and there the white blossom of a

sail. The Senator counted eighty tunnels—he wants that fact mentioned

too—some of them so short that it was like shutting one's eyes for an

instant on the olives and the sea. Nevertheless it was an idyllic

journey, and at four o'clock in the afternoon we saw the Leaning Tower

from afar, describing the precise angle that it does in the illustrated

geographies. Momma was charmed to recognise it, she blew it a kiss of

adulation and acclaim, while we yet wound about among the environs, and

hailed it "Pisa!" It was as if she bowed to a celebrity, with the homage

due.
What the Senator called our attention to as we drove to the hotel was

the conspicuous part in municipal politics played by that little old

brown river Arno. In most places the riparian feature of the landscape

is not insisted on—you have usually to go to the suburbs to find it,

but in Pisa it is a sort of main street, with the town sitting

comfortably and equally on each side of it looking on. Momma and I both

liked the idea of a river in town scenery, and thought it might be

copied with advantage in America, it afforded such a good excuse for

bridges. Pisa's three arched stone ones made a reason for settling there

in themselves in our opinion. The Senator, however, was against it on

conservancy grounds, and asked us what we thought of the population of

Pisa. And we had to admit that for the size of the houses there weren't

very many people about. The Lungarno was almost empty except for

desolate cabmen, and they were just as eager and hospitable to us and

our trunks as they had been in Genoa.
In the Piazza del Duomo we expected the Cathedral, the Leaning Tower,

the Baptistry, and the Campo Santo. We did not expect Mrs. Portheris; at

least, neither of my parents did—I knew enough about Dicky Dod not to

be surprised at any combination he might effect. There they all were in

the middle of the square bit of meadow, apparently waiting for us, but

really, I have no doubt, getting an impression of the architecture as a

whole. I could tell from Mrs. Portheris's attitude that she had

acknowledged herself to be gratified. Strange to relate, her

gratification did not disappear when she saw that these mediæval

circumstances would inconsistently compel her to recognise very modern

American connections. She approached us quite blandly, and I saw at once

that Dicky Dod had been telling her that poppa's chances for the

Presidency were considered certain, that the Spanish Infanta had stayed

with us while she was in Chicago at the Exhibition, and that we fed her

from gold plate. It was all in Mrs. Portheris's manner.
"Another unexpected meeting!" she exclaimed. "My dear Mrs. Wick, you

are looking worn out! Try my sal volatile—I insist!" and in the

general greeting momma was seen to back violently away from a long

silver bottle in every direction. Poppa had to interfere. "If it's all

the same to you, Aunt Caroline," he said, "Mrs. Wick is quite as usual,

though I think the Middle Agedness of this country is a little trying

for her at this time of year. She's just a little upset this morning by

seeing the cook plucking a rooster down in the backyard before he'd

killed it. The rooster was in great affliction, you see, and the way he

crowed got on momma's nerves. She's been telling us about it ever since.

But we hope it will pass off."
Mrs. Portheris expanded into that inevitable British story of the

officer who reported of certain tribes that they had no manners and

their customs were abominable, and I, at a mute invitation from Dicky,

stepped aside to get the angle of the Tower from a better point of view.
Mr. Dod was depressed, so much so that he came to the point at once. "I

hope you had a good time in Genoa," he said. "We should have been there

now, only I knew we should never catch up to you if we didn't skip

something. So I heard of a case of cholera there, and didn't mention

that it was last year. Quite enough for Her Ex. I say, though—it's no

use."
"Isn't it?" said I. "Are you sure?"
"Pretty confoundedly certain. The British lion's getting there, in great

shape—the brute. All the widow's arranging. With the widow it's 'Mr.

Dod, you will take care of me, won't you?' or 'Come now, Mr. Dod, and

tell me all about buffalo shooting on your native prairies'—and Mr. Dod

is a rattled jay. There's something about the mandate of a middle-aged

British female."
"I should think there was!" I said.
"Then Maffy, you see, walks in. They don't seem to have much

conversation—she regularly brightens up when I come along and say

something cheerful—but he's gradually making up his mind that the best

isn't any too good for him."
"Perhaps we don't begin so well in America," I interrupted

thoughtfully. "But then, we don't develop into Mrs. P.'s either."
Dicky seemed unable to follow my line of thought. "I must say," he went

on resentfully, "I like—well, just a smell of constancy about a man.

A fellow that's thrown over ought to be in about the same shape as a

widower. But not much Maffy. I tried to work up his feelings over the

American girl the other night—he was as calm!"
"Dicky," said I, "there are subjects a man must keep sacred. You must

not speak to Mr. Mafferton of his first—attachment again. They never do

it in England, except for purposes of fiction."
"Well, I worked that racket all I knew. I even told him that American

girls as often as not changed their minds."
"Richard! He will think I—what will he think of American girls! It

was excessively wrong of you to say that—I might almost call it

criminal!"
Dicky looked at me in pained surprise. "Look here, Mamie," he said, "a

fellow in my fix, you know! Don't get excited. How am I going to confide

in you unless you keep your hair on!"
"What, may I ask, did Mr. Mafferton say when you told him that?" I asked

sternly.
"He said—now you'll be madder than ever. I won't tell you."
"Mr. Dod—Dicky, haven't we been friends from infancy!"
"Played with the same rattle. Cut our teeth together."
"Well then——"
"Well then," he said, "do you mind putting your parasol straight? I like

to see the person I'm talking to, and besides the sun is on the other

side. He said he didn't think it was a privilege that should be extended

to all cases."
"He did, did he?" I rejoined calmly. "That's like the British—isn't

it?"
"It would have made such a complication if I'd kicked him," confessed

Mr. Dod.
The Senator, momma, and Mrs. Portheris stood in the cathedral door.

Isabel and Mr. Mafferton occupied the middle distance. Mr. Mafferton

stooped to add a poppy to a slender handful of wild flowers he held out

to her. Isabel was looking back.
"It will be pleasant inside the Duomo," I said. "Let us go on. I feel

warm. I agree with you that the situation is serious, Dicky. Look at

those poppies! When an Englishman does that you may make up your mind to

the worst. But I don't think anybody need have the slightest respect for

the affections of Mr. Mafferton."
Inside the Duomo it was pleasant, and cool, and there was a dim

religious light that gave one an opportunity for reflection. I was so

much engaged in reflection that I failed to notice the shape of the

Duomo, but I have since learned that it was a basilica, in the form of

a Latin cross, and was simply full of things which should have claimed

my attention. Momma took copious notes from which I see that the Madonna

and Child holy water basin was perfectly sweet, and the episcopal throne

by Uervellesi in 1536 was the finest piece of tarsia work in the world,

and the large bronze hanging lamp by Vincenzo Possento was the object

which assisted Galileo to invent the oscillations of the pendulum. The

Senator was much taken with the inlaid wooden stalls in the choir, the

subjects were so lively. He and his Aunt Caroline nearly came to words

over a monkey regarding its reflection in a looking glass, done with a

realism which Mrs. Portheris considered little short of profane, but

which poppa found quite an excusable filip to devotions which must have

been such an all day business in the sixteenth century. Outside,

however, poppa found it difficult to approve the façade. To throw four

galleries over the street door, he said, with no visible means of

getting into them or possible object for sitting there, was about the

most ridiculous waste of building space he had yet observed.
"But then," said Dicky Dod, who kept his disconsolate place by my side,

"they didn't seem to know how to waste enough in those pre-elevator

days. Look at the pictures and the bronzes and the marble columns inside

there—ten times as much as they had any use for. They just heaped it

up."
"That's so, Dicky, my boy," replied poppa; "we could cover more ground

with the money in our century. But you've got to remember that they

hadn't any other way worth mentioning of spending the taxes. Religion,

so to speak, was the boss contractor's only line."
Dicky remarked that it had to be admitted he worked it on the square,

and momma said that no doubt people built as well as they knew how at

that time, but nothing should induce her to add her weight to the top of

the Leaning Tower.
"It is very remarkable and impressive," said momma, "the idea of its

hanging over that way all these centuries, just on the drop and never

dropping, but who knows that it may not come down this very day!"
"My dear niece, if I may call you so," remarked Mrs. Portheris urbanely,

"it was thus that the builders designed this great monument to stand; in

its inclination lies the triumph of their art."
"I can't say I agree with you there, Aunt Caroline," said poppa; "that

tower was never meant to stand crooked. It's a very serious defect, and

if it happened nowadays, it would justify any Municipal Board in

repudiating the contract. Even those fellows, you see, were too sick to

go on with it, in every case. Begun by Bonanus 1174. Bonanus saw what

was going to happen and gave it up at the third storey. Then Benenato

had his show, got it up to four, and quit, 1203. The next architect

was—let me see—William of Innsbruck. He put on a couple more, and by

that time it began to look dangerous. But nothing happened from 1260 to

1350, and it struck Tomaso Pisano that nothing would happen. He risked

it anyhow, ran up another storey, put the roof on, and came in for the

credit of the whole miracle. I expect Tomaso is at the bottom of that

idea of yours, Aunt Caroline. He would naturally give the reporters that

view."
Mrs. Portheris listened with a tolerance as badly put on as any garment

she was wearing. "I do not usually make assertions," she said when poppa

had finished, "without being convinced of the facts," and I became aware

for the first time that her upper lip wore a slight moustache.
"Well, you'll excuse me, Aunt Caroline——"
"All my life I have heard of the Leaning Tower of Pisa as a feat of

architecture," replied his Aunt Caroline firmly. "I do not propose to

have that view disturbed now."
"Perhaps it was so, my dear love," put in momma deprecatingly, and Mr.

Dod, with a frenzied wink at poppa, called his attention to the

ridiculous Pisan habit of putting immovable fringed carriage-tops on

cabs.
"It undoubtedly was," said Mrs. Portheris, with an embattled front.
"But—Great Scott, aunt!" exclaimed poppa, recklessly, "think what this

place was like—all marsh, with the sea right alongside; not four miles

off as it is now. Why, you couldn't base so much as a calculation on

it!"
"I must say," said Mrs. Portheris in severe surprise, "I knew that

America had made great advances in the world of invention, but I did not

expect to find what looks much like jealousy of the achievements of an

older civilisation."
The Senator looked at his aunt, then he put his hat further back on his

head and cleared his throat. I prepared for the worst, and the worst

would undoubtedly have come if Dicky Dod had not suddenly remembered

having seen a man with a foreign telegram looking for somebody in the

Cathedral.
"It's a feat!" reiterated Mrs. Portheris as the Senator left us in

pursuit of the man with the telegram.
"It's fourteen feet," cried the Senator from a safe distance, "out of

the perpendicular!" and left us to take the consequences.

CHAPTER X.
When momma reported to me Mrs. Portheris's proposition that we should

make the rest of our Continental trip as one undivided party, I found it

difficult to understand.
"These sudden changes of temperature," I remarked, "are trying to the

constitution. Why this desire for the society of three unabashed

Americanisms like ourselves?"
"That's just what I wondered," said momma. "For you can see that she

is full of insular prejudice against our great country. She makes no

attempt to disguise it."
"She never did," I assented.
"She said it seemed so extraordinary—quite providential—meeting

relatives abroad in this way," momma continued, "and she thought we

ought to follow it up."
"Are we going to?" I inquired.
"My goodness gracious no, love! There are some things my nerves cannot

stand the strain of, and one of them is your poppa's Aunt Caroline. The

Senator smoothed it over. He said he was sure we were very much

obliged, but our time was limited, and he thought we could get around

faster alone."
"Well," I said, "I do not understand it, unless Dicky has persuaded her

that poppa is to be our next ambassador to St. James's."
"She was too silly about Dicky," said momma. "She said she really was

afraid, before you appeared, that young Mr. Dod was conceiving an

attachment for her Isabel, whose affections lay quite in another

direction; but now her mind was entirely at rest. I don't remember her

words, she uses so many, but she was trying to hint that poor Dicky was

an admirer of yours, dearest."
"I fancy she succeeded—as far as that goes," I remarked.
"Well, yes, she made me understand her. So I felt obliged to tell her

that, though Dicky was a lovely fellow and we were all very fond of him,

anything of that kind was out of the question."
"And what," I asked, "was her reply to that?"
"She seemed to think I was prevaricating. She said she knew what a

mother's hopes and fears were. They seem to take a very low view," added

momma austerely, "of friendship between a young man and a young woman in

England!"
"I should think so!" said I absent-mindedly. "Dicky hasn't made love to

me for three years."
"What!"
"Nothing, momma, dear," I replied kindly. "Only I wouldn't contradict

Mrs. Portheris again upon that point, if I were you. She will think it

so improper if Dicky isn't my admirer, don't you see?"
But Mrs. Portheris's desire to join our party stood revealed. Her

constant chaperonage of Dicky was getting a little trying, and she

wanted me to relieve her. I felt so deeply for them both, reflecting

upon the situation, that I experienced quite a glow of virtue at the

thought of my promise to Dicky to stay in Rome till his party arrived.

They were going to Siena—why, Mr. Dod could not undertake to

explain—he had never heard of anything cheerful in connection with

Siena.
"My idea is," said the Senator, "that in Rome"—we were on our way

there—"we'll find our work cut out for us. Think of the objects of

interest involved from Romulus and Remus down to the present Pope!"
"I should like my salts before I begin," said momma, pathetically.
"Over two thousand years," continued the Senator impressively, "and

every year you may be sure has left its architectural imprint."
"Does Baedeker say that, Senator?" I asked, with a certain severity.
"No, the expression is entirely my own; you may take it down and use it

freely. Two thousand years of remains is what we've got before us in

Rome, and pretty well scattered too—nothing like the convenience of

Pisa. I expect we shall have to allow at least four days for it. That

Piazza del Duomo," continued poppa, thoughtfully, "seems to have been

laid out with a view to the American tourist of the future. But I don't

suppose that kind of forethought is common."
"How exquisite it was, that cluster of white marble relics of the past

on the bosom of dusky Pisa. It reminded me," said momma, poetically, "of

an old maid's pearls."
"I should suggest," said the Senator to me, "that you make a note of

that. A little sentiment won't do us any harm—just a little. And they

are like an old maid's pearls in connection with that middle-aged,

one-horse little city. Or I should say a widow's—Pisa was once a bride

of the sea. A grass widow's," improved the Senator. "It's all

meadow-land round there—did you notice?"
"I did not," I said coldly; "but, of course, if I'm to call Pisa a grass

widow, it will have to be. Although I warn you, poppa, that in case of

any critic being able to arise and indicate that it is laid out in

oyster beds, I shall make it plain that the responsibility is yours."
We were speeding through Tuscany, and the vine-garlanded trees in the

orchards clasped hands and danced along with us. The sky would have told

us we were in Italy if we had come on a magic carpet without a compass

or a time-table. Poppa says we are not, under any circumstances, to

mention it more than once, but that we might as well explode the fallacy

that there is anything like it in America. There isn't. Our cerulean is

very beautifully blue, but in Italy one discovers by contrast that it

is an intellectual blue, filled with light, high, provocative. The sky

that bends over Tuscany is the very soul of blue, deep, soft, intense,

impenetrable—the sky that one sees in those little casual bits of

landscape behind the shoulders of pre-Raphaelite Saints and Madonnas;

and here and there a lake, giving it back with delight, and now and then

the long slope of a hill, with an old yellow-walled town creeping up,

castle crowned, and raggedly trimmed with olives; and so many ruins that

the Senator, summoned by momma to look at the last in view, regarded it

with disparagement, which he did not attempt to conceal. He wondered, he

said, that the Italian Government wasn't ashamed of having such a lot of

them. They might be picturesque, but they weren't creditable; they gave

you the impression that the country was on the down grade. "You needn't

call my attention to any more of them, Augusta," he added; "but if you

see any building that looks like progress, now, anything that gives you

the idea of modern improvements inside, I shouldn't like to miss it."

And he returned to the thirty-second page of the Sunday New York

World.
"I sometimes wish," said momma, "that I were not the only person in this

family with the artistic temperament."
Sometimes we stopped at the little yellow towns and saw quite closely

their queer old defences and belfrys and clock towers, and guessed at

the pomegranates and oleanders behind their high courtyard walls. They

had musical names, even in the mouths of the railway guards, who sang

every one of them with a high note and a full octave on the syllable of

stress—"Rosignano!" "Carmiglia!" The Senator was fascinated with

the spectacle of a railway guard who could express himself intelligibly,

to say nothing of the charm; he spoke of introducing the system in the

United States, but we tried it on "New York," "Washington," "Kansas

City," and it didn't seem the same.
It was at Orbatello, I think, that we made the travelling acquaintance

of the enterprising little gentleman to whom momma still mysteriously

alludes as "il capitano." He bowed ceremoniously as he entered the

carriage and stowed the inevitable enormous valise in the rack, and his

eye brightened intelligently as he saw we were a family of American

tourists. He wore a rather seamy black uniform and a soft felt hat with

cocks' feathers drooping over it, and a sword and a ridiculously amiable

expression for a man. I don't think he was five feet high, but his

moustache and his feathers and his sword were out of all proportion.

There was a gentle trustful exuberance about him which suggested that,

although it was possibly twenty-five years since he was born, his age

was much less than that. He twirled his moustache in voluble silence for

ten minutes while we all furtively scrutinised him with the curiosity

inspired by a foreigner of any size, and then with a smile of conscious

sweetness he asked the Senator if he might take the liberty to give the

trouble to see the English newspaper for a few seconds only. "I should

be too thankful," he added.
"Why certainly," said poppa, much gratified. "I see you spikkum

English," he added encouragingly.
"I speak—um, si. I have learned some—a few of them. But O very

baddili I speak them!"
"I guess that's just your modesty," said poppa kindly. "But that's not

an English paper, you know—it's published in New York."
"Ah!" he exclaimed with enthusiasm. "That will be much much the more

pleasurable for me." His eyes shone with feeling. "In Italy," he added

with an impulsive gesture, "we love the American peoples beyond the

Londonian. We always remember that it was an Italian, Cristoforo

Col——"
"I know," said poppa. "Very nice of you. But what's your reason now, for

preferring Americans as a nation?"
We saw our first Italian shrug. It is more prolonged, more sentimental

than French ones. In this case it expressed the direct responsibility of

Fate.
"I think," he said, "that they are more simpatica—sympatheticated to

us." He seemed to be unaware of me, but his eye rested upon momma at

this point, and took her into his confidence.
"We also," said she reciprocally, "are always charmed to see Italians in

our country."
I wondered privately whether she was thinking of hand organ men or

members of the Mafia society, but it was no opportunity to inquire. My

impression is that about this time, in spite of Tuscany outside, I went

to sleep, because my next recollection is of the little Captain pouring

Chianti out of a large black bottle into momma's jointed silver

travelling cup. I remember thinking when I saw that, that they must have

made progress. Scraps of conversation floated through my waking moments

when the train stopped—I heard momma ask him if his parents were both

living and where his home was. I also understood her to inquire whether

the Italians were domestic in their tastes or whether they were like the

French, who, she believed, had no home life at all. I saw the Senator

put a card in his pocket-book and restore it to his breast, and heard

him inquire whether his new Italian acquaintance wore his uniform every

day as a matter of choice or because he had to. An hour went by, and

when I finally awoke it was to see momma sitting by with folded hands

and an expression of much gratification while poppa gave a graphic

account of the rise and progress of the American baking-powder interest.

"I don't expect," said he, "you've ever heard of Wick's Electric

Corn-flour?"
"It is my misfortune."
"We sent thousands of cans to Southern Europe last year, sir. Or Wick's

Sublimated Soda?"
"I am stupidissimo."
"No, not at all. But I daresay your momma knows it, if she ever has

waffles on her breakfast table. Well, it's been a kind of kitchen

revolution. We began by making a hundred pounds a week—and couldn't

always get rid of it. Now—why the day before I sailed we sent six

thousand cans to the Queen of Madagascar. I hope she'll read the

instructions!"
"It takes the breath. What splendid revenue must be from that!"
The Senator merely smiled, and played with his watch chain. "I should

hate to brag," he said, but anyone could see from the absence of a

diamond ring on his little finger that he was a person of weight in his

community.
"Oh!" said momma, "my daughter is awake at last! Mamie, let me introduce

Count Filgiatti. Count, my daughter. What a pity you went to sleep,

love. The Count has been giving us such a delightful afternoon."
The carriage swayed a good deal as the Count stood up to bow, but that

had no effect either upon the dignity or the gratification he expressed.

His pleasure was quite ingratiating, or would have been if he had been a

little taller. As it was, it was amusing, and I recognised an

opportunity for the study of Italian character. I don't mean that I made

up my mind to avail myself of it, but I saw that the opportunity was

there.
"So you've been reading the New York World," I said kindly.
"I have read, yes, two avertissimi. Not more, I fear. But they are

also amusing, the avertissimi." His voice was certainly agreeably

deferential, with a note of gratitude.
"Now, if you wouldn't mind taking the corner opposite my daughter,

Count Filgiatti," put in poppa, "you and she could talk more

comfortably, and Mrs. Wick could put her feet up and get a little nap."
"I am too happy if I shall not be a trouble to Mees," the Count

responded, beaming. And I said, "Dear me, no; how could he?" at which he

very obligingly changed his seat.
I hardly know how we drifted into abstract topics. The Count's English

was so bad that my sense of humour should have confined him to the

weather and the scenery; but it is nevertheless true that about an hour

later, while the landscape turned itself into a soft, warm chromo in the

fading sunset, and both my parents soundly slept, we were discussing the

barrier of religion to marriage between Protestants and Roman Catholics.

I did not hesitate to express the most liberal sentiments.
"Since there are to be no marriages in heaven," I said, "what difference

can it make, in married life, how people get there?"
"The signor and signora think also so?"
"Oh, I daresay poppa and momma have got their own opinions," I said,

"but that is mine."
"You do not think as they!" he exclaimed.
"I don't know what they think," I explained. "I haven't asked them. But

I've got my own thinker, you know." I searched for simple expressions,

and I seemed to make him understand.
"So! Then this prejudice is dead for you, Senorita—mees?"
"I like 'Senorita' best," I said. "I believe it is." At that moment I

divined that he was a Roman Catholic. How, I don't know. So I added,

"But I've never had the slightest reason to give it a thought."
"That must be," he said softly, "because you never met, Senorita—may I

say this?—one single gentleman w'at is Catholic."
"That's rather clever of you," I said. "Perhaps that is why."
The Italian character struck me as having interesting phases, but I did

not allow this impression to appear. I looked indifferently out of the

window. Italian sunsets are very becoming.
"The signora, your mother, has told me that you have no brothers or

sisters, Mees Wick. She made me the confidence—it was most kind."
"There never has been any secret about it, Count."
"Then you have not even one?" Count Filgiatti's eyes were full of

melancholy sympathy.
"I think," I said with coldness, "that in a matter of that kind, momma's

word should hardly need corroboration."
"Ah, it is sad! With me what difference! Can you believe of eleven? And

the father with the saints! And I of course am the eldest of all."
"Dear me," I said, "what a responsibility!"
"Ah, you recognise! you understand the—the necessities, yes?"
At that moment the train stopped at Civita Vecchia, and the Senator

awoke and put his hat on. "The Eternal City," he remarked when he

descried that the name of the station was not Rome, "appears to have an

eternal railway to match. There seems to be a feeding counter here

though—we might have another try at those slices of veal boiled in

tomatoes and smothered with macaroni that they give the pilgrim stranger

in these parts. You may lead the world in romance, Count, but you don't

put any of it in your railway refreshments."
As we passed out into the smooth-toned talkative darkness, Count

Filgiatti said in my ear, "Mistra and Madame Wick have kindly consented

to receive my visit at the hotel to-morrow. Is it agreeable to you also

that I come?"
And I said, "Why, certainly!"

CHAPTER XI.
We descended next morning to realise how original we were in being in

the plains of Italy in July. The Fulda people and the Miss Binghams and

Mrs. Portheris had prevented our noticing it before, but in the Hotel

Mascigni, Via del Tritone, we seemed to have arrived at a point of arid

solitude, which gave poppa a new and convincing sense of all he was

going through in pursuit of Continental culture. We sat in one corner of

the "Sala di mangiari" at a small square table, and in all the length

and breadth and sumptuousness of that magnificent apartment—Italian

hotel dining-rooms are always florid and palatial—there was only one

other little square table with a cloth on it and an appearance of

expectancy. The rest were heaped with chairs, bottom side up, with their

legs in the air; the chandeliers were tied up in brown holland, and

through a depressed and exhausted atmosphere, suggestive of magnificent

occasions temporarily in eclipse, moved, with a casual languid air, a

very tall waiter and a very short one. At mysterious exits to the rear

occasionally appeared the form of the chef exchanging plates. It was

borne in upon one that in the season the chef would be remanded to the

most inviolable seclusion.
"Do you suppose Pompeii will be any worse than this?" inquired the

Senator.
"Talk about Americans pervading the Continent," he continued, casting

his eye over the surrounding desolation. "Where are they? I should be

glad to see them. Great Scott! if it comes to that, I should be glad to

see a blooming Englishman!"
It wasn't an answer to prayer, for there had been no opportunity for

devotion, but at that moment the door opened and admitted Mr., Mrs., and

Miss Emmeline Malt, and Miss Callis. The reunion was as rapt as the

Senator and Emmeline could make it, and cordial in every other respect.

Mr. Malt explained that they had come straight through from Paris, as

time was beginning to press.
"We couldn't leave out Rome," he said, "on account of Mis' Malt's

mother—she made such a point of our seeing the prison of Saint Paul. In

her last letter she was looking forward very anxiously to our safe

return to get an account of it. She's a leader in our experience

meetings, and I couldn't somehow make up my mind to face her without

it."
"Poppa," remarked Emmeline, "is not so foolish as he looks."
"We were just wondering," exclaimed momma, "who that table was laid for.

But we never thought of you. Isn't it strange?"
We agreed that it was little short of marvellous.
The tall waiter strolled up for the commands of the Malt party. His

demeanour showed that he resented the Malts, who were, nevertheless,

innocent respectable people. As Emmeline ordered "café au lait pour

tous" he scowled and made curious contortions with his lower jaw.

"Anything else you want?" he inquired, with obvious annoyance.
"Yes," said Miss Callis. He further expressed his contempt by twisting

his moustache, and waited in silent disdain.
"I want," said Miss Callis sweetly, leaning forward with her chin

artlessly poised in her hand, "to know if you are paid to make faces at

the guests of this hotel."
There was laughter, above which Emmeline's crow rose loud and clear, and

as the waiter hastened away, suddenly transformed into a sycophant,

poppa remarked, "I see you've got those hotel tickets, too. Let me give

you a little pointer. Say nothing about it until next day. They are like

that sometimes. In being deprived of the opportunity of swindling us,

they feel that they've been done themselves."
"Oh," said Mr. Malt, "we never reveal it for twenty-four hours. That

fellow must have smelled 'em on us. Now, how were you proposing to spend

the day?"
"We're going to the Forum," remarked Emmeline. "Do come with us, Mr.

Wick. We should love to have you."
"We mustn't forget the Count," said momma to the Senator.
"Are you paid to make faces?"
"Are you paid to make faces?"
"What Count?" Emmeline inquired. "Did you ever, momma! Mis' Wick knows

a count. She's been smarter than we have, hasn't she? Introduce him to

us, Mis' Wick."
"Emmeline," said her mother severely, "you are as personal as ever you

can be. I don't know whatever Mis' Wick will think of you."
"She's merely full of intelligent curiosity, Mis' Malt," said Mr. Malt,

who seemed to be in the last stage of infatuated parent. "I know you'll

excuse her," he added to momma, who said with rather frigid emphasis,

"Oh yes, we'll excuse her." But the hint was lost and Emmeline remained.

Poppa looked in his memorandum book and found that the Count was not to

arrive until 3 P.M. There was, therefore, no reason why we should not

accompany the Malts to the Forum, and it was arranged.
A quarter of an hour later we were rolling through Rome. As a family we

were rather subdued by the idea that it was Rome, there was such immense

significance even in the streets with tramways, though it was rather an

atmosphere than anything of definite detail; but no such impression

weighed upon the Malts. They took Rome at its face value and refused to

recognise the unearned increment heaped up by the centuries. However, as

we were divided in two carriages, none of us had all the Malts.
It was warm and dusty, the air had a malarious taste. We drove first, I

remember, to the American druggist's in the Piazza di Spagna for some

magnesia Mrs. Malt wanted for Emmeline, who had prickly heat. It was

annoying to have one's first Roman impressions confused with Emmeline

and magnesia and prickly heat; but Mrs. Malt appeared to think that Rome

attracted visitors chiefly by means of that American druggist. She said

she was perfectly certain we should find an American dentist there, too,

if we only took the time to look him up. I can't say whether she took

the time. We didn't.
It was interesting, the Piazza di Spagna, because that is where

everybody who has read "Roba di Roma" knows that the English and

Americans have lived ever since the days when dear old Mr. Story and the

rest used to coach it from Civita Vecchia—in hotels, and pensions, and

apartments, the people in Marion Crawford's novels. We could only decide

that the plain, severe, many-storied houses with the shops underneath

had charms inside to compensate for their outward lack. Not a tree

anywhere, not a scrap of grass, only the lava pavement, and the view of

the druggist's shop and the tourists' agency office. Miss Callis said

she didn't see why man should be for ever bound up with the vegetable

creation—it was like living in a perpetual salad—and was disposed to

defend the Piazza di Spagna at all points, it looked so nice and

expensive. But Miss Callis's tastes were very distinctly urban.
That druggist's establishment was on the Pincian Hill! It seemed, on

reflection, an outrage. We all looked about us, when we discovered

this, for the other six, and another of the foolish geographical

illusions of the school-room was shattered for each of us. The Rome of

my imagination was as distinctly seven-hilled as a quadruped is

four-legged, the Rome I saw had no eminences to speak of anywhere.

Perhaps, as poppa suggested, business had moved away from the hills and

we should find them in the suburbs, but this we were obliged to leave

unascertained.
Through the warm empty streets we drove and looked at Rome. It was

driving through time, through history, through art, and going backward.

And through the Christian religion, for we started where the pillar of

Pius IX., setting forth the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception,

reaffirmed a modern dogma of the great church across the Tiber; and we

rattled on past other and earlier memorials of that church thick-built

into the Middle Ages, and of the Early Fathers, and of the very

Apostles. All heaped and crowded and over-built, solid and ragged,

decaying and defying decay, clinging to her traditions with both hands,

old Rome jostled before us. Presently uprose a great and crumbling arch

and a difference, and as we passed it the sound of the life of the city

died indistinctly away and a silence grew up, with the smell of the sun

upon grasses and weeds, and we stopped and looked down into Cæsar's

world, which lay below us, empty. We gazed in silence for a moment, and

then Emmeline remarked that she could make as good a Forum with a box of

blocks.
"I shouldn't wonder but what you express the sentiments of all

present," said her father admiringly. "Now is it allowable for us to go

down there and make ourselves at home amongst those antique pillars, or

have we got to take the show in from here?"
"No, Malt," said the Senator, helping the ladies out, "I can't say I

agree with you. It's a dead city, that's what it is, and for my part

I've never seen anything so impressive."
"Mr. Wick," remarked Miss Callis, "has not visited Philadelphia."
"Well, for a municipal cemetery," returned Mr. Malt, "it's pretty

uncared for. If there was any enterprise in this capital it would be

suitably railed in with posts and chains, and a monument inscribed 'Here

lies Rome's former greatness' or something like that. But the Italians

haven't got a particle of go—I've noticed that all through."
We went down the wooden stair, a century at a step, and presently walked

and talked, we seven Americans, in that elder Rome that most people know

so much better than the one with St. Peter's and the Corso, because of

the clinging nature of those early impressions which we construe for

ourselves with painful reference to lists of exceptions. We all felt

that it was a small place to have had so much to say to history, and

were obliged to remind ourselves that we weren't looking at the whole of

it. Poppa acknowledged that his tendency to compare it unfavourably, in

spite of the verdict of history, with Chicago was checked by a smell

from the Cloaca Maxima, which proved that the Ancient Romans probably

enjoyed enteric and sewer gas quite as much as we do, although under

names that are to be found only in dictionaries now. Mrs. Malt said the

place surprised her in being so yellow—she had always imagined pictures

of it to have been taken in the sunset, but now she saw that it was

perfectly natural. Acting upon Mr. Malt's advice, we did not attempt to

identify more than the leading features, and I remember distinctly, in

consequence, that the temple of Castor had three columns standing and

the temple of Saturn had eight, while of the Basilica Julia there was

nothing at all but the places where they used to be. Mrs. Malt said it

made her feel quite idolatrous to look at them, and for her part she

couldn't be sorry they had fallen so much into decay—it was only right

and proper. This launched Mr. and Mrs. Malt and my parents upon a

discussion which threatened to become unwisely polemic if Emmeline had

not briefly decided it in favour of Christianity.
Momma and Mrs. Malt expressed a desire above all things to see the

temple and apartments of the Vestal Virgins, which Miss Callis with some

surprise begged them on no account to mention in the presence of the

gentlemen.
"There are some things," remarked Miss Callis austerely, "from which no

respectable married lady would wish to lift the veil of the classics."
Momma was inclined to argue the point, but Miss Callis looked so

shocked that she desisted.
"Perhaps, Mrs. Wick," she said sarcastically, "you intend to go to see

the Baths of Caracallus!"
To which momma replied certainly not, that was a very different thing.

And if I am unable to describe the Baths of Caracallus in this history,

it is on account of Miss Callis's personal influence and the remarkable

development of her sense of propriety.
At momma's suggestion we walked slowly all round the Via Sacra, looking

steadily down at its little triangular original paving-stones, and tried

to imagine ourselves the shackled captives of Scipio. If the party had

not consisted so largely of Emmeline the effort might have been

successful. Fragments of exhumed statuary, discoloured and featureless,

stood tipped in rows along the shorn foundations and inspired in Mr.

Malt a serious curiosity.
"The ancients," said Mr. Malt with conviction, "were every bit as smart

as the moderns, meaning born intelligence. Look at that ear—that ear

took talent. There isn't a terra-cotta factory in the United States that

could turn out a better ear to-day. But they hadn't what we call

gumption, they put all their capital into one line of business, and you

may be sure they swamped the market. If they'd just done a little

inventing now, instead—worried out the idea of steam, or gas, or

electricity—why Rome might never have fallen to this day." And no one

interfered with Mr. Malt's idea that the fall of Rome was a purely

commercial disaster. Doubtless it was out of regard for his feelings,

but he was exactly the sort of man to compel you to prove your

assertion.
We found the boundaries of the first Forum of the Republic, and poppa,

pacing it in a soft felt hat and a silk duster, offered a Senatorial

contrast to history. He looked round him with dignity and made the

gesture which goes with his most sustained oratorical flights. "I

wouldn't have backed up Cato in everything," he said thoughtfully. "No.

There were occasions on which I should have voted against the old man,

and the little American school-boys of to-day would have had to decline

'Mugwumpus' in consequence." And at the thought of Cannæ and Trasimene

the nineteenth century Senator from Illinois fiercely pulled his beard.
We turned our pilgrim feet to where the Colosseum wheels against the sky

and gives up the world's eternal supreme note of splendour and of

cruelty; and along the solitary dusty Appian Way, as if it were a

country lane of the time we know, came a ragged Roman urchin with a

basket. Under the triumphal arch of Titus, where his forefathers jeered

at the Jews in manacled procession, we bargained with him for his purple

plums. He had the eyes and the smile of immemorial Italy for his own,

and the bones of Imperial Rome in equal inheritance, which he also

wished to sell, by the way, in jagged fragments from his trouser

pockets. And it linked up those early days with that particular

afternoon in a curiously simple way to think that from the Cæsars to

King Humbert there has never been a year without just such

brown-cheeked, dark-eyed, imperfectly washed little Roman boys upon the

Appian Way.

CHAPTER XII.
We were too late for the hotel déjeuner, and had to order it, I

remember, à la carte. That was why the Count was kept waiting. We were

kept waiting, too, which seemed at the moment of more importance, since

the atmosphere of the classics had given us excellent appetites.

Emmeline decided upon ices and petits fours in the Corso for her

party, after which they were going to let nothing interfere with their

inspection of the prison of St. Paul; but we came back and ordered a

haricot. In the cavernous recesses beyond the door which opened

kitchen-ward, commands resounded, and a quarter of an hour later a boy

walked casually through the dining-room bearing beans in a basket. Time

went on, and the Senator was compelled to send word that he had not

ordered the repast for the following day. The small waiter then made a

pretence of activity, and brought vinegar and salt, and rolls and water.

"The peutates is notta-cooks," said he in deprecation, and we were

distressed to postpone the Count for those peutates. But what else was

possible?
The dismaying part was that after luncheon had enabled us to regard a

little thing like that with equanimity, my parents abandoned it to me.

Momma said she knew she was missing a great deal, but she really didn't

feel equal to entertaining the Count; her back had given out completely.

The Senator wished to attend to his mail. With the assistance of his

letters and telegrams he was beginning to bear up wonderfully, and, as

it was just in, I hadn't the heart to interfere. "You can apologise for

us, daughter," said poppa, "and say something polite about our seeing

him later. Don't let him suppose we've gone back on him in any way. It's

a thing no young fellow in America would think of, but with these

foreigners you never can tell."
I saw at once that the Count was annoyed. He was standing in the middle

of the salon, fingering his sword-hilt in a manner which expressed the

most absurd irritation. So I said immediately that I was awfully sorry,

but it seemed so difficult to get anything to eat in Rome at that time

of year, that the head-waiter was really responsible, and wouldn't he

sit down?
"I don't know what you will think of us," I went on as we shook hands.

"How long have you been kind enough to wait, anyway?"
"Since a quarter of an hour—only," replied the Count, with a difficult

smile, "but now that I see you it is forgotten all."
"That's very nice of you," I said. "I assure you momma was quite worked

up about keeping you waiting. It's rather trying to the American

temperament to be obliged to order a hurried luncheon from the

market-gardener."
"So! In America you have him not—the market garden? You are each his

own vegetable. Yes? Ah, how much better than the poor Italian! But

Mistra and Madame Wick, they have not, I hope, the indisposition?"
"Well, I'm afraid they have, Count—something like that. They said I was

to ask you to excuse them. You see they've been sight-seeing the whole

morning, and that's something that can't be done by halves in your city.

The stranger has to put his whole soul into it, hasn't he?"
"Ah, the whole soul! It is too fatiguing," Count Filgiatti assented. He

glanced at me uncertainly, and rose. "Kindly may I ask that you give my

deepest afflictions to Mistra and Madame Wick for their health?"
"Oh," I said, "if you must! But I'm here, you know." I put no hauteur

into my tone, because I saw that it was a misunderstanding.
He still hesitated and I remembered that the Filgiatti intelligence

probably dated from the Middle Ages, and had undergone very little

alteration since. "You have made such a short visit," I said. "I must be

a very bad substitute for momma and poppa."
A flash of comprehension illuminated my visitor's countenance. "I pray

that you do not think such a wrong thing," he said impulsively. "If it

is permitted, I again sit down."
"Do," said I, and he did. Anything else would have seemed perfectly

unreasonable, and yet for the moment he twisted his moustache,

apparently in the most foolish embarrassment. To put him at his ease, I

told him how lovely I thought the fountains. "That's one of your most

ideal connections with ancient history, don't you think?" I said. "The

fact that those old aqueducts of yours have been bringing down the water

to sparkle and ripple in Roman streets ever since."
"Idealissimo! And the Trevi of Bernini—I hope you threw the soldi, so

that you must come back to Rome!"
"We weren't quite sure which it was," I responded, "so poppa threw soldi

into all of them, to make certain. Sometimes he had to make two or three

shots," and I could not help smiling at the recollection.
"Ah, the profusion!"
"I don't suppose they came to a quarter of a dollar, Count. It is the

cheapest of your amusements."
The Count reflected for a moment.
"Then you wish to return to Rome," he said softly; "you take interest

here?"
"Why yes," I said, "I'm not a barbarian. I'm from Illinois."
"Then why do you go away?"
"Our time is so limited."
"Ah, Mees Wick, you have all of your life." The Italians certainly have

exquisite voices.
"That is true," I said thoughtfully.
"Many young American ladies now live always in Italy," pursued Count

Filgiatti.
"Is that so?" I replied pleasantly. "They are domiciled here with their

parents?"
"Y—yes. Sometimes it is like that. And sometimes——"
"Sometimes they are working in the studios. I know. A delightful life it

must be."
The Count looked at the carpet. "Ah, signorina, you misunderstand my

poor English," he said; "she means quite different."
It was not coquetry which induced me to cast down my eyes.
"The American young lady will sometimes contract alliance."
"Oh!" I exclaimed.
"Yes. And if it is a good arrangimento it is always quite quite

happy."
"We are said," I observed thoughtfully, "to be able, as a people, to

accommodate ourselves to circumstances."
"You approve this idea! Signorina, you are so amiable, it is heavenly."
"I see no objection to it," I said. "It is entirely a matter of taste."
"And the American ladies have much taste," observed Count Filgiatti

blandly.
"I'm afraid it isn't infallible," I said, "but it is charming to hear it

approved."
"The American lady comes in Italy. She is young, beautiful, with a

grace—ah! And perhaps there is a little income—a few dollar—but we do

not speak of that—it is a trifle, only to make possible the

arrangimento."
"I see," I said.
"The American lady is so perceiving—it is also a charm. The Italian

gentleman has a dignity of his. He is perhaps from a family a little

old. It is nothing—the matter is of the heart—but it makes possible

the arrangimento."
"I have read of such things before," I said, "in the newspapers. It is

most amusing to hear them corroborated on the spot. But that is one of

the charms of travel, Count Filgiatti."
The Count hesitated and a shade of indecision crossed his swarthy little

features. Then he added simply, "For me she has always been a vision,

that American lady. It is for this that I study the English. I have

thought, 'When I meet one of those so charming Americans, I will do my

possible.'"
I could not help thinking of that family of eleven and the father with

the saints. It was pathetic to feel one's self a realised vision without

any capacity for beneficence—worse in some respects than being obliged

to be unkind to hopes with no financial basis. It made one feel somehow

so mercenary. But before I could think of anything to say—it was such a

difficult juncture—the Count went on.
"But in the Italian idea it is better first one thing to know—the

agreement of the American signorina. If she will not, the Italian

nobleman is too much disgrace. It is not good to offer the name and the

title if the lady say no, I do not want—take that poor thing away."
How artless it was! Yet my sympathy ebbed immediately. Not my curiosity,

however. Perhaps at this or an earlier point I should have gone blushing

away and forever pondered in secret the problem of Count Filgiatti's

intentions. I confess that it didn't even occur to me—it was such a

little Count and so far beyond the range of my emotions. Instead, I

smiled in a non-committal way and said that Count Filgiatti's prudence

was most unique.
"With a friend to previously discover then it is easy. But perhaps the

lady will have no friends in Italy."
"You would have to be prepared for that," I said. "Certainly."
"Also she perhaps quickly go away. The Americans are so instantaneous.

Maybe my vision fade like—like anything."
"In a perspective of tourists' coupons," I suggested.
For a moment there was silence, through which we could hear the

scrubbing-brush of the chambermaid on the marble hall of the first

floor. It seemed a final note of desolation.
"If I must speak of myself believe me it is not a nobody the Count

Filgiatti," he went on at last. "Two Cardinals I have had in my family

and one is second cousin to the Pope."
"Fancy the Pope's having relations!" I said, "but I suppose there is

nothing to prevent it."
"Nothing at all. In my family I have had many ambassadors, but that was

a little formerly. Once a Filgiatti married with a Medici—but these

things are better for Mistra and Madame Wick to inquire."
"Poppa is very much interested in antiquities, but I'm afraid there will

hardly be time, Count Filgiatti."
"Listen, I will say all! Always they have been much too large, the

families Filgiatti. So now perhaps we are a little reduce. But there

is still somethings-ah—signorina, can you pardon that I speak these

things, but the time is so small—there is fifteen hundred lire yearly

revenue to my pocket."
"About three hundred dollars," I observed sympathetically. Count

Filgiatti nodded with the smile of a conscious capitalist. "Then of

course," I said, "you won't marry for money." I'm afraid this was a

little unkind, but I was quite sure the Count would perceive no irony,

and said it for my own amusement.
"Jamais! In Italy you will find that never! The Italian gives always

the heart before—before——"
"The arrangimento," I suggested softly.
"Indeed, yes. There is also the seat of the family."
"The seat of the family," I repeated. "Oh—the family seat. Of course,

being a Count, you have a castle. They always go together. I had

forgotten."
"A castle I cannot say, but for the country it is very well. It is not

amusing there, in Tuscany. It is a little out of repairs. Twice a year I

go to see my mother and all those brothers and sisters—it is enough!

And the Countess, my mother, has said to me two hundred times, 'Marry

with an Americaine, Nicco—it is my command.' 'Nicco,' she calls me—it

is what you call jack-name."
The Count smiled deprecatingly, and looked at me with a great deal of

sentiment, twisting his moustache. Another pause ensued. It's all very

well to say I should have dismissed him long before this, but I should

like to know on what grounds?
"I wish very much to write my mother that I have found the American lady

for a new Countess Filgiatti," he said at last with emotion.
"Well," I said awkwardly, "I hope you will find her."
"Ah, Mees Wick," exclaimed the Count recklessly, "you are that American

lady. When I saw you in the railway I said, 'It is my vision!' At once I

desired to embrace the papa. And he was not cold with me—he told me of

the soda. I had courage, I had hope. At first when I see you to-day I

am a little derange. In the Italian way I speak first with the papa.

Then came a little thought in my heart—no, it is propitious! In America

the daughter maka always her own arrangimento. So I am spoken."
At this I rose immediately. I would not have it on my conscience that I

toyed with the matrimonial proposition of even an Italian Count.
"I think I understand you, Count Filgiatti," I said—There is something

about the most insignificant proposal that makes one blush in a

perfectly absurd way. I have never been able to get over it—"and I fear

I must bring this interview to a close. I——"
"Ah, it is too embarrassing for you! It is experience very new, very

strange."
"No," I said, regaining my composure, "not at all. But the fact is,

Count Filgiatti, the transaction you propose doesn't appeal to me. It is

too business-like to be sentimental, and too sentimental to be

business-like. I'm sorry to seem disobliging, but I really couldn't make

up my mind to marry a gentleman for his ancestors who are dead, even if

he was willing to marry me for my income which may disappear. Poppa is

very speculative. But I know there's a certain percentage of Americans

who think a count with a family seat is about the only thing worth

bringing away from Europe, now that we manufacture so much for

ourselves, and if I meet any of them I'll bear you in mind."
"Upon my word!"
It was Mrs. Portheris, in the doorway behind us, just arrived from

Siena.

I mentioned the matter to my parents, thinking it might amuse them, and

it did. From a business point of view, however, poppa could not help

feeling a certain amount of sympathy for the Count. "I hope, daughter,"

he said, "you didn't give him the ha-ha to his face."

CHAPTER XIII.
There is the very tenderness of desolation upon the Appian Way. To me it

suggested nothing of the splendour of Roman villas and the tragedy of

flying Emperors. It spoke only of itself, lying over the wide silence of

the noon-day fields, historic doubtless, but noon-day certainly.

Something lives upon the warm stretches of the Appian Way, something

that talks of the eternal and unchangeable, and yet has the pathos of

the fragmentary and the lost. Perhaps it is the ghost of a genius that

has failed of reincarnation, and inspires the weeds and the leaf-shadows

instead. Thinking of it, one remembers only an almond tree in flower,

that grew beside a ruined arch by the wayside—both quite alone in the

sunlight—and perhaps of a meek, young, marble Cecilia, unquestioningly

prostrate, submissive to the axe.
We were on our way to the Catacombs, momma, the Senator, and Mrs.

Portheris in one carriage, R. Dod, Mr. Mafferton, Isabel, and I in the

other. I approved of the arrangement, because the mutually distant

understanding that existed between Mr. Mafferton and me had already been

the subject of remark by my parents. ("For old London acquaintances you

and Mr. Mafferton seem to have very little to say to each other," momma

had observed that very morning.) It was borne in upon me that this was

absurd. People have no business to be estranged for life because one of

them has happened to propose to the other, unless, of course, he has

been accepted and afterwards divorced, which is quite a different thing.

Besides, there was Dicky to think of. I decided that there was a medium

in all things, and to help me to find it I wore a blouse from Madame

Valerie in the Rue de l'Opera, which cost seven times its value, and was

naturally becoming. Perhaps this was going to extreme measures; but he

was a recalcitrant Englishman, and for Dicky's sake one had to think of

everything.
Englishmen have a genius for looking uncomfortable. Their feelings are

terribly mixed up with their personal appearance. It was some time

before Mr. Mafferton would consent to be even tolerably at his ease,

though I made a distinct effort to show that I bore no malice. It must

have been the mere memory of the past that embarrassed him, for the

other two were as completely unaware of his existence as they well could

be in the same carriage. For a time, as I talked in commonplaces, Mr.

Mafferton in monosyllables, and Mr. Dod and Miss Portheris in regards,

the most sordid realist would have hesitated to chronicle our

conversation.
"When," I inquired casually, "are you thinking of going back, Mr.

Mafferton?"
"To town? Not before October, I fancy!"
"Even in Rome," I observed, "London is 'town' to you, isn't it? What a

curious thing insular tradition is!"
"I suppose Rome was invented first," he replied haughtily.
"Why yes," I said; "while the ancestors of Eaton-square were running

about in blue paint and bear-skins, and Albert Gate, in the directory,

was a mere cave. What do you suppose," I went on, following up this line

of thought, "when you were untutored savages, was your substitute for

the Red Book?"
"Really," said this Englishman, "I haven't an idea. Perhaps as you have

suggested they had no addresses."
For a moment I felt quite depressed. "Did you think it was a conundrum?"

I asked. "You so often remind me of Punch, Mr. Mafferton."
I shouldn't have liked anyone to say that to me, but it seemed to have

quite a mollifying effect upon Mr. Mafferton. He smiled and pulled his

moustache in the way Englishmen always do, when endeavouring to absorb a

compliment.
"Dear old London," I went on reminiscently, "what a funny experience it

was!"
"To the Transatlantic mind," responded Mr. Mafferton stiffly, "one can

imagine it instructive."
"It was a revelation to mine," I said earnestly—"a revelation." Then,

remembering Mr. Mafferton's somewhat painful connection with the

revelation, I added carefully, "From a historic point of view. The

Tower, you know, and all that."
"Ah!" said Mr. Mafferton, with a distant eye upon the Campagna.
It was really very difficult.
"Do you remember the day we went to Madame Tussaud's?" I asked. Perhaps

my intonation was a little dreamy. "I shall never forget William the

Conqueror—never."
"Yes—yes, I think I do." It was clearly an effort of memory.
"And now," I said regretfully, "it can never be the same again."
"Certainly not." He used quite unnecessary emphasis.
"William and the others having been since destroyed by fire," I

continued. Mr. Mafferton looked foolish. "What a terrible scene that

must have been! Didn't you feel when all that royal wax melted as if the

dynasties of England had been wrecked over again! What effect did it

have on dear old Victoria?"
"One question at a time," said Mr. Mafferton, and I think he smiled.
"Now you remind me of Sandford and Merton," I said, "and a place for

everything and everything in its place. And punctuality is the thief of

time. And many others."
"You haven't got it quite right," said Mr. Mafferton with incipient

animation. "May I correct you? 'Procrastination,' not 'punctuality.'"
"Thanks," I said. I could not help observing that for quite five minutes

Mr. Mafferton had made no effort to overhear the conversation between

Mr. Dod and Miss Portheris. It was a trifle, but life is made up of

little things.
"I don't believe we adorn our conversation with proverbs in America as

much as we did," I continued. "I guess it takes too long. If you make

use of a proverb you see, you've got to allow for reflection first, and

reflection afterwards, and a sigh, and very few of us have time for

that. It is one of our disadvantages."
Mr. Mafferton heard me with attention.
"Really!" he said in quite his old manner when we used to discuss

Presidential elections and peanuts and other features of life in my

republic. "That is a fact of some interest—but I see you cling to one

little Americanism, Miss Wick. Do you remember"—he actually looked

arch—"once assuring me that you intended to abandon the verb to

'guess'?"
"I don't know why we should leave all the good words to Shakespeare," I

said, "but I was under a great many hallucinations about the American

language in England, and I daresay I did."
If I responded coldly, it was at the thought of my last interview with

poor dear Arthur, and his misprised larynx. But at this moment a wildly

encouraging sign from Dicky reminded me that his interests and not my

own emotions were to be considered.
"We mustn't reproach each other, must we," I said softly. "I don't

bear a particle of malice—really and truly."
Mr. Mafferton cast a glance of alarm at Mr. Dod and Miss Portheris, who

were raptly exchanging views as to the respective merits of a cleek and

a brassey shot given certain peculiar bunkers and a sandy green—as if

two infatuated people talking golf would have ears for anything else!
"Not on any account," he said hurriedly.
"The best quality of friendship sometimes arises out of the most

unfortunate circumstances," I added. The sympathy in my voice was for

Dicky and Isabel.
Mr. Mafferton looked at me expressively and the carriage drew up at the

Catacombs of St. Callistus. Mrs. Portheris was awaiting us by the gate,

however, so in getting out I gave my hand to Dicky.
Inside and outside the gate, how quiet it was. Nothing on the Appian Way

but dust and sunlight, nothing in the field within the walls but

yellowing grass and here and there a field-daisy bending in the silence.

It made one think of an old faded water-colour, washed in with tears,

that clings to its significance though all its reality is gone. Then we

saw a little bare house to the left with an open door, and inside found

Brothers Demetrius and Eusebius in Trappist gowns and ropes, who would

sell us beads for the profitable employment of our souls, and chocolate

and photographs, and wonderful eucalyptus liqueur from the Three

Fountains, and when we had well bought would show us the city of the

long, long dead of which they were custodians. They were both obliging

enough to speak English, Brother Demetrius imperfectly and haltingly,

and without the assistance of those four front teeth which are so

especially necessary to a foreign tongue, Brother Eusebius fluently, and

with such richness of dialect that we were not at all surprised to learn

that he had served his Pope for some years in the State of New York.
"For de ladi de chocolate. Ith it not?" said Brother Demetrius, with an

inducive smile. "It ith de betht in de worl', dis chocolate."
"Don't you believe him," said Brother Eusebius, "he's known as the

oldest of the Roman frauds. Wants your money, that's what he wants."

Brother Demetrius shook his fist in amicable, wagging protest. "That's

the way he goes on, you know—quarrelsome old party. But I don't say

it's bad chocolate. Try it, young lady, try it."
He handed a bit to Isabel, who looked at her momma.
"There is no possible objection, my dear," said Mrs. Portheris, and she

nibbled it.
Dicky invested wildly.
"Dese photograff dey are very pritty," remarked Brother Demetrius to

momma, who was turning over some St. Stephens and St. Cecilias.
"He'd say anything to sell them," put in Brother Eusebius. "He never

thinks of his immortal soul, any more than if he was a poor miserable

heretic. He'll tell you they're originals next, taken by Nero at the

time. You're all good Catholics, of course?"
"We are not any kind of Catholics," said Mrs. Portheris severely.
"I'll give you my blessing all the same, and no extra charge. But the

saints forbid that I should be selling beads made out of their precious

bones to Protestants."
"I'll take that string," said momma.
"I wouldn't do it on any account," continued Brother Eusebius, as he

wrapped them up in blue paper, but momma still attaches a certain amount

of veneration to those beads.
"And what can I do for you, sir?" continued Brother Eusebius to the

Senator, rubbing his hands. "What'll be the next thing?"
"The Early Christians," replied poppa laconically, "if it's all the same

to you."
"Just in half a shake. Don't hurry yourselves. They'll keep, you

know—they've kept a good long while already. Now you, madam," said

Brother Eusebius to Mrs. Portheris, "have never had the influenza, I

know. It only attacks people advanced in life."
"Indeed I have," replied that lady. "Twice."
"Is that so! Well, you never would have had it if you'd been protected

with this liqueur of ours. It's death and burial on influenza," and

Brother Eusebius shook the bottle.
"I consider," said Mrs. Portheris solemnly, "that eucalyptus in another

form saved my life. But I inhaled it."
"Tho," ventured Brother Demetrius, "tho did I. But the wine ith for

internal drinking."
"Listen to him! Eternal drinking, that's what he means. You never saw

such an old boy for the influenza—gets it every week or so. How many

bottles, madam? Just a nip, after dinner, and you don't know how poetic

it will make you feel into the bargain."
"One bottle," replied Mrs. Portheris, "the larger size, please. Anything

with eucalyptus in it must be salutary. And as we are going underground,

where it is bound to be damp, I think I'll have a little now."
"That's what I call English common-sense," exclaimed Brother Eusebius,

getting out a glass. "Will nobody keep the lady company? It's Popish,

but it's good."
Nobody would. Momma observed rather uncautiously that the smell of it

was enough, at which Mrs. Portheris remarked, with some asperity, that

she hoped Mrs. Wick would never be obliged to be indebted to the

"smell." "It is quite excellent," she said, "most cordial. I really

think, as a precaution, I'll take another glass."
"Isn't it pretty strong?" asked poppa.
We followed the monks.
 We followed the monks.
"The influenza is stronger," replied Mrs. Portheris oracularly, and

finished her second potation.
"And nothing," said Brother Eusebius sadly, "for the gentleman standing

outside the door, who doesn't approve of encouraging the Roman Catholic

Church in any respect whatever. Dear me! dear me! we do get some queer

customers." At which Mr. Mafferton frowned portentously. But nothing

seemed to have any effect on Brother Eusebius.
"There are such a lot of you, and you are sure to be so inquisitive,

that we'll both go with you," said he, and took candles from a shelf.

Not ordinary candles at all—coils of long, slender strips, with one end

turned up to burn. At the sight of them momma shuddered and said she

hadn't thought it would be dark, and took the Senator's arm as a

precautionary measure. Then we followed the monks Eusebius and

Demetrius, who wrapped shawls round their sloping shoulders and hurried

across the grass towards the little brick entrance to the Catacombs,

shading their candles from the wind that twisted their brown gowns round

their legs, with all the anxiety to get it over shown by janitors of

buildings of this world.

CHAPTER XIV.
At first through the square chambers of the early Popes and the narrow

passages lined with empty cells, nearest to the world outside, we kept

together, and it was mainly Eusebius who discoursed of the building of

the Catacombs, which he informed us had a pagan beginning.
"But our blessed early bishops said, 'Why should the devil have all the

accommodations?' and when once the Church got its foot in there wasn't

much room for him. But a few pagans there are here to this day in

better company than they ever kept above ground," remarked Brother

Eusebius.
"Can you tell them apart?" asked Mr. Dod, "the Christians and the

Pagans?"
"Yes," replied that holy man, "by the measurements of the jaw-bone. The

Christians, you see, were always lecturing the other fellows, so their

jaw-bones grew to an awful size. Some of 'em are simply parliamentary."
"Dat," said Brother Demetrius anxiously—as nobody had laughed—"ith a

joke."
"I noticed the intention," said poppa. "It's down in the guide-book

that you've been 'absolved from the vow of silence'—is that correct?"
"Right you are," said Brother Eusebius. "What about it?"
"Oh, nothing—only it explains a good deal. I guess you enjoy it, don't

you?"
But Brother Eusebius was bending over a cell in better preservation than

most of them, and was illuminating with his candle the bones of the

dweller in it. The light flickered on the skull of the Early Christian

and the tonsure of the modern one and made comparisons. It also cut the

darkness into solid blocks, and showed us broken bits of marble, faint

stains of old frescoes, strange rough letters, and where it wavered

furthest the uncertain lines of a graven cross.
"Here's one of the original inhabitants," remarked Eusebius. "He's been

here all the time. I hope the ladies don't mind looking at him in his

bones?"
"Thee, you can pick him up," said old Demetrius, handing a thigh-bone to

momma, who shrank from the privilege. "It ith quite dry."
"It seems such a liberty," she said, "and he looks so incomplete without

it. Do put it back."
"That's the way I feel," remarked Dicky, "but I don't believe he'd mind

our looking at a toe-bone. Are his toe-bones all there?"
"No," replied Demetrius, "I have count another day and he ith nine only.

Here ith a few."
"It is certainly a very solemn and unusual privilege," remarked Mr.

Mafferton, as the toe-bones went round, "to touch the mortal remnant of

an Early Christian."
"That altogether depends," said the Senator, "upon what sort of an Early

Christian he was. Maybe he was a saint of the first water, and maybe he

was a pillar of the church that ran a building society. Or, maybe, he

was only an average sort of Early Christian like you or me, in which

case he must be very uncomfortable at the idea of inspiring so much

respect. How are you going to tell?"
"The gentleman is right," said Brother Eusebius, and in considering

poppa's theory in its relation to the doubtful character before them

nobody noticed, except me, the petty larceny, by Richard Dod, of one

Early Christian toe-bone. His expression, I am glad to say, made me

think he had never stolen anything before; but you couldn't imagine a

more promising beginning for a career of embezzlement. As we moved on I

mentioned to him that the man who would steal the toe-bone of an Early

Christian, who had only nine, was capable of most crimes, at which he

assured me that he hadn't such a thing about him outside of his boots,

which shows how one wrong step leads to another.
We fell presently into two parties—Dicky, Mrs. Portheris, and I holding

to the skirts of Brother Demetrius. Brother Demetrius knew a great deal

about the Latin inscriptions and the history of Pope Damasus and the

chapel of the Bishops, and how they found the body of St. Cecilia,

after eight hundred years, fresh and perfect, and dressed in rich

vestments embroidered in gold; but his way of imparting it seriously

interfered with the value of his information, and we looked regretfully

after the other party.
"Here we have de tomb of Anterus and Fabianus——"
"I think we should keep up with the rest," interrupted Mrs. Portheris.
"Oh, I too, I know all dese Catacomb—I will take you everywheres—and

here, too, we have buried Entychianus."
"Where is Brother Eusebius taking the others?" asked Dicky.
"Now I tell you: he mith all de valuable ting, he is too fat and lazy;

only joke, joke, joke. And here we has buried Epis—martyr. Epis he wath

martyr."
The others, with their lights and voices, came into full view where four

passages met in a cubicle. "Oh," cried Isabel, catching sight of us,

"do come and see Jonah and the whale. It's too funny for anything."
"And where Damathuth found here the many good thainth he——"
"We would like to see Jonah," entreated Dicky.
"Well," said Brother Demetrius crossly, "you go thee him—you catch up.

I will no more. You do not like my Englis' very well. You go with fat

old joke-fellow, and I return the houth. Bethide, it ith the day of my

lumbago." And the venerable Demetrius, with distinct temper, turned his

back on us and waddled off.
We looked at each other in consternation.
"I'm afraid we've hurt his feelings," said Dicky.
"You must go after him, Mr. Dod, and apologize," commanded Mrs.

Portheris.
"Do you suppose he knows the way out?" I asked.
"It is a shame," said Dicky. "I'll go and tell him we'd rather have

him than Jonah any day."
Brother Demetrius was just turning a corner. Darkness encompassed him,

lying thick between us. He looked, in the light of his candle, like

something of Rembrandt's suspended for a moment before us. Dicky started

after him, and, presently, Mrs. Portheris and I were regarding each

other with more friendliness than I would have believed possible across

our flaring dips in the silence of the Catacombs.
"Poor old gentleman," I said; "I hope Mr. Dod will overtake him."
"So do I, indeed," said Mrs. Portheris. "I fear we have been very

inconsiderate. But young people are always so impatient," she added, and

put the blame where it belonged.
I did not retaliate with so much as a reproachful glance. Even as a

censor Mrs. Portheris was so eminently companionable at the moment. But

as we waited for Dicky's return neither of us spoke again. It made too

much noise. Minutes passed, I don't know how many, but enough for us to

look cautiously round to see if there was anything to sit on. There

wasn't, so Mrs. Portheris took my arm. We were not people to lean on

each other in the ordinary vicissitudes of life, and even under the

circumstances I was aware that Mrs. Portheris was a great deal to

support, but there was comfort in every pound of her. At last a faint

light foreshadowed itself in the direction of Dicky's disappearance, and

grew stronger, and was resolved into a candle and a young man, and Mr.

Dod, very much paler than when he left, was with us again. Mrs.

Portheris and I started apart as if scientifically impelled, and

exclaimed simultaneously, "Where is Brother Demetrius?"
"Nowhere in this graveyard," said Dicky. "He's well upstairs by this

time. Must have taken a short cut. I lost sight of him in about two

seconds."
"That was very careless of you, Mr. Dod," said Mrs. Portheris, "very

careless indeed. Now we have no option, I suppose, but to rejoin the

others; and where are they?"
They were certainly not where they had been. Not a trace nor an

echo—not a trace nor an echo—of anything, only parallelograms of

darkness in every direction, and our little circle of light flickering

on the tombs of Anterus, and Fabianus, and Entychianus, and

Epis—martyr—and we three within it, looking at each other.
"If you don't mind," said Dicky, "I would rather not go after them. I

think it's a waste of time. Personally I am quite contented to have

rejoined you. At one time I thought I shouldn't be able to, and the idea

was trying."
"We wouldn't dream of letting you go again," said Mrs. Portheris and I

simultaneously. "But," continued Mrs. Portheris, "we will all go in

search of the others. They can't be very far away. There is nothing so

alarming as standing still."
We proceeded along the passage in the direction of our last glimpse of

our friends and relatives, passing a number of most interesting

inscriptions, which we felt we had not time to pause and decipher, and

came presently to a divergence which none of us could remember. Half of

the passage went down three steps, and turned off to the left under an

arch, and the other half climbed two, and immediately lost itself in

blackness of darkness. In our hesitation Dicky suddenly stooped to a

trace of pink in the stone leading upward, and picked it up—three rose

petals.
"That settles it," he exclaimed. "Isa—Miss Portheris was wearing a

rose. I gave it to her myself."
"Did you, indeed," said Isabel's mamma coldly. "My dear child, how

anxious she will be!"
"Oh, I should think not," I said hopefully. "I am sure she can trust Mr.

Dod to take care of himself—and of us, too, for the matter of that."
"Mr. Dod!" exclaimed Mrs. Portheris with indignation. "My poor child's

anxiety will be for her mother."
And we let it go at that. But Dicky put the rose petals in his pocket

with the toe-bone, and hopefully remarked that there would be no

difficulty about finding her now. I mentioned that I had parents also,

at that moment, lost in the Catacombs, but he did not apologize.
The midnight of the place, as we walked on, seemed to deepen, and its

silence to grow more profound. The tombs passed us in solemn grey

ranges, one above the other—the long tombs of the grown-up people, and

the shorter ones of the children, and the very little ones of the

babies. The air held a concentrated dolor of funerals sixteen centuries

old, and the four dim stone walls seemed to have crept closer together.

"I think I will take your arm, Mr. Dod," said Mrs. Portheris, and "I

think I will take your other arm, Mr. Dod," said I.
"Thank you," replied Dicky, "I should be glad of both of yours," which

may look ambiguous now, but we quite understood it at the time. It made

rather uncomfortable walking in places, but against that overwhelming

majority of the dead it was comforting to feel ourselves a living unit.

We stumbled on, taking only the most obvious turnings, and presently the

passage widened into another little square chamber. "More bishops!"

groaned Dicky, holding up his candle.
"Perhaps," I replied triumphantly, "but Jonah, anyway," and I pointed

him out on the wall, in two shades of brown, a good deal faded, being

precipitated into the jaws of a green whale with paws and horns and a

smile, also a curled body and a three-forked tail. The wicked deed had

two accomplices only, who had apparently stopped rowing to do it.

Underneath was a companion sketch of the restitution of Jonah, in

perfect order, by the whale, which had, nevertheless, grown considerably

stouter in the interval, while an amiable stranger reclined in an arbor,

with his hand under his head, and looked on.
"As a child your intelligence promised well," said Dicky; "that is

Jonah, though not of the Revised Version. I don't think Bible stories

ought to be illustrated, do you, Mrs. Portheris? It has such a bad

effect on the imagination."
"We can talk of that at another time, Mr. Dod. At present I wish to be

restored to my daughter. Let us push on at once. And please explain how

it is that we have had to walk so far to get to this place, which was

only a few yards from where we were standing when Brother Demetrius left

us!" Mrs. Portheris's words were commanding, but her tone was the tone

of supplication.
"I'm afraid I can't," said Dicky, "but for that very reason I think we

had better stay where we are. They are pretty sure to look for us here."
"I cannot possibly wait to be looked for. I must be restored to my

daughter! You must make an effort, Mr. Dod. And, now that I think of it,

I have left the key of our boxes in the drawer of the dressing-table,

and the key of that is in it, and the housemaid has the key of the

room. It is absolutely necessary that I should go back to the hotel at

once."
"My dear lady," said Dicky, "don't you realize that we are lost?"
"Lost! Impossible! Shout, Mr. Dod!"
Dicky shouted, and all the Early Christians answered him. There are said

to be seven millions. Mrs. Portheris grasped his arm convulsively.
"Don't do that again," she said, "on any account. Let us go on!"
"Much better not," protested Dicky.
"On! on!" commanded Mrs. Portheris. There was no alternative. We put

Dicky in the middle again, and cautiously stepped out. A round of blue

paper under our chaperone's arm caught the eye of Mr. Dod. "What luck!"

he exclaimed, "you have brought the liqueur with you, Mrs. Portheris. I

think we'd better all have some, if you don't mind. I've been in warmer

cemeteries."
As she undid the bottle, Mrs. Portheris declared that she already felt

the preliminary ache of influenza. She exhorted us to copious draughts,

but it was much too nasty for more than a sip, though warming to a

degree.
"Better take very little at a time," Dicky suggested, but Mrs. Portheris

reaffirmed her faith in the virtues of eucalyptus, and with such majesty

as was compatible with the neck of the bottle, drank deeply. Then we

stumbled on. Presently Mrs. Portheris yawned widely twice, thrice, and

again. "I beg your pardon," said she, "I don't seem able to help it."
"It's the example of these gaping sepulchres," Dicky replied. "Don't

apologize."
The passages grew narrower and more complex, the tombs more irregular.

We came to one that partly blocked the path, tilted against the main

wall like a separate sarcophagus, though it was really part of the solid

rock. Looking back, a wall seemed to have risen behind us; it was a

distinctly perplexing moment, hard upon the nerves. The tomb was empty,

except for a few bones that might have been anything huddled at the

bottom, and Mrs. Portheris sat down on the lower end of it. "I really do

not feel able to go any further," she said; "the ascent is so

perpendicular."
I was going to protest that the place was as level as a street, but

Dicky forestalled me. "Eucalyptus," he said soothingly, "often has that

effect."
"We are lost," continued Mrs. Portheris lugubriously, "in the Catacombs.

We may as well make up our minds to it. We came here this morning at ten

o'clock, and I should think, I should think—thish mus' be minnight on

the following day."
"My watch has run down," said Dicky, "but you are probably quite right,

Mrs. Portheris."
"It is doubtful," Mrs. Portheris went on, pulling herself together,

"whether we are ever found. There are nine hundred miles of Catacombs.

Unless we become cannibals we are likely to die of starvation. If we do

become cannibals, Mr. Dod," she added, sternly endeavouring to look

Dicky in the eye, "I hope you will remember what ish due to ladies."
"I will offer myself up gladly," said he, and I could not help

reflecting upon the comfort of a third party with a sense of humour

under the circumstances.
"Thass right," said Mrs. Portheris, nodding approvingly, and much

oftener than was necessary. "Though there isn't much on you—you won't

go very far." Then after a moment of gloomy reflection she blew out her

candle, and, before I could prevent it, mine also. Dicky hastily put his

out of reach.
"Three candles at once," she said virtuously, "in a room of this size!

It is wicked extravagance, neither more nor less."
I assure you you would have laughed, even in the Catacombs, and Dicky

and I mutually approached the borders of hysteria in our misplaced

mirth. Mrs. Portheris smiled in unison somewhat foolishly, and we saw

that slumber was overtaking her. Gradually and unconsciously she slipped

down and back, and presently rested comfortably in the sepulchre of her

selection, sound asleep.
"She is right in it," said Dicky, holding up his candle. "She's a lulu,"

he added disgustedly, "with her eucalyptus."
This was disrespectful, but consider the annoyance of losing a third of

our forces against seven million Early Christian ghosts. We sat down,

Dicky and I, with our backs against the tomb of Mrs. Portheris, and when

Dicky suggested that I might like him to hold my hand for a little while

I made no objection whatever. We decided that the immediate prospect,

though uncomfortable, was not alarming, that we had been wandering about

for possibly an hour, judging by the dwindling of Dicky's candle, and

that search must be made for us as soon as ever the others went above

ground and heard from Brother Demetrius the tale of our abandonment. I

said that if I knew anything about momma's capacity for underground

walking, the other party would have gone up long ago, and that search

for us was, therefore, in all likelihood, proceeding now, though perhaps

it would be wiser, in case we might want them, to burn only one candle

at a time. We had only to listen intently and we would hear the voices

of the searchers. We did listen, but all that we heard was a faint far

distant moan, which Dicky tried to make me believe was the wind in a

ventilating shaft. We could also hear a prolonged thumping very close to

us, but that we could each account for personally. And nothing more.
"Dicky," said I after a time, "if it weren't for the candle I believe I

should be frightened."
"It's about the most parsimonious style of candle I've ever seen,"

replied Dicky, "but it would give a little more light if it were

trimmed." And he opened his pocket-knife.
"Be very careful," I begged, and Dicky said "Rather!"
"Did you ever notice," he asked, "that you can touch flame all right if

you are only quick enough? Now, see me take the top off that candle." If

Dicky had a fault it was a tendency to boastfulness. He took the lighted

wick between his thumb and his knife-blade, and skilfully scooped the

top off. It blazed for two seconds on the edge of the blade—just long

enough to show us that all the flame had come with it. Then it went out,

and in the darkness at my side I heard a scuffling among waistcoat

pockets, and a groan.
"No matches?" I asked in despair.
"Left 'em in my light overcoat pockets, Mamie. I'm a bigger ass

than—than Mafferton."
"You are," I said with decision. "No Englishman goes anywhere without

his light overcoat. What have you done with yours?"
"Left it in the carriage," replied Dick humbly.
"That shows," said I bitterly, "how little you have learned in England.

Propriety in connection with you is evidently like water and a duck's

back. An intelligent person would have acquired the light overcoat

principle in three days, and never have gone out without it afterward."
"Oh, go on!" replied Dick fiercely. "Go on. I don't mind. I'm not so

stuck on myself as I was. But if we've got to die together you might as

well forgive me. You'll have to do it at the last moment, you know."
"I suppose you have begun to review your past life," I said grimly, "and

that's why you are using so much American slang."
Then, as Dicky was again holding my hands, I maintained a dignified

silence. You cannot possibly quarrel with a person who is holding your

hand, no matter how you feel.
"There's only one thing that consoles me in connection with those

matches," Dicky mentioned after a time. "They were French ones."
"I don't know what that has to do with it," I said.
"That's because you don't smoke," Dicky replied. And I had not the heart

to pursue the inquiry. Time went on, black and silent, as it had been

doing down there for sixteen centuries. We stopped arguing about why

they didn't come to look for us, each privately wondering if it was

possible that we had strayed too ingeniously ever to be found. We talked

of many things to try to keep up our spirits, the conviction of the St.

James's Gazette that American young ladies live largely upon

chewing-gum, and other topics far removed from our surroundings, but the

effort was not altogether successful. Dicky had just permitted himself

to make a reference to his mother in Chicago when a sound behind us made

us both start violently, and then cheered us immensely—a snore from

Mrs. Portheris within the tomb. It was not, happily, a single accidental

snore, but the forerunner of a regular series, and we hung upon them as

they issued, comforted and supported. We were vaguely aware that we

could have no better defence against disembodied Early Christians, when,

in the course of an hour, Mrs. Portheris sat up suddenly among the bones

of the original occupant and asked what time it was. We felt a pang of

regret at losing it.
After the first moment or two that lady realized the situation

completely. "I suppose," she said, "we have been down here about two

days. I am quite faint with hunger. I have often read that candles,

under these terrible circumstances, are sustaining. What a good thing we

have got the candles."
Dicky squeezed my hand nervously, but our chaperone had slept off the

eucalyptus and had no longer one cannibal thought.
"I don't think it is time for candles yet," he said reassuringly. "You

have been asleep, you know, Mrs. Portheris."
"If you have eaten them already, I consider that you have taken an

unfair advantage, a very unfair advantage."
"Here is mine!" exclaimed Dicky nobly. "I hope I can deny myself, Mrs.

Portheris, to that extent."
"And mine," I echoed; "but really, Mrs. Portheris——"
Another pressure of Dicky's hand reminded me—I am ashamed to confess

it—that if Mrs. Portheris was bent upon the unnecessary consumption of

Roman tallow there was nothing in her past treatment of either of us to

induce us to prevent her. The dictates of humanity, I know, should have

influenced us otherwise, in connection with tallow, but they seemed for

the moment to have faded as completely out of our bosoms as they did out

of the early Roman persecutors! It seemed to me that all my country's

wrongs at the hands of Mrs. Portheris rose up and clamoured to be

avenged, and Dicky told me afterward that he felt just the same way.
"Then I have done you an injustice," she continued; "I apologize, I am

sure, and I find that I have my own candle, thank you. It is adhering to

the side of my bonnet."
We were perfectly silent.
"Perhaps I ought to try and wait a little longer," Mrs. Portheris

hesitated, "but I feel such a sinking, and I assure you I have fallen

away. My garments are quite loose."
"Of course it depends," said Dicky scientifically, "upon the amount of

carbon the system has in reserve. Personally I think I can hold out a

little longer. I had an excellent breakfast this m——, the day we came

here. But if I felt a sinking——"
"Waugh!" said Mrs. Portheris.
"Have you—have you begun?" I exclaimed in agony, while Dicky shook in

silence.
"I have," replied Mrs. Portheris hurriedly; "where—where is the

eucalyptus? Ah! I have it!"
"Ben-en-euh! It is nutritive, I am sure, but it requires a cordial."
The darkness for some reason seemed a little less black and the silence

less oppressive.
"I have only eaten about three inches," remarked Mrs. Portheris

presently. Dicky and I were incapable of conversation—"but I—but I

cannot go on at present. It is really not nice."
"An overdone flavour, hasn't it?" asked Dicky, between gasps.
"Very much so! Horribly! But the eucalyptus will, I hope, enable me to

extract some benefit from it. I think I'll lie down again." And we heard

the sound of a cork restored to its bottle as Mrs. Portheris returned to

the tomb. It was quite half an hour before she woke up, declaring that a

whole night had passed and that she was more famished than ever. "But,"

she added, "I feel it impossible to go on with the candle. There is

something about the wick——"
"I know," said Dicky sympathetically, "unless you are born in Greenland,

you cannot really enjoy them. There is an alternative, Mrs. Portheris,

but I didn't like to mention it——"
"I know," she replied, "shoe leather. I have read of that, too, and I

think it would be an improvement. Have you got a pocket-knife, Mr. Dod?"
Dicky produced it without a pang and we heard the rapid sound of an

unbuttoning shoe. "I had these made to order at two guineas, in the

Burlington Arcade," said Mrs. Portheris regretfully.
"Then," said Dicky gravely, groping to hand her the knife, "they will be

of good kid, and probably tender."
"I hope so, indeed," said Mrs. Portheris; "we must all have some. Will

you—will you carve, Mr. Dod?"
I remembered with a pang how punctilious they were in England about

asking gentlemen to perform this duty, and I received one more

impression of the permanence of British ideas of propriety. But Dicky

declined; said he couldn't undertake it—for a party, and that Mrs.

Portheris must please help herself and never mind him, he would take

anything there was, a little later, with great hospitality. However, she

insisted, and my portion, I know, was a generous one, a slice off the

ankle. Mrs. Portheris begged us to begin; she said it was so cheerless

eating by one's self, and made her feel quite greedy.
"Really," she said, "it is much better than candle—a little difficult

to masticate perhaps, but, if I do say it myself, quite a tolerable

flavour. If I only hadn't used that abominable French polish this

morning. What do you think, Mr. Dod?"
"I think," said Dicky, jumping suddenly to his feet, while my heart

stood still with anticipation, "that if there's enough of that shoe

left, you had better put it on again, for I hear people calling us," and

then, making a trumpet with his hands, Dicky shouted till all the

Roman skeletons sufficiently intact turned to listen. But this time the

answer came back from their descendants, running with a flash of

lanterns.
Dicky shouted till the skeletons turned to listen.
Dicky shouted till the skeletons turned to listen.

I will skip the scene of our reunion, because I am not good at matters

which are moving, and we were all excessively moved. It is necessary to

explain, however, that Brother Demetrius, when he went above ground,

felt his lumbago so acutely that he retired to bed, and was therefore

not visible when the others came up. As we had planned beforehand, the

Senator decided to go on to the Jewish Catacombs, taking it for granted

that we would follow, while Brother Eusebius, when he found Demetrius in

bed, also took it for granted that we had gone on ahead. He did not

inquire, he said, because the virtue of taciturnity being denied to them

in the exercise of their business, they always diligently cultivated it

in private. My own conviction was that they were not on speaking terms.

Our friends and relatives, after looking at the Jewish Catacombs, had

driven back to the hotel, and only began to feel anxious at tea time, as

they knew the English refreshment-rooms were closed for the season, like

everything else, and Isabel asserted with tears that if her mother was

above ground she would not miss her tea. So they all drove back to the

Catacombs, and effected our rescue after we had been immured for exactly

seven hours. I wish to add, to the credit of Mr. Richard Dod, that he

has never yet breathed a syllable to anybody about the manner in which

Mrs. Portheris sustained nature during our imprisonment, although he

must often have been strongly tempted to do so. And neither have

I—until now.

CHAPTER XV.
"The thing that struck me on our drive to the hotel," remarked momma,

"was that Naples was almost entirely inhabited by the lower classes."
"That is very noticeable indeed," concurred Mr. Mafferton, who was also

there for the first time. "The people of the place are no doubt in the

country at this time of the year, but one would naturally expect to see

more respectable persons about."
"Now you'll excuse me, Mafferton," said the Senator, "but that's just

one of those places where I lose the trail of the English language as

used by the original inventors. Where do you draw the line of

distinction between people and persons?"
"It's a mere Briticism, poppa," I observed. Mr. Mafferton loathed being

obliged to defend his native tongue at any point. That very morning the

modus vivendi between us, that I had done so much for Dicky's sake to

establish, had been imperilled by my foolish determination to know

why all Englishmen pronounced "white" "wite."
"I daresay," said poppa gloomily, "but I am not on to it and I don't

suppose I ever shall be. What struck me on the ride up through the city

was the perambulating bath. Going round on wheels to be hired out, just

the ordinary tin tub of commerce. The fellows were shouting

something—'Who'll buy a wash!' I suppose. But that's the disadvantage

of a foreign language; it leaves so much to the imagination."
"The goats were nice," I said, "so promiscuous. I saw one of them

looking out of a window."
"And the dear little horses with bells round their necks," momma added,

"and the tall yellow houses with the stucco dropping off, and especially

the fruit shops and the flower stalls that make pictures down every

narrow street. Such masses of colour!"
"We might have hit on a worse hotel," observed Mr. Mafferton. "Very

tolerable soup, to-night."
"I can't say I noticed the soup," said the Senator. "Fact is, soup to me

is just—soup. I presume there are different kinds, but beyond knowing

most of them from gruel I don't pretend to be a connoisseur."
"What nonsense, Alexander!" said momma sternly.
"Some are saltier than others, Augusta, I admit. But what I was going on

to say was that for clear monotony the dinner programmes ever since

Paris have beaten the record. Bramley told me how it would be. Consommy,

he said—that's soup—consommy, the whole enduring time. Fish frité or

fried, roast beef à l'Italienne or mixed up with vegetables.

Beans—well, just beans, and if you don't like 'em you can leave 'em,

but that fourth course is never anything but beans. After that you get

a chicken cut up with lettuce, because if it was put on the table whole

some disappointed investigator might find out there was nothing inside

and file a complaint. Anything to support that unstuffed chicken? Nope.

Finishing up with a compote of canned fruit, mostly California pears

that want more cooking, and after that cheese, if you like cheese, and

coffee charged extra. Thanks to Bramley, I can't say I didn't know what

to expect, but that doesn't increase the variety any. Now in America—I

understand you have been to America, sir?"
"I have travelled in the States to some extent," responded Mr.

Mafferton.
"Seen Brooklyn Bridge and the Hudson, I presume. Had a look at Niagara

Falls and a run out to Chicago, maybe. That was before I had the

pleasure of meeting you. Get as far as the Yosemite? No? Well, you were

there long enough anyhow to realise that our hotels are run on the free

will system."
"I remember," said Mr. Mafferton. "All the luxuries of the coming

season, printed on a card usually about a foot long. A great variety,

and very difficult to understand. When I had finished trying to

translate the morning paper, I used to attack the card. I found that it

threw quite a light upon early American civilisation from the aboriginal

side. 'Hominy,' 'Grits,' 'Buckwheats,' 'Cantelopes,' are some of the

dishes I remember. 'Succotash,' too, and 'creamed squash,' but I think

they occurred at dinner generally. I used to summon the waiter, and

when he came to take my orders I would ask him to derive those dishes. I

had great difficulty after a time in summoning a waiter. But the plan

gave me many interesting half hours. In the end I usually ordered a

chop."
"I don't want to run down your politics," poppa said, "but that's what I

call being too conservative. Augusta, if you have had enough of the Bay

of Naples and the moon, I might remind you of the buried city of

Pompeii, which is on for to-morrow. It's a good long way out, and you'll

want all your powers of endurance. I'm going down to have a smoke, and a

look at the humorous publications of Italy. There's no sort of

sociability about these hotels, but the head portier knows a little

English."
"I suppose I had better retire," momma admitted, "though I sometimes

wish Mr. Wick wasn't so careful of my nervous system. Delicious scene,

good-night." And she too left us.
We were sitting in a narrow balcony that seemed to jut out of a horn of

the city's lovely crescent. Dicky and Isabel occupied chairs at a

distance nicely calculated to necessitate a troublesome raising of the

voice to communicate with them. Mrs. Portheris was still confined to her

room with what was understood to be the constitutional shock of her

experiences in the Catacombs. Dicky, in joyful privacy, assured me that

nobody could recover from a combination of Roman tallow and French kid

in less than a week, but I told him he did not know the British

constitution.
We were sitting in a narrow balcony.
We were sitting in a narrow balcony.
The moon sailed high over Naples, and lighted the lapping curve of her

perfect bay in the deepest, softest blue, and showed us some of the

nearer houses of the city, sloping and shouldering and creeping down,

that they were pink and yellow and parti-coloured, while the rest curved

and glimmered round the water in all tender tones of white holding up a

thousand lamps. And behind, curving too, the hills stood clear, with the

grey phantom of Vesuvius in sharp familiar lines, sending up its stream

of steady red, and now and then a leaping flame. It was a scene to wake

the latent sentiment of even a British bosom. I thought I would stay a

little longer.
"So you usually ordered a chop?" I said by way of resuming the

conversation. "I hope the chops were tender."
(I have a vague recollection that my intonation was.)
"There are worse things in the States than the mutton," replied Mr.

Mafferton, moving his chair to enable him, by twisting his neck not too

ostentatiously, to glance occasionally at Dicky and Isabel, "but the

steaks were distinctly better than the chops—distinctly."
"So all connoisseurs say," I replied respectfully. "Would you like to

change seats with me? I don't mind sitting with my back to—Vesuvius."
Mr. Mafferton blushed—unless it was the glow from the volcano.
"Not on my account," he said. "By any means."
"You do not fear a demonstration," I suggested. "And yet the forces of

nature are very uncertain. That is your English nerve. It deserves all

that is said of it."
Mr. Mafferton looked at me suspiciously.
"I fancy you must be joking," he said.
He sometimes complained that the great bar to his observation of the

American character was the American sense of humour. It was one of the

things he had made a note of, as interfering with the intelligent

stranger's enjoyment of the country.
"I suppose," I replied reproachfully, "you never pause to think how

unkind a suspicion like that is? When one wishes to be taken

seriously."
"I fear I do not," Mr. Mafferton confessed. "Perhaps I jump rather

hastily to conclusions sometimes. It's a family trait. We get it through

the Warwick-Howards on my mother's side."
"Then, of course, there can't be any objection to it. But when one knows

a person's opinion of frivolity, always to be thought frivolous by the

person is hard to bear. Awfully."
And if my expression, as I gazed past this Englishman at Vesuvius, was

one of sad resignation, there was nothing in the situation to exhilarate

anybody.
The impassive countenance of Mr. Mafferton was disturbed by a ray of

concern. The moonlight enabled me to see it quite clearly. "Pray, Miss

Wick," he said, "do not think that. Who was it that wrote—"

"A little humour now and then
Is relished by the wisest men."

"I don't know," I said, "but there's something about it that makes me

think it is English in its origin. Do you really endorse it?"
"Certainly I do. And your liveliness, Miss Wick, if I may say so, is

certainly one of your accomplishments. It is to some extent a racial

characteristic. You share it with Mr. Dod."
I glanced in the direction of the other two. "They seem desperately

bored with each other," I said. "They are not saying anything. Shall we

join them?"
"Dod is probably sulking because I am monopolising you. Mrs. Portheris,

you see, has let me into the secret"—Mr. Mafferton looked very

arch—"By all means, if you think he ought to be humoured."
"No," I said firmly, "humouring is very bad for Dicky. But I don't think

he should be allowed to wreak his ill-temper on Isabel."
"I have noticed a certain lack of power to take the initiative about

Miss Portheris," said Mr. Mafferton coldly, "especially when her mother

is not with her. She seems quite unable to extricate herself from

situations like the present."
"She is so young," I said apologetically, "and besides, I don't think

you could expect her to go quite away and leave us here together, you

know. She would naturally have foolish ideas. She doesn't know anything

about our irrevocable Past."
"Why should she care?" asked Mr. Mafferton hypocritically.
"Oh," I said. "I don't know, I'm sure. Only Mrs. Portheris——"
"She is certainly a charming girl," said Mr. Mafferton.
"And so well brought up," said I.
"Ye-es. Perhaps a little self-contained."
"She has no need to rely upon her conversation." I observed.
"I don't know. The fact is——"
"What is the fact?" I asked softly. "After all that has passed I think I

may claim your confidence, Mr. Mafferton." I had some difficulty

afterwards in justifying this, but it seemed entirely appropriate at the

time.
"The fact is, that up to three weeks ago I believed Miss Portheris to be

the incarnation of so many unassuming virtues and personal charms that I

was almost ready to make a fresh bid for domestic happiness in her

society. I have for some time wished to marry——"
"I know," I said sympathetically.
"But during the last three weeks I have become a little uncertain."
"There shouldn't be the slightest uncertainty," I observed.
"Marriage in England is such a permanent institution."
"I have known it to last for years even in the United States," I

sighed.
"And it is a serious responsibility to undertake to reciprocate in full

the devotion of an attached wife."
"I fancy Isabel is a person of strong affections," I said; "one notices

it with her mother. And any one who could dote on Mrs. Portheris would

certainly——"
"I fear so," said Mr. Mafferton.
"I understand," I continued, "why you hesitate. And really, feeling as

you do, I wouldn't be precipitate."
"I won't," he said.
"Watch the state of your own heart," I counselled, "for some little

time. You may be sure that hers will not alter;" and, as we said

good-night, I further suggested that it would be a kindness if Mr.

Mafferton would join my lonely parent in the smoking-room.
I don't know what happened on the balcony after that.

CHAPTER XVI.
"Mamma," said Isabel, as we gathered in the hotel vestibule for the

start to Pompeii, "is really not fit to undertake it."
"You'll excuse me, Aunt Caroline," remarked the Senator, "but your

complexion isn't by any means right yet. It's a warm day and a long

drive. Just as likely as not you'll be down sick after it."
"Stuff!" said Mrs. Portheris. "I thank my stars I have got no

enfeebled American constitution. I am perfectly equal to it, thank you."
"It's most unwise," observed Mr. Mafferton.
"Darned—I mean extremely risky," sighed Dicky.
Mrs. Portheris faced upon them. "And pray what do you know about it?"

she demanded.
Then momma put in her oar, taking most unguardedly a privilege of

relationship. "Of course, you are the best judge of how you feel

yourself, Aunt Caroline, but we are told there are some steps to ascend

when we get there—and you know how fleshy you are."
In the instant of ominous silence which occurred while Mrs. Portheris

was getting her chin into the angle of its greatest majesty, Mr.

Mafferton considerately walked to the door. When it was accomplished

she looked at momma sideways and down her nose, precisely in the manner

of the late Mr. Du Maurier's ladies in Punch, in the same state of

mind. She might have sat or stood to him. It was another ideal realised.
"That is the latest, the very latest Americanism which I have observed

in your conversation, Augusta. In your native land it may be admissible,

but please understand that I cannot permit it to be applied to me

personally. To English ears it is offensive, very offensive. It is also

quite improper for you to assume any familiarity with my figure. As you

say, I may be aware of its corpulence, but nobody else—er—can

possibly know anything about it."
Momma was speechless, and, as usual, the Senator came to the rescue. He

never will allow momma to be trampled on, and there was distinct

retaliation in his manner. "Look here, aunt," he said, "there's nothing

profane in saying you're fleshy when you are, you know, and you don't

need to remove so much as your bonnet strings for the general public to

be aware of it. And when you come to America don't you ever insult

anybody by calling her corpulent, which is a perfectly indecent

expression. Now if you won't go back to bed and tranquillise your

mind—on a plain soda——"
"I won't," said Mrs. Portheris.
"De carriages is already," said the head porter, glistening with an

amiability of which we all appreciated the balm. And we entered the

carriages—Mrs. Portheris and the downcast Isabel and Mr. Mafferton in

one, and momma, poppa, Dicky, and I in the other. For no American would

have been safe in Mrs. Portheris's carriage for at least two hours, and

this came home even to Mr. Dod.
"Never again!" exclaimed momma as we rattled down among the narrow

streets that crowd under the Funicular railway. "Never again will I call

that woman Aunt Caroline."
"Don't call her fleshy, my dear, that's what really irritated her,"

remarked the Senator. The Senator's discrimination, I have often

noticed, is not the nicest thing about him.
Hours and hours it seemed to take, that drive to Pompeii. Past the

ambitious confectioner with his window full of cherry pies, each cherry

round and red and shining like a marble, and the plate glass dry-goods

store where ready-made costumes were displayed that looked as if they

might fit just as badly as those of Westbourne Grove, and so by degrees

and always down hill through narrower and shabbier streets where all the

women walked bareheaded and the shops were mostly turned out on the

pavement for the convenience of customers, and a good many of them went

up and down in wheelbarrows. And often through narrow ways so

high-walled and many-windowed that it was quite cool and dusky down

below, and only a strip of sun showed far up along the roofs of one

side. Here and there a wheelbarrow went strolling through these streets

too, and we saw at least one family marketing. From a little square

window a prodigious way up came, as we passed, a cry with custom in it,

and a wheelbarrow paused beneath. Then down from the window by a long,

long rope slid a basket from the hands of a young woman leaning out in

red, and the vendor took the opportunity of sitting down on his barrow

handle till it arrived. Soldi and a piece of paper he took out of the

basket and a cabbage and onions he put in, and then it went swinging

upwards and he picked up his barrow again, and we rattled on and left

him shouting and pushing his hat back—it was not a soft felt but a

bowler—to look up at the other windows. In spite of the bowler it was a

picturesque and Neapolitan incident, and it left us much divided as to

the contents of the piece of paper.
"My idea is," said the Senator, "that the young woman in the red jersey

was the hired girl and that note was what you might call a clandestine

communication."
"Since we are in Naples," remarked Mr. Dod, "I think, Senator, your

deduction is correct. Where we come from a slavey with any self-respect

would put her sentiments on a gilt-edged correspondence card in a

scented envelope with a stamp on the outside and ask you to kindly drop

it into the pillar box on your way to business; but this chimes in with

all you read about Naples."
"Perfectly ridiculous!" said momma. "Mark my words, that note was either

a list of vegetables wanted, or an intimation that if they weren't going

to be fresher than the last, that man needn't stop for orders in

future. And in a country as destitute of elevators as this one is I

suppose you couldn't keep a servant a week if you didn't let her save

the stairs somehow. But I must say if I were going to have cabbage and

onions the same day I wouldn't like the neighbours to know it."
I entirely agreed with momma, and was reflecting, while they talked of

something else, on the injustice of considering ours the sentimental

sex, when the Senator leaned forward and advised me in an undertone to

make a note of the market basket.
"And take my theory to account for the piece of paper," said he; "your

mother's may be the most likely, but mine is what the public will

expect."
And always the shadows of the narrow streets crooked in the end into a

little plaza full of sun and beggars, and lemonade stands, and hawkers

of wild strawberries, and when the great bank of a flower-stall stood

just where the shadow ended sharply and the sun began, it made something

to remember. After that our way lay through a suburban parish fête,

and we pursued it under strings and strings of little glass lanterns,

red, and green, and blue, that swung across the streets; and there were

goats and more children, and momma vainly endeavoured to keep off the

smells with her parasol. Then a region of docks and masts rising

unexpectedly, and many little fish shops, and a glitter of scales on the

pavement, and disconnected coils of rope, and lounging men with

earrings, and unkempt women with babies, and above and over all the

warm scent, standing still in the sun, of hemp, and tar, and the sea.
"The city," said the Senator, casting his practised eye on a piece of

dead wall that ran along the pavement, "is evidently in the turmoil of a

general election, though you mightn't notice it. It's the third time

I've seen those posters 'Viva il Prefétto!' and 'Viva L'opposizione!

That seems to be about all they can do, just as if we contented ourselves

with yelling ''Rah for Bryan!' 'One more for McKinley!' I must say if they

haven't any more notion of business than that they don't either of 'em

deserve to get there."
"In France," observed Mr. Dod, "they stick up little handbills addressed

to their 'chers concitoyens' as if voters were a lot of baa-lambs and

willie-boys. It makes enervating reading."
"Young man," said poppa in a burst of feeling, "they say the American

eagle might keep her beak shut with advantage, more than she does; but I

tell you," and the Senator's hand came down hard on Dicky's knee, "a

trip around Europe is enough to turn her into a singing bird, sir, a

singing bird."
I don't get my imagination entirely from momma.
"Viva il Prefétto! Viva L'opposizione!" poppa repeated pityingly, as

another pair of posters came in sight. "Well, it won't ever do the

Government of Italy any good, but I guess I'm with the Opposizione."
The road grew emptier and sandy white, and commerce forsook it but for

here and there a little shop with fat yellow bags, which were the

people's cheeses, hanging in bladders at the door. Crumbled gateways

began to appear, and we saw through them that the villa gardens inside

ran down and dropped their rose leaves into the blue of the

Mediterranean. We met the country people going their ways to town; they

looked at us with friendly patronage, knowing all about us, what we had

come to see, and the foolishness of it, and especially the ridiculous

cost of carozza that take people to Pompeii. And at last, just as the

sun and the jolting and the powdery white dust combined had instigated

us all to suggest to the Senator how much better it would have been to

come by rail, the ponies made a glad and jingling sweep under the

acacias of the Hôtel Diomede, which is at the portals of Pompeii.
It seemed a casual and a cheerful place, full of open doors and

proprietary Neapolitans who might have been brothers and sisters-in-law,

whose conversation we interrupted coming in. There had been domestic

potations; a very fat lady, with a horn comb in her hair, wiped liquid

rings off the table with her apron, removing the glasses, while a

collarless male person with an agreeable smile and a soft felt hat

placed wooden chairs for us in a row. Poppa knows no Italian, but they

seemed to understand from what he said that we wanted things to drink,

and brought us with surprising accuracy precisely what each of us

preferred, lemonade for momma and me, and beverages consisting largely,

though not entirely, of soda water for the Senator and Mr. Dod. While

we refreshed ourselves, another, elderly, grizzled, and one-eyed, came

and took up a position just outside the door opposite and sang a song of

adventurous love, boxing his own ears in the chorus with the liveliest

effect. A further agreeable person waited upon us and informed us that

he was the interpreter, he would everything explain to us, that this was

a beggar man who wanted us to give him some small money, but there was

no compulsion if we did not wish to do so. I think he gave us that

interpretation for nothing. The fat lady then produced a large fan which

she waved over us assiduously, and the collarless man in the soft hat

stood by to render aid in any further emergency, smiling upon us as if

we were delicacies out of season. Poppa bore it as long as he could, and

we all made an unsuccessful effort to appear as if we were quite

accustomed to as much attention and more in the hotels of America; but

in a very few minutes we knew all the disadvantages of being of too much

importance. Presently the one-eyed man gave way to a pair of players on

the flute and mandolin.
"Look here," said poppa at this, to the interpreter, "you folks are

putting yourselves out on our account a great deal more than is

necessary. We are just ordinary travelling public, and you don't need to

entertain us with side shows that we haven't ordered any more than if we

belonged to your own town. See?" But the interpreter did not see. He

beckoned instead to an engaging daughter of the fat lady, who approached

modestly with a large book of photographs, which she opened before the

Senator, kneeling beside his chair.
"Great Scott!" exclaimed poppa, "I'm not a crowned head. Rise, Miss

Diomede."
Removing his cigar, he assisted the young lady to her feet and led her

to a sofa at the other end of the room, where, as they turned over the

photographs together, I heard him ask her if she objected to tobacco.
"You may go," said momma to the interpreter, "and explain the scenes.

Mr. Wick will enjoy them much more if he understands them." The freedom

from conventional restraint which characterises American society very

seldom extends to married gentlemen.
We had to wait twenty minutes for the other party, on account of their

British objection to anybody's dust. Even Mr. Mafferton looked quelled

when they arrived, and Isabel quite abject, while Mrs. Portheris wore

that air of justification which no circumstance could impair, which was

particularly her own. She would not sit down. "It gives these people a

claim on you," she said. "I did not come here to run up an hotel bill,

but to see Pompeii. Pompeii I demand to see." The players on the flute

and mandolin looked at Mrs. Portheris consideringly and then strolled

away, and the guide, with a sorrowful glance at the landlady, put on his

hat. "I can explain you everything," he said with an inflection that

placed the responsibility for remaining in ignorance upon our own heads,

but Mrs. Portheris waved him away with her fan. "No," she said. "I beg

that this man shall not be allowed to inflict himself upon our party.

I particularly desire to form my own impression of the historic city,

that city that did so much for the reputation of Sir Henry Bulwer

Lytton. Besides, these people mount up ridiculously, and with servants

at home on half wages, and Consols in the state they are, one is really

compelled to economise."
"I'm not a crowned head!"
"I'm not a crowned head!"
It was difficult to protest against Mrs. Portheris's regulations, and

impossible to contravene them, so I have nothing to report of that guide

but his card, which bore the name "Antonio Plicco," and his memory,

which is a blank.
There was an ascent, and Mrs. Portheris mounted it proudly. I pointed

out to poppa half-way up that his esteemed relative hadn't turned a

hair, but he was inclined to be incredulous; said you couldn't tell what

was going on in the Department of the Interior. The Senator often uses a

political reference to carry him over a delicate allusion. Flowering

shrubs and bushes lined the path we climbed, silent in the sunshine,

dustily decorative, and at the top the turning of a key let us into a

strange place. Always a strange place, however often the guide-books

beat their iterations upon it, a place that leaps at imagination,

peering into other days through the mists that lie between, and blinds

it with a rush of light—the place where they have gathered together

what was left of the dead Pompeiians and their world. There they lay

before us for our wonderment as they ran, and tripped, and struggled,

and fell in the night of that day when they and the gods together were

overwhelmed, and they died as they thought in the end of time. And

through an open door Vesuvius sent up its eternal gentle woolly curl

again the daylight sky, and vineyards throve, and birds sang, and we,

who had survived the gods, came curious to look. The figures lay in

glass cases, and Dicky remarked, with unusual seriousness, that it was

like a dead-house.
"Except," said poppa, "that in this mortuary there isn't ever going to

be anybody who can identify the remains. When you come to think of

it—that's kind of hard."
"No chance of Christian burial once you get into a museum," said Dick

with solicitude.
"I should like," remarked Mrs. Portheris, polishing her pince nez to

get a better view of a mother and daughter lying on their faces. "I

should like to see the clergyman who would attempt it. These people were

heathen, and richly deserved their fate. Richly!"
Momma looked at her husband's Aunt Caroline with indignant scorn. "Do

you really think so?" she asked, but we could all see that her words

were a very inadequate expression for her emotions. Mrs. Portheris drew

all the guns of her orthodoxy into line for battle. "I am surprised——"

she began, and then the Senator politely but firmly interfered.
"Ladies," he said, "'De mortuis nisi bonum,' which is to say it isn't

customary to slang corpses, especially, as you may say, in their

presence. I guess we can all be thankful, anyhow, that heathen nowadays

have got a cooler earth to live on," and that for the moment was the end

of it, but momma still gazed commiseratingly at the figures, with a

suspicious tendency to look for her handkerchief.
"It's too terrible," she said. "We can actually see their features."
"Don't let them get on your nerves, Augusta," suggested poppa.
"I won't if I can help it. But when you see their clothes and their hair

and realise——"
"It happened over eighteen hundred years ago, my dear, and most of them

got away."
"That didn't make it any better for those who are now before us," and

momma used her handkerchief threateningly, though it was only in

connection with her nose.
"Well now, Augusta, I hate to destroy an illusion like that, because

they're not to be bought with money, but since you're determined to work

yourself up over these unfortunates, I've got to expose them to you.

They're not the genuine remains you take them for. They're mere

worthless imitations."
"Alexander," said momma suspiciously, "you never hesitate to tamper with

the truth if you think it will make me any more comfortable. I don't

believe you."
"All right," returned the Senator; "when we get home you ask Bramley. It

was Bramley that put me on to it. Whenever one of those Pompeii fellows

dropped, the ashes kind of caked over him, and in the course of time

there was a hole where he had been. See? And what you're looking at is

just a collection of those holes filled up with composition and then dug

out. Mere holes!"
"The illusion is dreadfully perfect," sighed momma. "Fancy dying like a

baked potato in hot ashes! Somehow, Alexander, I don't seem able to get

over it," and momma gazed with distressed fascination at the grim form

of the negro porter.
"We've got no proper grounds for coming to that conclusion either,"

replied poppa firmly. "Just as likely they were suffocated by the gas

that came up out of the ground."
"Oh, if I could think that!" momma exclaimed with relief. "But if I find

you've been deceiving me, Alexander, I'll never forgive you. It's too

solemn!"
"You ask Bramley," I heard the Senator reply. "And now come and tell me

if this loaf of bread somebody baked eighteen hundred and twenty

something years ago isn't exactly the same shape as the Naples bakers

are selling right now."
"Daughter," said momma as she went, "I hope you are taking copious

notes. This is the wonder of wonders that we behold to-day." I said I

was, and I wandered over to where Mrs. Portheris examined with Mr.

Mafferton an egg that was laid on the last day of Pompeii. Mrs.

Portheris was asking Mr. Mafferton, in her most impressive manner, if it

was not too wonderful to have positive proof that fowls laid eggs then

just as they do now; and I made a note of that too. Dicky and Isabel

bemoaned the fate of the immortal dog who still bites his flank in the

pain extinguished so long ago. I hardly liked to disturb them, but I

heard Dicky say as I passed that he didn't mind much about the humans,

they had their chance, but this poor little old tyke was tied up, and

that on the part of Providence was playing it low down.
Then we all stepped out into the empty streets of Pompeii and Mr.

Mafferton read to us impressively, from Murray, the younger Pliny's

letter to Tacitus describing its great disaster. The Senator listened

thoughtfully, for Pliny goes into all kinds of interesting details. "I

haven't much acquaintance with the classics," said he, as Mr. Mafferton

finished, "but it strikes me that the modern New York newspaper was the

medium to do that man justice. It's the most remarkable case I've

noticed of a good reporter born before his time."
"A terrible retribution," said Mrs. Portheris, looking severely at the

Tavern of Phœbus, forever empty of wine-bibbers. "They worshipped

Jupiter, I understand, and other deities even less respectable. Can we

wonder that a volcano was sent to destroy them! One thing we may be

quite sure of—if the city had only turned from its wickedness and

embraced Christianity, this never would have happened."
Momma compressed her lips and then relaxed them again to say, "I think

that idea perfectly ridiculous." I scented battle and hung upon the

issue, but the Senator for the third time interposed.
"Why no, Augusta," he said, "I guess that's a working hypothesis of Aunt

Caroline's. Here's Vesuvius smokin' away ever since just the same, and

there's Naples with a bishop and the relics of Saint Januarius. You can

read in your guide-book that whenever Vesuvius has looked as if he meant

business for the past few hundred years, the people of Naples have

simply called on the bishop to take out the relics of Saint Januarius

and walk 'em round the town; and that's always been enough for Vesuvius.

Now the Pompeii folks didn't know a saint or a bishop by sight, and

Jupiter, as Aunt Caroline says, was never properly qualified to

interfere. That's how it was, I presume. I don't suppose the people of

Naples take much stock in the laws of nature; they don't have to, with

Januarius in a drawer. And real estate keeps booming right along."
"You have an extraordinary way of putting things," remarked Mrs.

Portheris to her nephew. "Very extraordinary. But I am glad to hear that

you agree with me," and she looked as if she did not understand momma's

acquiescent smile.
We went our several ways to see the baths, and the Comic Theatre, the

bakehouse and the gymnasium; and I had a little walk by myself in the

Street of Abundance, where the little empty houses waited patiently on

either side for those to return who had gone out, and the sun lay full

on their floors of dusty mosaic, and their gardens where nothing grew.

It seemed to me, as it seems to everybody, that Pompeii was not dead,

but asleep, and her tints were so clear and gay that her dreams might be

those of a ballet-girl. A solitary yellow dog chased a lizard in the

sun, and the pebbles he knocked about made an absurdly disturbing noise.

Beyond the vague tinted roofless walls that stretched over the pleasant

little peninsula, the blue sea rippled tenderly, remembering much

delight, and the place seemed to smile in its sleep. It was easy to

understand why Cicero chose to have his villa in the midst of such

light-heartedness, and why the gods, perhaps, decided that they had lent

too much laughter to Pompeii. I made free of the hospitality of

Cornelius Rufus and sat for a while in his exedra, where he himself,

in marble on a little pillar in the middle of the room, made me as

welcome as if I had been a client or a neighbour. We considered each

other across the centuries, making mutual allowances, and spent the most

sociable half-hour. I take a personal interest in the city's disaster

now—it overwhelmed one of my friends.

CHAPTER XVII.
On the Lungarno in Florence, in the cool of the evening, we walked

together, the Senator, momma, Dicky, and I. Dicky radiated depression,

if such a thing is atmospherically possible; we all moved in it. Mr. Dod

had been banished from the Portheris party, and he groaned over the

reflection that it was his own fault. At Pompeii I had exerted myself in

his interest to such an extent that Mr. Mafferton detached himself from

Mrs. Portheris and attached himself to momma for the drive home. Little

did I realise that one could be too agreeable in a good cause. Dicky

insinuated himself with difficulty into Mr. Mafferton's vacant place

opposite Mrs. Portheris, and even before the carriages started I saw

that he was going to have a bad time. His own version of the experience

was painful in the extreme, and he represented the climax as having

occurred just as they arrived at the hotel. The unfortunate youth must

have been goaded to his fate, for his general attitude toward matters of

orthodoxy was most discreet.
"There is something Biblical," said Mrs. Portheris (so Dicky related),

"that those Pompeiian remains remind me of, and I cannot think what it

is."
"Lot's wife, mamma?" said Isabel.
"Quite right, my child—what a memory you have! That wretched woman

who stopped to look back at the city where careless friends and

relatives were enjoying themselves, indifferent to their coming fate, in

direct disobedience to the command. Of course, she turned to salt, and

these people to ashes, but she must have looked very much like them when

the process was completed."
That was Dicky's opportunity for restraint and submission, but he seemed

to have been physically unable to take it. He rushed, instead, blindly

to perdition. "I don't believe that yarn," he said.
There was a moment's awful silence, during which Dicky said he counted

his heart-beats and felt as if he had announced himself an atheist or a

Jew, and then his sentence fell.
"In that case, Mr. Dod, I must infer that you are opposed to the

doctrine of the complete inspiration of Holy Writ. If you do not believe

in that, I shudder to think of what you may not believe in. I will say

no more now, but after dinner I will be obliged to speak to you for a

few minutes, privately. Thank you, I can get out without assistance."
And after dinner, privately, Dicky learned that Mrs. Portheris had for

some time been seriously considering the effect of his, to her,

painfully flippant views, upon the opening mind of her daughter—the

child had only been out six months—and that his distressing

announcement of this morning left her in no further doubt as to her

path of duty. She would always endeavour to have as kindly a

recollection of him as possible, he had really been very obliging, but

for the present she must ask him to make some other travelling

arrangements. Cook, she believed, would always change one's tickets less

ten per cent., but she would leave that to Dicky. And she hoped, she

sincerely hoped, that time would improve his views. When that was

accomplished she trusted he would write and tell her, but not before.
"And while I'm getting good and ready to pass an examination in Noah,

Jonah, and Methuselah," remarked Dicky bitterly, as we discussed the

situation on the Lungarno for the seventh time that day, "Mafferton

sails in."
"Why didn't you tell her plainly that you wanted to marry Isabel, and

would brook no opposition?" I demanded, for my stock of sympathy was

getting low.
"Now that's a valuable suggestion, isn't it?" returned Mr. Dod with

sarcasm. "Good old psychological moment that was, wasn't it? Talk about

girls having tact! Besides, I've never told Isabel herself yet, and I'm

not the American to give in to the effete and decaying custom of asking

a girl's poppa, or momma if it's a case of widow, first. Not Richard

Dod."
"What on earth," I exclaimed, "have you been doing all this time?"
"Now go slow, Mamie, and don't look at me like that. I've been trying to

make her acquainted with me—explaining the kind of fellow I

am—getting solid with her. See?"
"Showing her the beauties of your character!" I exclaimed derisively.
"I said something about the defects, too," said Dicky modestly, "though

not so much. And I was getting on beautifully, though it isn't so easy

with an English girl. They don't seem to think it's proper to analyse

your character. They're so maidenly."
"And so unenterprising," I said, but I said it to myself.
"Isabel was actually beginning to lead up to the subject," Dicky went

on. "She asked me the other day if it was true that all American men

were flirts. In another week I should have felt that she would know what

was proposing to her."
"And you were going to wait another week?"
"Well, a man wants every advantage," said Dicky blandly.
"Did you explain to Isabel that you were only joining our party in the

hope of meeting her accidentally soon again?"
"What else," asked he in pained surprise, "should I have joined it for?

No, I didn't; I hadn't the chance, for one thing. You took the first

train back to Rome next morning, you know. She wasn't up."
"True," I responded. "Momma said not another hour of her husband's Aunt

Caroline would she ever willingly endure. She said she would spend her

entire life, if necessary, in avoiding the woman." But Dicky had not

followed the drift of my thought.
I added vaguely, "I hope she will understand it"—I really couldn't be

more definite—and bade Mr. Dod good-night. He held my hand

absent-mindedly for a moment, and mentioned the effectiveness of the

Ponte Vecchio from that point of view.
"I didn't feel bound to change my tickets less ten per cent.," he said

hopefully, "and we're sure to come across them early and often. In the

meantime you might try and soften me a little—about Lot's wife."
Next day, in the Ufizzi, it was no surprise to meet the Miss Binghams.

We had a guilty consciousness of fellow-citizenship as we recognised

them, and did our best to look as if two weeks were quite long enough to

be forgotten in, but they seemed charitable and forgiving on this

account, said they had looked out for us everywhere, and had we seen

the cuttings in the Vatican?
"The statues, you know," explained Miss Cora kindly, seeing that we did

not comprehend. "Marvellous—simply marvellous! We enjoyed nothing so

much as the marble department. It takes it out of you though—we were

awfully done afterwards."
I wondered what Phidias would have said to the "cuttings," and whether

the Miss Binghams imagined it a Briticism. It also occurred to me that

one should never mix one's colloquialisms; but that, of course, did not

prevent their coming round with us. I believe they did it partly to

diffuse their guide among a larger party. He was hanging, as they came

up, upon Miss Cora's reluctant earring, so to speak, and she was

mechanically saying, "Yes! Yes! Yes!" to his representations. "I

suppose," said she inadvertently, "there is no way of preventing their

giving one information," and after that when she hospitably pressed the

guide upon us we felt at liberty to be unappreciative.
I regret to write it of two maiden ladies of good New York family, and a

knowledge of the world; but the Miss Binghams capitulated to Dicky Dod

with a promptness and unanimity which would have been very bad for him

if nobody had been there to counteract its effects. He walked between

them through the vestibules, absorbing a flow of tribute from each side

with a complacency which his recent trying experiences made all the more

profound. There was always a something, Miss Nancy declared, about an

American who had made his home in England—you could always tell. "In

your case, Mr. Dod, there is an association of Bond Street. I can't

describe it, but it is there. I hope you don't mind my saying so."
"Oh, no," said Dicky, "I guess it's my tailor. He lives in Bond Street;"

but this was artless and not ironical. Miss Cora went further. "I should

have taken Mr. Dod for an Englishman," she said, at which the

miscalculated Mr. Dod looked alarmed.
"Is that so?" he responded. "Then I'll book my passage back at once.

I've been over there too long. You see I've been kind of obliged to

stay for reasons connected with the firm, but you ladies can take my

word for it that when you get through this sort of ridiculous veneer

I've picked up you'll find a regular all-wool-and-a-yard-wide

city-of-Chicago American, and I'm bound to ask you not to forget it.

This English way of talking is a thing that grows on a fellow

unconsciously, don't you know. It wears off when you get home."
At which Miss Cora and Miss Nancy looked at each other smilingly and

repeated "Don't you know" in derisive echo, and we all felt that our

young friend had been too modest about his acquirements.
"But we mustn't neglect our old masters," cried Miss Nancy as those of

the first corridor began to slip past us on the walls, with no desire to

interrupt. "What do you think of this Greek Byzantine style, Mr. Wick?

Somehow it doesn't seem to appeal to me, though whether it's the

flatness—or what——"
"It is flat, certainly," agreed the Senator, "but that's a very

popular style of angel for Christmas cards—the more expensive kinds.

Here, I suppose, we get the original."
"That is Tuscan school, sir—madam," put in the guide, "and not

angel—Saint Cecilia. Fourteen century, but we do not know that artiss

his name. In the book you will see Cimabue, but it is not

Cimabue—unknown artiss."
"Dear me!" cried momma. "St. Cecilia, of course. Don't you remember her

expression—in the Catacombs?"
"She's sweet, always and everywhere," said Miss Cora, as we moved on,

leaving the guide explaining St. Cecilia with his hands behind his back.

"And you did go to Capri after all? Now I wonder, Nancy, if they had our

experience about the oysters?"
"A horrid little man!" cried momma.
"Who showed you the way to the steamer——"
"And hung around doing things the whole enduring time," continued my

parent, as Mark Antony's daughter turned her head aside, and Drusus, the

brother of Tiberius, frowned upon our passing.
"He must have been our man!" cried both the Misses Bingham, with

excitement.
"In the manner of Taddeo Gaddi," interrupted the guide, surprising us on

the flank with a Holy Family.
"All right," said the Senator. "Well, this fellow proposed to bring our

party oysters on the steamer, and we took him, of course, for the

steward's tout——"
"Exactly what we thought."
"Since you are going to tell the story, Alexander, I may remind you

that he said they were the best in the world," remarked momma, with

several degrees of frost.
"My dear, the anecdote is yours. But you remember I told him they

wouldn't be in it with Blue Points."
"Now what," exclaimed Miss Nancy, with excitement, "did he ask you for

them?"
"Three francs a head, Nancy, wasn't it, Mrs. Wick? And you gave the

order, and the man disappeared. And you thought he'd gone to get them;

at least, we did. Nancy here had perfect confidence in him. She said he

had such dog-like eyes, and we were both perfectly certain they would be

served when the steamer stopped at the Blue Grotto——" Miss Cora paused

to smile.
"But they weren't," suggested momma feebly.
"No, indeed, and hadn't the slightest intention of being." Miss Nancy

took up the tale. "Not until we were taking off our gloves in the hotel

verandah, and making up our minds to a good hot lunch, did those oysters

appear—exactly half a dozen, and bread and butter extra! And we

couldn't say we hadn't ordered them. And the lunch was only two francs

fifty, complet. But we felt we ought to content ourselves with the

oysters, though, of course, you wouldn't with gentlemen in your party.

Now, what course did you pursue, Mrs. Wick?"
"Really," said momma distantly, "I don't remember. I believe we had

enough to eat. Surely that is little Moses being taken from the

bulrushes! How it adds to one's interest to recognise the subject."
"By B. Luti," responded Miss Nancy. "I hope he isn't very well known,

for I never heard of him before. Now, there's a Domenichino; I can tell

it from here. I do love Domenichino, don't you?"
I suppose the Senator knew that momma didn't love Domenichino, and would

possibly be at a loss to say why; at all events, he remarked that,

talking of Capri, he hoped the Miss Binghams had not felt as badly about

inconveniencing the donkeys that took them to the top of the cliff as

momma had. "Mrs. Wick," he informed them, "rode an ass by the name of

Michael Angelo, perfectly accustomed to the climate, and, do you believe

it, she held her parasol over that animal's head the whole way." At

which everybody laughed, and momma, invested with an original and

amiable weakness, was appeased.
"Of Michelangelo we have not here much," said the guide patiently.

"Drawings yes, and one holy Family—magnificent! But all in another room

w'ich——"
"Now what Bramley said about the Ufizzi was this," continued the

Senator. "'You'll see on those walls,' he said, 'the best picture show

in the world, both for pedigree and quality of goods displayed. I'd go

as far as to say they're all worth looking at, even those that have been

presented to the institution. But don't you look at them,' Bramley said,

'as a whole. You keep all your absorbing-power for one apartment,' he

said—'the Tribune. You'll want it.' Bramley gave me to understand that

it wasn't any use he didn't profess to be able to describe his sublimer

emotions, but when he sat down in the Tribune he had a sort of

instinctive idea that he'd got the cream of it—he didn't want to go any

further."
We decided, therefore, in spite of such minor attractions as those of

Niobe and her daughters, at once to achieve the Tribune, feeling, as

poppa said, that it would be most unfortunate to have our admiration all

used up before we reached it. The guide led the way, and it was beguiled

with the fascinating experience of the Miss Binghams, who had met Queen

Marguerite driving in the Villa Borghese at Rome and had received a bow

from her Majesty of which nothing would ever be able to deprive them.

"Of course we drew up to let her pass," said Miss Nancy, "and were

careful not to make ourselves in any way conspicuous, merely standing up

in the carriage as an ordinary mark of respect. And she looked charming,

all in pink and white, with a faded old maid of honour that set her off

beautifully, didn't she, Cora? And such a pretty smile she gave us—they

say she likes the better class of Americans."
"Oh, we've nothing to regret about Rome," rejoined Cora. "Even Peter's

toe. I wouldn't have kissed it at the time if the guide hadn't said it

was really Jupiter's. I was sure our dear vicar wouldn't mind my kissing

Jupiter's toe. But now I'm glad I did it in any case. People always ask

you that."
When we arrived at the little octagonal treasure chamber Mr. Dod and

Miss Cora sat down together on one of the less conspicuous sofas, and I

saw that Dicky was already warmed to confidence. Momma at once gave up

her soul to the young St. John, having had an engraving of it ever since

she was a little girl, and the Senator went solemnly from canvas to

canvas on tip-toe with a mind equally open to Job and the Fornarina. He

assured Miss Nancy and me that Bramley was perfectly right in thinking

everything of the Tribune, and with reference to the Dancing Fawn, that

it was worth a visit to see Michael Angelo's notion of executing repairs

to statuary alone. He gave the place the benefit of his most serious

attention, pulling his beard a good deal before Titian's Venus (which

poppa always did in connection with this goddess, however, entirely

apart from the merit of the painting) and obviously making allowances

for her of Medici on account of her great age. At the end of the hour we

spent there it had the same effect upon him as upon Colonel Bramley, he

did not wish to go any further; and we parted from the Miss Binghams,

who did. As I said good-bye to Miss Cora she gave my hand a subtly

sympathetic pressure, whispered tenderly, "He's very nice," and

roguishly escaped before I could ask who was, or what difference it

made. Having thought it over, I took the first opportunity of inquiring

of Dicky how much of his private affairs he had unburdened to Miss Cora.

"Oh," said he, "hardly anything. She knows a former young lady friend of

mine in Syracuse—we still exchange Christmas cards—and that led me on

to say I thought of getting married this winter. Of course I didn't

mention Isabel."

CHAPTER XVIII.
Out of indulgence to Dicky we lingered in Florence three or four days

longer than was at all convenient, considering, as the Senator said, the

amount of ground we had to cover before we could conscientiously recross

the Channel. But neither poppa nor momma were people to desert a

fellow-countryman in distress in foreign parts, especially in view of

this one's pathetic reliance upon our sympathy and support, as a family.

We all did our best toward the distraction of what momma called his poor

mind, though I cannot say that we were very successful. His poor mind

seemed wholly taken up with one anticipative idea, and whatever failed

to minister to that he hadn't, as poppa sadly said, any use for. The

cloisters of San Marco had no healing for his spirit, and when we

directed his attention to the solitary painting on the wall with which

Fra Angelico made a shrine of each of its monastic cubicles he merely

remarked that it was more than you got in most hotels, and turned

joylessly away. Even the charred stick that helped to martyr Savonarola

left him cold. He said, indifferently, that it was only the natural

result of mixing up politics and religion, and that certain Chicago

ministers who supported Bryan from the pulpit might well take warning.

But his words were apathetic; he did not really care whether those

Chicago ministers went to the stake or not. We stood him before the

bronze gates of Ghiberti, and walked him up and down between rows of

works in pietra dura, but without any permanent effect, and when he

contemplated the consecrated residences of Cimabue and Cellini, we could

see that his interest was perfunctory, and that out of the corner of his

eye he really considered passing fiacres. I read to him aloud from

"Romola," and momma bought him an English and Italian washing book that

he might keep a record of his camicie and his fazzoletti—it would

be so interesting afterwards, she thought—while the Senator exerted

himself in the way of cheerful conversation, but it was very

discouraging. Even when we dined at the fashionable open air restaurant

in the Cascine, with no less a person than Ouida, in a fluff of grey

hair and black lace, at the next table, and the most distinguished

gambler of the Italian aristocracy presenting a narrow back to us from

the other side, he permitted poppa to compare the quality of the beef

fillets unfavourably with those of New York in silence, and drank his

Chianti with a lack-lustre eye.
Towards the end of the week, however, Dicky grew remorseful. "It's all

very well," he said to me privately, "for Mrs. Wick to say that she

could spend a lifetime in Florence, if the houses only had a few modern

conveniences. I daresay she could—and as for your poppa, he's as

patient as if this were a Washington hotel and he had a caucus every

night, but it's as plain as Dante's nose that the Senator's dead sick of

this city."
"Dicky," I said, "that is a reflection of your own state of mind. Poppa

is willing to take as much more Botticelli and Filippo Lippi as it may

be necessary to give him."
"Oh, I know he would" Dicky admitted, "but he isn't as young as he

was, and I should hate to feel I was imposing on him. Besides, I'm

beginning to conclude that they've skipped Florence."
So it came to pass that we departed for Venice next day, tarrying one

night at Bologna. We had cut a day off Bologna for Dicky's sake, but the

Senator could not be persuaded to sacrifice it altogether on account of

its well known manufacture, into the conditions of which he wished to

inquire. The shops, as we drove to the hotel, seemed to expose nothing

else for sale, but poppa said that, in spite of the local consumption,

it had certainly fallen off, and, as an official representative of one

of its great rivals in the west, he naturally felt a compunctious

interest in the state of the industry. The hotel had a little courtyard,

with an orange tree in the middle and palms in pots, and we came down

the wide marble stairs, past the statues on the landing, and the

paintings on the walls, to find dinner laid on round tables out there, I

remember. A note of momma's occurs here to the effect that there is a

great deal too much fine art in Italian hotels, with a reference to the

fact that the one at Naples had the whole of Pompeii painted on the

dining room walls. She considers this practice embarrassing to the

public mind, which has no way of knowing whether to admire these things

or not, though personally we boldly decided to scorn them all. This,

however, has nothing to do with poppa and the commercial traveller. We

knew he was a commercial traveller by the way he put his toothpick in

his pocket, though poppa said afterwards that he was not exceptionally

endowed for that line of business. He was dining at our table, and by

his gratified manner when we sat down, it was plain that he could speak

English and would be very pleased to do so. Poppa, knowing that his time

was short, began at once.
"You belong to Bologna, sir?" he inquired with his first spoonful of

soup. For some reason it seems impossible to address a stranger at a

table d'hôte, before the soup takes the baldness off the situation.
The gentleman smiled. He had a broad, open, amiable, red face, with a

short black beard and a round head covered with thick hair in curls,

beautifully parted. "I do not think I belong," he said; "my house of

business, it is at Milan, and I am born at Finalmarina. But I come much

to Bologna, yes."
"Where did you say you were born?" asked the Senator.
"Finalmarina. You did not go to there, no? I am sorry."
"It does seem a pity," replied poppa, "but we've been obliged to pass a

considerable number of your commercial centres, sir. This city, I

presume, has large manufacturing interests?"
"Oh, yes, I suppose. You 'ave seen that San Petronio, you cannot help.

Very enorm'! More big than San Peter in Rome. But not complete since

fourteenth century. In America you 'ave nothing unfinish, is it not?"
"Far as that goes," said poppa, "we generally manage to complete our

contracts within the year; as a rule, I may say within the building

season. But I have seen one or two Roman Catholic churches left with the

scaffolding hanging round the ceiling for a good deal longer, the altar

all fixed up too, and public worship going on just as usual. It seems to

be a way they have. Well, sir, I knew Bologna, by reputation, better

than any other Italian city, for years. Your local manufacture did the

business. As a boy at school, there was nothing I was more fond of for

my dinner. Thirty years ago, sir, the interest was created that brings

me here to-day."
The commercial traveller bowed with much gratification. In the meantime

he had presented a card to momma, which informed her that Ricardo

Bellini represented the firm of Isapetti and Co., Milan, Artificial

Flowers and Lace.
"Thirty years, that is a long time to remember Bologna, I cannot say

that thirty years I remember New York. You will not believe!" He was

obviously not more than twenty-five, so this was vastly humorous.

"Twenty years, yes, twenty years I will say! And have you seen San

Stefano? Seven churches in one! Also the most old. And having forty

Jerusalem martyrs."
"Forty would go a long way in relics," the Senator observed with

discouragement, "but my remarks had reference to the Bologna sausage,

sir."
"Sausage—ah! mortadella—yes they make here I believe." Mr. Bellini

held up his knife and fork to enable his plate to be changed and looked

darkly at the succeeding course. "But every Italian cannot like that

dish. I eat him never. You will not find in this hotel no." His manner

indicated a personal hostility to the Bologna sausage, but the Senator

did not seem to notice it.
"You don't say so! Local consumption going off too, eh? Now how do you

explain that?"
Mr. Bellini shrugged his shoulders. "It is much eat by the poor people.

They will always have that mortadella!"
"That looks," said the Senator thoughtfully, "like the production of an

inferior article. But not necessarily, not necessarily, of course."
"Bologna it is very ecclesiastic." Mr. Bellini addressed my other

parent, recovering a smile. "We have produced here six popes. It is the

fame of Bologna."
"You seem to think a great deal of producing popes in Italy," momma

replied coldly. "I should consider it a terrible responsibility."
"Now do you suppose," said poppa confidentially, "that the idea of

trichinosis had anything to do with slackening the demand?"
Mr. Bellini threw his head back, and passionately replaced a section of

biscuit and cheese in the middle of his plate.
"I know nossing, any more than you! Why you speak me always that Bologna

sausage! Pazienza! What is it that sausage to make the agreeable

conversation!"
"Sir," exclaimed the Senator with astonishment and equal heat, "you

don't seem to be aware of it, but at one time the Bologna sausage ruled

the world!"
Mr. Bellini, however, could evidently not trust himself to discuss the

matter further. He rose precipitately with an outraged, impersonal bow,

and left the table, abandoning his biscuit and cheese, his half finished

bottle of Rudesheimer and the figs that were to follow, with the

indifference of a lofty nature.
"I'm sorry I spoiled his dinner," said poppa with concern, "but if a

Bologna man can't talk about Bologna sausages, what can he talk about?"
It made the Senator reticent, though, as to sausages of any kind, with

the other commercial traveller—the hotel was full of them, and we found

it very entertaining after the barren dining rooms of southern

Italy—with whom we breakfasted. He spoke to this one exclusively about

the architectural and historic features of the city, in a manner which

forbade any approach to gastronomic themes, and while the second

commercial traveller regarded him with great respect, it must be

confessed that the conversation languished. Dicky might have helped us

out, but Dicky was following his usual custom of having rooms in one

hotel and covering as many others as possible with his meals, in the

hope of an accidental meeting. This was excellent as a distraction for

his mind, but since it occasionally led him into three déjeuners and

two dinners, rather bad, we feared, for other parts of him. He had

confided his design to me; he intended, on meeting Isabel's eye, to turn

very pale, abruptly terminate his repast, ask for his hat and stick, and

walk out with conspicuous agitation. As to the course he meant to pursue

afterwards he was vague; the great thing was to make an impression upon

Isabel. We differed about the nature of the impression. Dicky took it

for granted that she would be profoundly affected, but he made no

allowance for the way in which maternal vigilance like that of Mrs.

Portheris can discourage the imagination.
Poppa made two further attempts to inform himself upon the leading

manufacturing interest of Bologna. He inquired of the padrone, who was

pleased to hear that Bologna had a leading manufacturing interest, and

when my parent asked where he could see the process, pointed out several

shops in the Piazza Maggiore. One of these the Senator visited,

note-book in hand, and was shown with great alacrity every variety of

mortadella, from delicacies the size of a finger to mottled

conceptions as thick as a small barrel. He found a difficulty in

explaining, however, even with an Italian phrase book, that it was the

manufacture only about which he was curious, and that, admirable as the

result might be, he did not wish to buy any of it. When the latter fact

finally made itself plain, the proprietor became truculent and gave us,

although he spoke no English, so vivid an idea of the inconsistency of

our presence in his premises, that we retired in all the irritation of

the well-meaning and misunderstood. The Senator, however, who had

absolute confidence in his phrase book, saw a deeper significance in the

remarkable unwillingness of the people of Bologna to expatiate upon the

feature which had given them fame. "The fact is," said he gloomily,

restoring his note-book to his inside pocket as we entered the

terra-cotta doorway of St. Catarina, "they're not anxious to let a

stranger into the know of it." And this conviction remaining with him,

still inspires the Senator with a contemptuous pity for the porcine

methods of a people who refuse to submit them to the light of day and

the observation of the world at large.

CHAPTER XIX.
So far, momma said she had every reason to be pleased with the effect on

her mind. About the Senator's she would not commit herself, beyond

saying that we had a great deal to be thankful for in that his health

hadn't suffered, in spite of the indigestibility of that eternal French

twist and honey that you were obliged on the Continent to begin the day

with. She hoped, I think, that the Senator had absorbed other things

beside the French twist equally unconsciously, with beneficial results

that would appear later. He said himself that it was well worth

anybody's while to make the trip, if only in order to be better

satisfied with America for the rest of his life, but why people

belonging to the United States and the nineteenth century should want to

spend whole summers in the Middle Ages he failed to understand. Both my

parents, however, looked forward to Venice with enthusiasm. Momma

expected it to be the realization of all her dreams, and poppa decided

that it must, at all events, be unique. It couldn't have any Arno or any

Campagna in the nature of things—that would be a change—and it was not

possible to the human mind, however sophisticated, with a livelong

experience of street cars and herdics, to stroll up and take a seat in

a gondola and know exactly what would happen, where the fare-box was and

everything, and whether they took Swiss silver, and if a gentleman in a

crowded gondola was expected to give up his seat to a lady and stand.

Poppa, as a stranger and unaccustomed to the motion, hoped this would

not be the case, but I knew him well enough to predict that if it were

so he would vindicate American gallantry at all risks.
Thus it was that, from the moment momma put her head out of the car

window, after Mestre, and exclaimed, "It's getting wateryer and

wateryer," Venice was a source of the completest joy and satisfaction to

both my parents. Dicky and I took it with the more moderate appreciation

natural to our years, but it gave us the greatest pleasure to watch the

simple and unrestrained delight of momma and poppa, and to revert, as it

were, in their experience, to what our own enjoyment might have been had

we been born when they were. "No express agents, no delivery carts, no

baggage checks," murmured poppa, as our trunks glided up to the hotel

steps, "but it gets there all the same." This was the keynote of his

admiration—everything got there all the same. The surprise of it was

repeated every time anything got there, and was only dashed once when we

saw brown-paper parcels being delivered by a boy at the back door of the

Palazzo Balbi, who had evidently walked all the way. The Senator

commented upon that boy and his groceries as an inconsistency, and

thereafter carefully closed his eyes to the fact that even our own

hotel, which faced upon the Grand Canal, had communications to the rear

by which its guests could explore a large part of commercial Venice

without going in a gondola at all. The canals were the only highways he

would recognise, and he went three times to St. Maria della Salute,

which was immediately opposite, for the sake of crossing the street in

the Venetian way. Momma became really hopeful about the stimulus to his

imagination; she told him so. "It appeals to you, Alexander," she said.

"Its poetry comes home to you—you needn't deny it;" and poppa cordially

admitted it. "Yes," he said, "Ruskin, according to the guide-book,

doesn't seem as if he could say too much about this city, and Bramley

was just the same. They're both right, and if we were going to be here

long enough I'd be like that myself. There's something about it that

makes you willing to take a lot of trouble to describe it. There's no

use saying it's the canals, or the reflections in the water, or the

bridges, or the pigeons, or the gargoyles, or the gondolas——"
"Or Salviati, or Jesurum," said momma, in lighter vein.
"Your memory, Augusta, for the names of old masters is perfectly

wonderful," continued poppa placidly. "Or Salviati, or Jesurum, or what.

But there's a kind of local spell about this place——"
"There are various kinds of local smells," interrupted Dicky, whom Mrs.

Portheris still evaded, but this levity received no encouragement from

the Senator. He said instead that he hadn't noticed them himself. For

his part he had come to Venice to use his eyes, not his nose; and Dicky,

thus discouraged, faded visibly upon his stem.
I could see that poppa was still strongly under the influence of the

Venetian sentiment when he invited me to go out in a gondola with him

after dinner, and pointedly neglected to suggest that either momma or

Dicky should come too. I had a presentiment of his intention. If I have

seemed, thus far, to omit all reference to Mr. Page in Boston, since we

left Paris, it is, first, because I believe it is not considered

necessary in a book of travels to account for every half hour, and

second, because I privately believed him to be in correspondence with

the Senator the whole time, and hesitated to expose his duplicity. I had

given poppa opportunities for confessing this clandestine business, but

in his paternal wisdom he had not taken them. I was not prepared,

therefore, to be very responsive when, from a mere desire to indulge his

sense of the fitness of things, poppa endeavoured to probe my sentiments

with regard to Mr. Page by moonlight on the Grand Canal. To begin with,

I wasn't sure of them—so much depended upon what Arthur had been doing;

and besides, I felt that the perfect confidence which should exist

between father and daughter had already been a good deal damaged at the

paternal end. So when poppa said that it must seem to me like a dream,

so much had happened since the day momma and I left Chicago at

twenty-four hours' notice, six weeks ago, I said no, for my part I had

felt pretty wide awake all the time; a person had to be, I ventured to

add, with no more time to waste upon Southern Europe than we had.
"You mean you've been sleeping pretty badly," said the Senator

sympathetically.
"Where was it," I inquired, "you would give us pounded crabs and cream

for supper after we'd been to hear masses for the repose of somebody's

soul? That was a bad night, but I don't think I've had any others. On

the contrary."
"Oh, well," said poppa, "it's a good thing it isn't undermining your

constitution," but he looked as if it were rather a disappointment.
"The American constitution can stand a lot of transportation," I

remarked. "Railways live on that fact. I've heard you say so yourself,

Senator."
Then there was an interval during which the oars of the gondoliers

dipped musically, and the moon made a golden pathway to the marble steps

of the Palazzo Contarina. Then poppa said, "I refer to the object of our

tour."
"The object of our tour wasn't to undermine my constitution," I replied.

"It was to write a book—don't you remember. But it's some time since

you made any suggestions. If you don't look out, the author of that

volume will practically be momma."
The Senator allowed himself to be diverted. "I think," he said, "you'd

better leave the chapter on Venice to me; you can't just talk anyhow

about this city. I'll write it one of these nights before I go to bed."
"But the main reason," he continued, "that sent us to glide this minute

over the canal system of the Bride of the Adriatic was the necessity of

bracing you up after what you'd been through."
"Well," I said, "it's been very successful. I'm all braced up. I'm glad

we have had such a good excuse for coming." A fib is sometimes necessary

to one's self-respect.
"Premé!" cried the gondolier, and we shaved past the gondola of a

solitary gentleman just leaving the steps of the Hotel Britannia.
"That was a shave!" poppa exclaimed, and added somewhat inconsequently,

"You might just as well not speak so loud."
"I've always liked Arty," he continued, as we glided on.
"So have I," I returned cordially.
"He's in many ways a lovely fellow," said poppa.
"I guess he is," said I.
"I don't believe," ventured my parent, "that his matrimonial ideas have

cooled down any."
"I hope he may marry well," I said. "Has he decided on Frankie Turner?"
"He has come to no decision that you don't know about. Of course, I have

no desire to interfere where it isn't any of my business, but if you

wish to gratify your poppa, daughter, you will obey him in this matter,

and permit Arthur once more to—to come round evenings as he used to. He

is a young man of moderate income, but a very level head, and it is the

wish of my heart to see you reconciled."
"Sorry I can't oblige you, poppa," I said. I certainly was not going to

have any reconciliation effected by poppa.
"You'd better just consider it, daughter. I don't want to interfere—but

you know my desire, my command."
"Senator," said I, "you don't seem to realise that it takes more than a

gondola to make a paternal Doge. I've got to ask you to remember that I

was born in Chicago. And it's my bed time. Gondolier! Albergo! Andate

presto!"
"He seems to understand you," said poppa meekly.
So we dropped Arthur—dropped him, so to speak, into the Grand Canal,

and I really felt callous at the time as to whether he should ever come

up again.
But the Senator's joy in Venice found other means of expressing itself.

One was an active and disinterested appeal to the gondoliers to be a

little less modern in their costume. He approached this subject through

the guide with every gondolier in turn, and the smiling impassiveness

with which his suggestions were received still causes him wonder and

disgust. "I presume," he remonstrated, "you think you earn your living

because tourists have got to get from the Accademia to St. Mark's, and

from St. Mark's to the Bridge of Sighs, but that's only a quarter of the

reason. The other three-quarters is because they like to be rowed there

in gondolas by the gondoliers they've read about, and the gondoliers

they've read about wore proper gondoliering clothes—they didn't look

like East River loafers."
"They are poor men, these gondolieri," remarked the guide. "They

cannot afford."
"I am not an infant, my friend. I'm a business man from Chicago. It's a

business proposition. Put your gondoliers into the styles they wore when

Andrea Dandolo went looting Constantinople, and you'll double your

tourist traffic in five years. Twice as many people wanting gondolas,

wanting guides, wanting hotel accommodation, buying your coloured glass

and lace flounces—why, Great Scott! it would pay the city to do the

thing at the public expense. Then you could pass a by-law forbidding

gondoliering to be done in any style later than the fifteenth century.

Pay you over and over again."
Poppa was in earnest, he wanted it done. He was only dissuaded from

taking more active measures to make his idea public by the fact that he

couldn't stay to put it through. He was told, of course, how the plain

black gondola came to be enforced through the extravagance of the nobles

who ruined themselves to have splendid ones, and how the Venetians

scrupled to depart from a historic mandate, but he considered this a

feeble argument, probably perpetuated by somebody who enjoyed a monopoly

in supplying Venice with black paint. "Circumstances alter cases," he

declared. "If that old Doge knew that the P. and O. was going to run

direct between Venice and Bombay every fortnight this year, he'd tell

you to turn out your gondolas silver-gilt!"
Nevertheless, as I say, the Senator's views were coldly received, with

one exception. A highly picturesque and intelligent gondolier, whom the

guide sought to convert to a sense of the anachronism of his clothes in

connection with his calling, promised that if we would give him a

definite engagement for next day, he would appear suitably clad. The

following morning he awaited us with honest pride in his Sunday apparel,

which included violently checked trousers, a hard felt hat, and a large

pink tie. The Senator paid him hurriedly and handsomely and dismissed

him with as little injury to his feelings as was possible under the

circumstances. "Tell him," said poppa to the guide, "to go home and take

off those pants. And tell him, do you understand, to rush!"
That same day, in the afternoon, I remember, when we were disembarking

for an ice at Florian's, momma directed our attention to two gentlemen

in an approaching gondola. "There's something about that man," she said

impressively, "I mean the one in the duster, that belongs to the reign

of Louis Philippe."
"There is," I responded; "we saw him last in the Petit Trianon. It's

Mr. Pabbley and Mr. Hinkson. Two more Transatlantic fellow-travellers.

Senator, when we meet them shall we greet them?"
The Senator had a moment of self-expostulation.
"Well, no," he said, "I guess not. I don't suppose we need feel obliged

to keep up the acquaintance of every American we come across in

Europe. It would take us all our time. But I'd like to ask him what use

he finds for a duster in Venice."
"How I wish the Misses Bingham could hear you," I thought, but one

should never annoy one's parents unnecessarily, so I kept my reflections

to myself.

CHAPTER XX.
That last day in Venice we went, I remember, to the Lido. Nothing

happened, but I don't like leaving it out, because it was the last day,

and the next best thing to lingering in Venice is lingering on it. We

went in a steamboat, under protest from poppa, who said it might as well

be Coney Island until we got there, when he admitted points of

difference, and agreed that if people had to come all the way out in

gondolas, certain existing enterprises might as well go out of business.

The steamer was full of Venetians, and we saw that they were charming,

though momma wishes it to be understood that the modern Portia wears her

bodice cut rather too low in the neck and gazes much too softly at the

modern Bassanio. Poppa and I thought it mere amiability that scorned to

conceal itself, but momma referred to it otherwise, admitting, however,

that she found it fascinating to watch.
We seemed to disembark at a restaurant permanent among flowing waters,

so prominent was this feature of the island, but it had only a roof, and

presently we noticed a little grass and some bushes as well. The verdure

had quite a novel look, and we decided to discourage the casual person

who wished to sell us strange and uncertified shell fish from a basket

for immediate consumption, and follow it up.
Dicky was of opinion that we might arrive at the vegetable gardens of

Venice, but in this we were disappointed. We came instead to a

street-car, and half a mile of arbour, and all the Venetians pleasurably

preparing to take carriage exercise. The horses seemed to like the idea

of giving it to them, they were quite light-hearted, one of them

actually pawed. They were the only horses in Venice, they felt their

dignity and their responsibility in a way foreign to animals in the

public service, anywhere else in the world. Personally we would have

preferred to walk to the other end of the arbour, but it would have

seemed a slight, and, as the Senator said, we weren't in Venice to hurt

anybody's feelings that belonged there. It would have been extravagant

too, since the steamboat ticket included the drive at the end. So we

struggled anxiously for good places, and proceeded to the other side

with much circumstance, enjoying ourselves as hard as possible. Dicky

said he never had such a good time; but that was because he had

exhausted Venice and his patience, and was going on to Verona next day.
The arbour and the grass and the street-car track ended sharply and all

together at a raised wooden walk that led across the sand to a pavilion

hanging over the Adriatic, and here we sat and watched other Venetians

disporting themselves in the water below. They were glorious creatures,

and they disported themselves nobly, keeping so well in view of the

pavilion and such a steady eye upon the spectators that poppa had an

impulsive desire to feed them with macaroons. He decided not to; you

never could tell, he said, what might be considered a liberty by

foreigners; but he had a hard struggle with the temptation, the aquatic

accomplishments we saw were so deserving of reward. I had the misfortune

to lose a little pink rose overboard, as it were, and Dicky looked

seriously annoyed when an amphibious young Venetian caught it between

his lips. I don't know why; he was one of the most attractive on view,

but I have often noticed Turkish tendencies in Dicky where his

country-women are concerned. We came away almost immediately after, so

that rose will bloom in my memory, until I forget about it, among

romances that might have been.
Strolling back, we bought a Venetian secret for a sou or two, a

beautiful little secret, I wonder who first found it out. A picturesque

and fishy smelling person in a soft felt hat sold it to us—a pair of

tiny dainty dried sea-horses, "mère" and "père" he called them. And

there, all in the curving poise of their little heads and the twist of

their little tails, was revealed half the art of Venice, and we saw how

the first glass worker came to be told to make a sea green dragon

climbing over an amber yellow bowl, and where the gondola borrowed its

grace. They moved us to unanimous enthusiasm, and we utterly refused to

let Dicky put one in his button-hole.
It is looking back upon Venice, too, that I see the paternal figure of

the Senator nourishing the people with octopuses. This may seem

improbable, but it is strictly true. They were small octopuses, not

nearly large enough to kill anybody while they were alive, though boiled

and pickled they looked very deadly. Pink in colour, they stood in a

barrel near the entrance, I remember, of Jesurum's, and attracted the

Senator's inquiring eye. When the guide said they were for human

consumption poppa looked at him suspiciously and offered him one. He ate

it with a promptness and artistic despatch that fascinated us all,

gathering it up by its limp long legs and taking bites out of it, as if

it were an apple. A one-eyed man who hooked pausing gondolas up to the

slippery steps offered to show how it should be done, and other

performers, all skilled, seemed to rise from the stones of the pavement.

Poppa invited them all, by pantomime, to walk up and have an octopus,

and when the crowd began to gather from the side alleys, and the

enthusiasm grew too promiscuous, he bought the barrel outright and

watched the carnival from the middle of the canal. He often speaks of

his enjoyment of the Venetian octopus, eaten in cold blood, without

pepper, salt, or vinegar; and the effect, when I am not there, is

awe-stricken.
Next morning we took a gondola for the station, and slipped through the

gold and opal silence of the dawn on the canals away from Venice. No

one was up but the sun, who did as he liked with the façades and the

bridges in the water, and made strange lovelinesses in narrow darkling

places, and showed us things in the calli that we did not know were in

the world. The Senator was really depressing until he gradually

lightened his spirits by working out a scheme for a direct line of

steamships between Venice and New York, to be based on an agreement with

the Venetian municipality as to garments of legitimate gaiety for the

gondoliers, the re-nomination of an annual Doge, who should be compelled

to wear his robes whenever he went out of doors, and the yearly

resurrection of the ancient ceremony of marrying Venice to the Adriatic,

during the months of July and August, when the tide of tourist traffic

sets across the Atlantic. "We should get every school ma'am in the

Union, to begin with," said poppa confidently, and by the time we

reached Verona he had floated the company, launched the first ship,

arrived in Venice with full orchestral accompaniment, and dined the

imitation Doge—if he couldn't get Umberto and Crispi—upon clam chowder

and canvas-backs to the solemn strains of Hail Columbia played up and

down the Grand Canal. "If it could be worked," said poppa as we

descended upon the platform, "I'd like to have the Pope telephone us a

blessing on the banquet."

CHAPTER XXI.
It was the middle of the afternoon, and momma, having spent the morning

among the tombs of the Scaligeri, was lying down. The Scaligeri somehow

had got on her nerves; there were so many of them, and the panoply of

their individual bones was so imposing.
"Daughter," she had said to me on the way back to the hotel, "if you

point out another thing to me I'll slap you." In that frame of mind it

was always best to let momma lie down. The Senator had letters to write;

I think he wanted to communicate his Venetian steamship idea to a man in

Minneapolis. Dicky had already been round to the Hotel di Londres—we

were at the Colomba—and had found nothing, so when he asked me to come

out for a walk I prepared to be steeped in despondency. An unsuccessful

love affair is a severe test of friendship; but I went.
It was as I expected. Having secured a spectator to wreak his gloom

upon, Mr. Dod proceeded to make the most of the opportunity. He put his

hat on recklessly, and thrust his hands into his pa—his trouser

pockets. We were in a strange town, but he fastened his eyes moodily

upon the pavement, as if nothing else were worth considering. As we

strolled into the Piazza Bra, I saw him gradually and furtively turn up

his coat-collar, at which I felt obliged to protest.
"Look here, Dicky," I said, "unrequited affection is, doubtless, very

trying, but you're too much of an advertisement. The Veronese are

beginning to stare at you; their sorcerers will presently follow you

about with their patent philters. Reform your personal appearance, or

here, at the foot of this statue of Victor Emmanuel, I leave you to your

fate."
Dicky reformed it, but with an air of patience under persecution which I

found hard to bear. "I don't know your authority for calling it

unrequited," he said, with dignity.
"All right—undelivered," I replied. "That is a noble statue—you can't

contradict the guide-book. By Borghi."
"Victor Emmanuel, is it? Then it isn't Garibaldi. You don't have to

travel much in Italy to know it's got to be either one or the other.

What they like is to have both," said Mr. Dod, with unnecessary

bitterness. "I'd enjoy something fresh in statues myself." Then, with an

imperfectly-concealed alertness, "There seems to be something going on

over there," he added.
We could see nothing but an arched door in a high, curving wall, and a

stream of people trickling in. "Probably only one of their eternal Latin

church services," continued Dicky. "It's about the only form of public

entertainment you can depend on in this country. But we might as well

have a look in." He went on to say, as we crossed the dusty road, that

my unsympathetic attitude was enough to drive anybody to the Church of

Rome, even in the middle of the afternoon.
But we perceived at once that it was not the Church of Rome, or any

other church. There was more than one arched entrance, and a man in

each, to whom people paid a lira apiece for admission, and when we

followed them in we found our feet still upon the ground, and ourselves

among a forest of solid buttresses and props. The number XV. was cut

deep over the door we came in by, and the props had the air of centuries

of patience. A wave of sound seemed to sweep round in a circle inside

and spend itself about us, of faint multitudinous clappings. Conviction

descended upon us suddenly, and as we stumbled after the others we

shared one classic moment of anticipation, hurrying and curious in 1895

as the Romans hurried and were curious in 110, a little late for the

show in the Arena. They were all there before us, they had taken the

best places, and sat, as we emerged in our astonishment, tier above tier

to the row where the wall stopped and the sky began, intent,

enthusiastic. The wall threw a new moon of shadow on the west, and there

the sun struck down sharply and made splendid the dyes in the women's

clothes, and turned the Italian soldiers' buttons into flaming jewels.

And again, as we stared, the applause went round and up, from the yellow

sand below to the blue sky above, and when we looked bewildered down

into the Arena for the victorious gladiator, and saw a tumbling clown

with a painted face instead, the illusion was only half destroyed. We

climbed and struggled for better places, treading, I fear, in our

absorption on a great many Veronese toes. Dicky said when we got them

that you had to remember that the seats were Roman in order to

appreciate them, they were such very cold stone, and they sloped from

back to front, for the purpose, as we found out afterward from the

guide-book, of letting off the rain water. We were glad to understand

it, but Dicky declared that no explanation would induce him to take a

season ticket for the Arena, it was too destitute of modern

improvements. It was something, though, to sit there watching, with the

ranged multitude, a show in a Roman Amphitheatre—one could imagine

things, lictors and ædiles, senators and centurions. It only required

the substitution of togas and girdled robes for trousers and petticoats,

and a purple awning for the emperor, and a brass-plated body-guard with

long spears and hairy arms and legs, and a few details like that. If one

half closed one's eyes it was hardly necessary to imagine. I was half

closing my eyes, and wondering whether they had Vestal Virgins at this

particular amphitheatre, and trying to remember whether they would turn

their thumbs up or down when they wished the clown to be destroyed, when

Dicky grew suddenly pale and sprang to his feet.
"I was afraid it might give one a chill," I said, "but it is very

picturesque. I suppose the ancient Romans brought cushions."
Mr. Dod did not appear to hear me.
"In the third row below," he exclaimed, blushing joyfully, "the sixth

from this end—do you see? Yellow bun under a floral hat—Isabel!"
"A yellow bun under a floral hat," I repeated, "that would be Isabel, if

you add a good complexion and a look of deportment. Yes, now I see her.

Mrs. Portheris on one side, Mr. Mafferton on the other. What do you want

to do?"
"Assassinate Mafferton," said Dicky. "Does it look to you as if he had

been getting there at all."
"So far as one can see from behind, I should say he has made some

progress, but I don't think, Dicky, that he has arrived. He is

constitutionally slow," I added, "about arriving."
At that moment the party rose. Without a word we, too, got on our feet

and automatically followed, Dicky treading the reserved seats of the

court of Berengarius as if they had been the back rows of a Bowery

theatre. The classics were wholly obscured for him by a floral hat and a

yellow bun. I, too, abandoned my speculations cheerfully, for I expected

Mrs. Portheris, confronted with Dicky, to be more entertaining than any

gladiator.
We came up with them at the exit, and that august lady, as we

approached, to our astonishment, greeted us with effusion.
"Do you see?"
"Do you see?"
"We thought," she declared, "that we had lost you altogether. This is

quite delightful. Now we must reunite!" Dicky was certainly included.

It was extraordinary. "And your dear father and mother," went on Mrs.

Portheris, "I am longing to hear their experiences since we parted.

Where are you? The Colomba? Why what a coincidence! We are there, too!

How small the world is!"
"Then you have only just arrived," said Mr. Dod to Miss Portheris, who

had turned away her head, and was regarding the distant mountains.
"Yes."
"By the 11.30 p.m.?"
"No. By the 2.30 p.m."
"Had you a pleasant journey up from Naples?"
"It was rather dusty."
I saw that something quite awful was going on and conversed volubly with

Mrs. Portheris and Mr. Mafferton to give Dicky a chance, but in a moment

I, too, felt a refrigerating influence proceeding from the floral hat

and the bun for which I could not account.
"Where have you been?" inquired Dicky, "if I may ask."
"At Vallombrosa."
There was also a parasol and it twisted indifferently.
"Ah—among the leaves! And were they as thick as William says they are?"
"I don't understand you." And, indeed, this levity assorted

incomprehensively with the black despair that sat on Dicky's

countenance. It was really very painful in spite of Mrs. Portheris's

unusual humanity and Mr. Mafferton's obvious though embarrassed joy, and

as Mrs. Portheris's cab drove up at the moment I made a tentative

attempt to bring the interview to a close. "Mr. Dod and I are walking,"

I said.
"Ah, these little strolls!" exclaimed Mrs. Portheris, with benignant

humour. "I suppose we must condone them now!" and she waved her hand,

rolling away, as if she gave us a British matron's blessing.
"Oh, don't!" I cried. "Don't condone them—you mustn't!" But my words

fell short in a cloud of dust, and even Dicky, wrapped in his tragedy,

failed to receive an impression from them.
"How," he demanded passionately, "do you account for it?"
"Account for what?" I shuffled.
"The size of her head—the frost—the whole bally conversation!"

propounded Dicky, with tears in his eyes.
I have really a great deal of feeling, and I did not rebuke these terms.

Besides, I could see only one way out of it, and I was occupied with the

best terms in which to present it to Dicky. So I said I didn't know, and

reflected.
"She isn't the same girl!" he groaned.
"Men are always talking in the funny columns of the newspapers," I

remarked absently, "about how much better they can throw a stone and

sharpen a pencil than we can."
Mr. Dod looked injured. "Oh, well," he said, "if you prefer to talk

about something else——"
"But they can't see into a sentimental situation any further than into a

board fence," I continued serenely. "My dear Dick, Isabel thinks you're

engaged. So does her mamma. So does Mr. Mafferton."
"Who to?" exclaimed Mr. Dod, in ungrammatical amazement.
"I looked at him reproachfully. Don't be such an owl!" I said.
Light streamed in upon Dicky's mind. "To you!" he exclaimed. "Great

Scott!"
"Preposterous, isn't it?" I said.
"I should ejaculate! Well, no, I mean—I shouldn't ejaculate, but—oh,

you know what I mean——"
"I do," I said. "Don't apologise."
"What in my aunt's wardrobe do they think that for?"
"You left their party and joined ours rather abruptly at Pompeii," I

said.
"Had to!"
"Isabel didn't know you had to. If she tried to find out, I fancy she

was told little girls shouldn't ask questions. It was Lot's wife who

really came between you, but Isabel wouldn't have been jealous of Lot's

wife."
"I suppose not," said Dicky doubtfully.
"Do you remember meeting the Misses Bingham in the Ufizzi? and telling

them you were going to be——"
"That's so."
"You didn't give them enough details. And they told me they were going

to Vallombrosa. And when Miss Cora said good-bye to me she told me you

were a dear or something."
"Why didn't you say I wasn't?"
"Dicky, if you are going to assume that it was my fault——"
"Only one decent hotel—hardly anybody in it—foregathered with old lady

Portheris—told every mortal thing they knew! Oh," groaned Dicky. "Why

was an old maid ever born!"
"She never was," I couldn't help saying, but I might as well not have

said it. Dicky was rapidly formulating his plan of action.
"I'll tell her straight out, after dinner," he concluded, "and her

mother, too, if I get a chance."
"Do you know what will happen?" I asked.
"You never know what will happen," replied Dicky, blushing.
"Mrs. and Miss Portheris and Mr. Mafferton will leave the Hotel Colomba

for parts unknown, by the earliest train to-morrow morning."
"But Mrs. Portheris declares that we're to be a happy family for the

rest of the trip."
"Under the impression that you are disposed of, an impression that

might be allowed to——"
"My heart," said Dicky impulsively, "may be otherwise engaged, but my

alleged mind is yours for ever. Mamie, you have a great head."
"Thanks," I said. "I would certainly tell the truth to Isabel, as a

secret, but——"
"Mamie, we cut our teeth on the same——"
"Horrid of you to refer to it."
"It's such a tremendous favour!"
"It is."
"But since you're in it, you know, already—and it's so very

temporary—and I'll be as good as gold——"
"You'd better!" I exclaimed. And so it was settled that the fiction of

Dicky's and my engagement should be permitted to continue to any extent

that seemed necessary until Mr. Dod should be able to persuade Miss

Portheris to fly with him across the Channel and be married at a Dover

registry office. We arranged everything with great precision, and, if

necessary, I was to fly too, to make it a little more proper. We were

both somewhat doubtful about the necessity of a bridesmaid in a registry

office, but we agreed that such a thing would go a long way towards

persuading Isabel to enter it.
When we arrived at the hotel we found Mrs. Portheris and Mr. Mafferton

affectionately having tea with my parents. Isabel had gone to bed with a

headache, but Dicky, notwithstanding, displayed the most unfeeling

spirits. He drove us all finally to see the tomb of Juliet in the Vicolo

Franceschini, and it was before that uninspiring stone trough full of

visiting cards, behind a bowling green of suburban patronage, that I

heard him, on general grounds of expediency, make contrite advances to

Mrs. Portheris.
"I think I ought to tell you," he said, "that my views have undergone a

change since I saw you."
Mrs. Portheris fixed her pince nez upon him in suspicious inquiry.
"I can even swallow the whale now," he faltered, "like Jonah."

CHAPTER XXII.
After two days of the most humid civility Mrs. Portheris had brought

momma round. It was not an easy process, momma had such a way of fanning

herself and regarding distant objects; and Dicky and I observed its

difficulties with great satisfaction, for a family matter would be the

last thing anybody would venture to discuss with momma under such

circumstances, and we very much preferred that Mrs. Portheris's

overflowing congratulations should be chilled off as long as possible.

Dicky was for taking my parents into our confidence as a measure of

preparation, but with poppa's commands upon me with regard to Arthur, I

felt a delicacy as to the subject of engagements generally. Besides, one

never can tell whether one's poppa and momma would back one up in a

thing like that.
I never could quite understand Mrs. Portheris's increasingly good

opinion of us at this point. The Senator declared that it was because

some American shares of hers had gone up in the market, but that struck

momma and me as somewhat too general in its application. I preferred to

attribute it to the Senator's Tariff Bill. Mr. Mafferton brought us the

Times one evening in Verona, and pointed out with solemn

congratulation that the name of J.P. Wick was mentioned four times in

the course of its leading article. That journal even said in effect

that, if it were not for the faithfully sustained anti-humorous

character which had established it for so many generations in the

approbation of the British public, it would go so far as to call the

contemplated measure "Wicked legislation." Mr. Mafferton could not

understand why poppa had no desire to cut out the article. He said there

was something so interesting about seeing one's name in print—he always

did it. I was very curious to see instances of Mr. Mafferton's name in

print, and finally induced him to show them to me. They were mainly

advertisements for lost dogs—"Apply to the Hon. Charles Mafferton," and

the reward was very considerable.
But this has nothing to do with the way the plot thickened on the Lake

of Como. I was watching Bellagio slip past among the trees on the left

shore and wondering whether we could hear the nightingales if it were

not for the steamer's engines—which was particularly unlikely as it was

the middle of the afternoon—and thinking about the trifles that would

sometimes divide lives plainly intended to mingle. Mere enunciation, for

example, was a thing one could so soon become reaccustomed to; already

momma had ceased to congratulate me on my broad a's, and I could not

help the inference that my conversation was again unobtrusively

Chicagoan. It was frustrating, too, that I had no way of finding out

how much poppa knew, and extremely irritating to think that he knew

anything. He was sitting near me as I mused, immersed in the American

mail, while momma and his Aunt Caroline insensibly glided towards

intimacy again on two wicker chairs close by. Mr. Mafferton was counting

the luggage somewhere; he was never happy on a steamer until he had done

that; and Isabel was being fervently apologised to by Dicky on the other

side of the deck. I hoped she was taking it in the proper spirit. I had

the terms all ready in which I should accept an apology, if it were

ever offered to me.
Fervent apologies.
Fervent apologies.
"Now, I must not put off any longer telling you how delighted I am at

your dear Mamie's re-engagement."
The statement reached us all, though it was intended for momma only.

Even Mrs. Portheris's more amiable accents had a quality which

penetrated far, with a suggestion of whiskers. I looked again languidly

at Bellagio, but not until I had observed a rapid glance between my

parents, recommending each other not to be taken by surprise.
"Has she confided in you?" inquired momma.
"No—no. I heard it in a roundabout way. You must be very pleased, dear

Augusta. Such an advantage that they have known each other all their

lives!"
Poppa looked guardedly round at me, but by this time I was asleep in my

camp chair, the air was so balmily cool after our hot rattle to Como.
"How did you hear?" he demanded, coming straight to the point, while

momma struggled after tentative uncertainties.
"Oh, a little bird, a little bird—who had it from them both! And much

better, I said when I heard it, that she should marry one of her own

country-people. American girls nowadays will so often be content with

nothing less than an Englishman!"
"So far as that goes," said the Senator crisply, "we never buy anything

we haven't a use for, simply because it's cheap. But I don't mind

telling you that my daughter's re-engagement, on the old American lines,

is a thing I've been wanting to happen for some time."
"And there are some really excellent points about Mr. Dod. We must

remember that he is still very young. He has plenty of time to repair

his fortunes. Of one thing we may be sure," continued Mrs. Portheris

magnanimously, "he will make her a very kind husband."
At this I opened my eyes inadvertently—nobody could help it—and saw

the barometrical change in poppa's countenance. It went down twenty

degrees with a run, and wore all the disgust of an hon. gentleman who

has jumped to conclusions and found nothing to stand on.
"Oh, you're away off there, Aunt Caroline," he said with some annoyance.

"Better sell your little bird and buy a telephone. Richard Dod is no

more engaged to our daughter than the man in the moon."
"Well, I should say not!" exclaimed momma.
"I have it on the best authority," insisted Mrs. Portheris blandly.

"You American parents are so seldom consulted in these matters. Perhaps

the young people have not told you."
This was a nasty one for both the family and the Republic, and I heard

the Senator's rejoinder with satisfaction.
"We don't consider, in the United States, that we're the natural bullies

of our children because we happen to be a little older than they are,"

he said, "but for all that we're not in the habit of hearing much news

about them from outsiders. I'll have to get you to promise not to go

spreading such nonsense around, Aunt Caroline."
"Oh, of course, if you say so, but I should be better satisfied if she

denied it herself," said Mrs. Portheris with suavity. "My information

was so very exact."
I had slumbered again, but it did not avail me. I heard the American

mail dispersing itself about the deck in all directions as the Senator

rose, strode towards my chair, and shook me much more vigorously than

there was any necessity for.
"Here's Aunt Caroline," he said, "wanting us to believe that you and

Dicky Dod are engaged—you two that have quarrelled as naturally as

brother and sister ever since you were born. I guess you can tell her

whether it's very likely!"
I yawned, to gain time, but the widest yawn will not cover more than two

seconds.
"What an extraordinary question!" I said. It sounds weak, but that was

the way one felt.
"Don't prevaricate, Mamie, love," said Mrs. Portheris sternly.
"I'm not—I don't. But n-nothing of the kind is announced, is it?" I was

growing nervous under the Senatorial eye.
"Nothing of the kind exists," said poppa, the Doge all over, except

his umbrella. "Does it?"
"Why no," I said. "Dicky and I aren't engaged. But we have an

understanding."
I was extremely sorry. Mrs. Portheris was so triumphant, and poppa

allowed his irritation to get so much the better of him.
"Oh," he said, "you've got an understanding! Well, you've been too

intelligent, darned if you haven't!" The Senator pulled his beard in his

most uncompromising manner. "Now you can understand something more. I'm

not going to have it. You haven't got my consent and you're not going to

get it."
"But, my dear nephew, the match is so suitable in every respect! Surely

you would not stand in the way of a daughter's happiness when both

character and position—position in Chicago, of course, but still—are

assured!"
Poppa paused, uncertain for an instant whether to turn his wrath upon

his aunt, and that, of course, was my opportunity to plead with my angry

parent. But the knowledge that the hopes which poppa was reducing to

dust and ashes were fervently fixed on a floral hat and a yellow bun

over which he had no control, on the other side of the ship, overcame

me, and I looked at Bellagio to hide my emotions instead, in a way which

they might interpret as obstinate, if they liked.
"Aunt Caroline," said the Senator firmly, "I'll thank you to keep your

spoon out of the preserves. My daughter knows where I have given her

hand, and that's the direction she's going with her feet. Mary, I may as

well inform you that the details of your wedding are being arranged in

Chicago this minute. It will take place within three weeks of our

arrival, and it won't be any slump. But Richard Dod might as well be

told right now that he won't be in it, unless in the capacity of usher.

As I don't contemplate breaking up this party and making things

disagreeable all round, you'll have to tell him yourself. We sail from

Liverpool"—poppa looked at his watch—"precisely one week and four

hours from now, and if Mr. Dod has not agreed to the conditions I

mention by that time we will leave him upon the shore. That's all I have

to say, and between now and then I don't expect you or anybody else to

have the nerve to mention the matter to me again."
After that it was impossible to wink at poppa, or in any way to give him

the assurance that my regard for him was unimpaired. There are things

that can't be passed over with a smile in one's poppa without doing him

harm, and this was one of them. It was a regular manifesto, and I felt

exactly like Lord Salisbury. I couldn't take him seriously, and yet I

had to tell him to come on, if he wanted to, and devote his spare time

to learning the language of diplomacy. So I merely bowed with what

magnificence I could command and filed it, so to speak; and walked to

the other side of the deck, leaving poppa to his conscience and momma

and his Aunt Caroline. I left him with confidence, not knowing which

would give him the worst time. Mrs. Portheris began it, before I was out

of earshot. "For an American parent," she said blandly, "it strikes me,

Joshua, that you are a little severe."
I found Mr. Mafferton interfering, as I expected, with Dicky and Isabel

in their appreciation of the west shore. He was pointing out the Villa

Carlotta at Caddenabbia, and explaining the beauties of the sculptures

there and dwelling on the tone of blue in the immediate Alps and

reminding them that the elder Pliny once picked wild flowers on these

banks, and generally making himself the intelligent nuisance that nature

intended him to be. In spite of it Isabel was radiant. She said a number

of things with the greatest ease; one saw that language, after all, was

not difficult to her, she only wanted practice and an untroubled mind. I

looked at Dicky and saw that a weight had been removed from his, and it

was impossible to avoid the conclusion that peace and satisfaction in

this life would date for these two, if all went well for the next few

days, from the Lake of Como. But all could not be relied upon to go well

so long as Mr. Mafferton hovered, quoting Claudian on the mulberry tree,

upon the brink of a proposal, so I took him away to translate his

quotation for me in the stern, which naturally suggested the past and

its emotions. We could now refer quite sympathetically to the altogether

irretrievable and gone by, and Mr. Mafferton was able to mention Lady

Torquilan without any trace of his air that she was a person, poor dear,

that brought embarrassment with her. Indeed, I sometimes thought he

dragged her in. I asked him, in appropriate phrases, of course, whether

he had decided to accept Mrs. Portheris's daughter, and he fixed

mournful eyes upon me and said he thought he had, almost. The news of my

engagement to Mr. Dod had apparently done much to bring him to a

conclusion; he said it pointed so definitely to the unlikelihood of his

ever being able to find a more stimulating companion than Miss

Portheris, with all her charms, was likely to prove. It was difficult,

of course, to see the connection, but I could not help confiding to Mr.

Mafferton, as a secret, that there was hardly any chance of my union

with Dicky—after what poppa had said. When I assured him that I had no

intention whatever of disobeying my parent in a matter of which he was

so much better qualified to be a judge than I, it was impossible not to

see Mr. Mafferton's good opinion of me rising in his face. He said he

could not help sympathising with the paternal view, but that was all he

would say; he refrained magnificently from abusing Dicky. And we

parted mutually more deeply convinced than ever of the undesirability of

doing anything rash in the all important direction we had been

discussing.
As we disembarked at Colico to take the train for Chiavenna, Mrs.

Portheris, after seeing that Mr. Mafferton was collecting the

portmanteaux, gave me a word of comfort and of admonition. "Take my

advice, my child," she said, "and be faithful to poor dear Richard. Your

father must, in the end, give way. I shall keep at him in your

interests. When you left us this afternoon," continued the lady

mysteriously, "he immediately took out his fountain pen and wrote a

letter. It was directed—I saw that much—to a Mr. Arthur Page. Is he

the creature who is to be forced upon you, my child?" Mrs. Portheris in

the sentimental view was really affecting.
"I think it very likely," I said calmly, "but I have promised to be

faithful to Richard, Mrs. Portheris, and I will."
But I really felt a little nervous.

CHAPTER XXIII.
The instant we saw the diligence momma declared that if she had to sit

anywhere but in the middle of it she would remain in Chiavenna until

next day. Mrs. Portheris was of the same mind. She said that even the

intérieur would be dangerous enough going down hill, but if the

Senator would sit there too she would try not to be nervous. The coupé

was terrifying—one saw everything the poor dear horses did—and as to

the banquette she could imagine herself flying out of it, if we so

much as went over a stone. As a party we were strangers to the

diligence; we had all the curiosity and hesitation about it, as Dicky

remarked, of the animals when Noah introduced them to the Ark. I asked

Dicky to describe the diligence for the purpose of this volume, thinking

that it might, here and there, have a reader who had never seen one, and

he said that, as soon as he had made up his mind whether it was most

like a triumphal chariot in a circus procession or a boudoir car in an

ambulance, he would; but then his eyes wandered to Isabel, who was

pinker than ever in the mountain air, and his reasoning faculties left

him. A small German with a very red nose, most incoherent in his

apparel—he might have been a Baron or again a hair-dresser—already

occupied one of the seats in the intérieur, so after our elders had

been safely deposited beside him the banquette and the coupé were

left, as Mrs. Portheris said, to the adventurous young people. Dicky and

I had conspired, for the sustained effect on Mrs. Portheris, to sit in

the banquette, while Isabel was to suffer Mr. Mafferton in the

coupé—an arrangement which her mother viewed with entire complacency.

"After all," said Mrs. Portheris to momma, "we're not in Hyde Park—and

young people will be young people." We had not counted, however, with

the Senator, who suddenly realised, as Dicky was handing me up, that it

was his business, in the capacity of Doge, to interfere. It is to his

credit that he found it embarrassing, on account of his natural, almost

paternal, dislike to make things unpleasant for Dicky. He assumed a

sternly impenetrable expression, thought about it for a moment, and then

approached Mr. Mafferton.
"I'd be obliged to you," he said, "if you could arrange, without putting

yourself out any, to change places with young Dod, there, as far as St.

Moritz. I have my reasons—but not necessarily for publication. See?"
Mr. Mafferton's eye glistened with appreciation of the confidence

reposed in him. "I shall be most happy," he said, "if Dod doesn't mind."

But Dicky, with indecent haste, was already in the coupé. "Don't

mention it, Mafferton," he said out of the window. "I'm delighted—at

least—whatever the Senator says has got to be done, of course," and he

made an attempt to look hurt that would not have imposed upon anybody

but a self-constituted Doge with a guilty conscience. I took my

bereavement in stony calm, with possibly just a suggestion about my

eyebrows and under-lip that some day, on the far free shores of Lake

Michigan, a downtrodden daughter would re-assert herself; poppa

re-entered an intérieur darkened by a thunder-cloud on the brow of his

Aunt Caroline; and we started.
It was some time before Mr. Mafferton interfered in the least with the

Engadine. He seemed wrapped in a cloud of vain imaginings, sprung,

obviously, from poppa's ill-considered request. I understood his

emotions and carefully respected his silence. I was unwilling to be

instructed about the Engadine either botanically or geologically—it was

more agreeable not to know the names of the lovely little foreign

flowers, and quite pleasant enough that every turn in the road showed us

a white mountain or a purple one without having to understand what it

was made of. Besides, I particularly did not wish to precipitate

anything, and there are moments when a mere remark about the weather

will do it. I had been suffering a good deal from my conscience since

Mrs. Portheris had told me that poppa had written to Arthur—I didn't

mind him enduring unnumbered pangs of hope deferred, but it was quite

another thing that he should undergo the unnecessary martyrdom of

imagining that he had been superseded by Dicky Dod. On reflection, I

thought it would be safer to start Mr. Mafferton on the usual lines, and

I nerved myself to ask him whether he could tell me anything about the

prehistoric appearance of these lovely mountains.
"I am glad," he responded absently, "that you admire my favourite Alps."

Nothing more. I tried to prick him to the consideration of the scenery

by asking him which were his favourite Alps, but this also came to

nothing. Having acknowledged his approval of the Alps, he seemed willing

to let them go unadorned by either fact or fancy. I offered him

sandwiches, but he seemed to prefer his moustache. Presently he roused

himself.
"I'm afraid you must think me very uninteresting, Miss Wick," he said.
"Dear me, no," I replied. "On the contrary, I think you are a lovely

type."
"Type of an Englishman?" Mr. Mafferton was not displeased.
"Type of some Englishmen. You would not care to represent the—ah,

commercial classes?"
"If I had been born in that station," replied Mr. Mafferton modestly, "I

should be very glad to represent them. But I should not care to be a

Labour candidate."
"It wouldn't be very appropriate, would it?" I suggested. "But do you

ever mean to run for anything, really?"
"Certainly not," Mr. Mafferton replied, with slight resentment. "In our

family we never run. But, of course, I will succeed my uncle in the

Upper House."
"Dear me!" I exclaimed. "So you will! I should think it would be simply

lovely to be born a legislator. In our country it is attained by such

painful degrees." It flashed upon me in a moment why Mr. Mafferton was

so industrious in collecting general information. He was storing it up

against the day when he would be able to make speeches, which nobody

could interrupt, in the House of Lords.
The conversation flagged again, and I was driven to comment upon the

appearance of the little German down in the intérieur. It was quite

remarkable, apart from the bloom on his nose, his pale-blue eyes

wandered so irresponsibly in their sockets, and his scanty, flaxen beard

made such an unsuccessful effort to disguise the amiability of his chin.

He wore a braided cotton coat to keep cool, and a woollen comforter to

keep warm, and from time to time he smilingly invited the attention of

the other three to vast green maps of the country, which I could see him

apologising for spreading over Mrs. Portheris's capacious lap. It was

interesting to watch his joyous sense of being in foreign society, and

his determination to be agreeable even if he had to talk all the time.

Now and then a sentence bubbled up over the noise of the wheels, as when

he had the happiness to discover the nationalities of his

fellow-travellers.
"Ach, is it so? From England, from America also, and I from Markadorf

am! Four peoples, to see zis so beautiful Switzerland from everyveres in

one carriage we are come!" He smiled at them one after another in the

innocent joy of this wonderful fact, and it made me quite unhappy to see

how unresponsive they had grown.
"In America I haf one uncle got——"
"No, I don't know him," said the Senator, who was extremely tired of

being expected to keep up with society in Castle Garden.
"But before I vas born going, mein uncle I myself haf never seen! To

Chicago mit nossings he went, und now letters ve are always getting it

is goot saying."
"Made money, has he?" poppa inquired, with indifference.
"Mit some small flours of large manufacture selling. Dose small

flours—ze name forgotten I haf—ze breads making, ze cakes making, ze

mädschen——"
"Baking powder!" divined momma.
"Bakings—powder! In America it is moch eat. So mine uncle Blittens——"
"Josef Blittens?" exclaimed poppa.
"Blittens und Josef also! The name of mine uncle to you is known! He is

so rich, mit carriage, piano, large family—he is now famous also, hein?

My goot uncle!"
"He's been my foreman for fifteen years," said poppa, "and I don't care

where he came from; he's as good an American now as there is in the

Union. I am pleased to make the acquaintance of any member of his

family. There's nothing in the way of refreshments to be got till we

next change horses, but as soon as that happens, sir, I hope you will

take something."
After that we began to rattle down the other side of the Julier and I

lost the thread of the conversation, but I saw that Herr Blittens'

determination to practise English was completely swamped in the

Senator's desire to persuade him of the advantages of emigration.
"I never see a foreigner in his native land," said Mr. Mafferton,

regarding this one with disapproval, "without thinking what a pity it is

that any portion of the earth, so desirable for instance as this is,

should belong to him." Which led me to suggest that when he entered

political life in his native land Mr. Mafferton should aim at the

Cabinet, he was obviously so well qualified to sustain British

traditions.
My companion's mind seemed to be so completely diverted by this prospect

that I breathed again. He could be depended upon I knew, never to think

seriously of me when there was an opportunity of thinking seriously of

himself, and in that certainty I relaxed my efforts to make it quite

impossible that anything should happen. I forgot the contingencies of

the situation in finding whiter glaciers and deeper gorges, and looking

for the Bergamesque sheep and their shepherds which Baedeker assured us

were to be seen pasturing on the slopes and heights of the Julier

wearing long curling locks, mantles of brown wool, and peaked Calabrian

hats. We grew quite frivolous over this phenomenon, which did not

appear, and it was only after some time that we observed the Baedeker to

be of 1877, and decided that the home of truth was not in old editions.

It seemed to me afterwards that Mr. Mafferton had been waiting for his

opportunity; he certainly took advantage of a very insufficient one.
"It's exactly," said I, talking of the compartments of the diligence,

"as if Isabel and Dicky had the first floor front, momma and poppa the

dining room, and you and I the second floor back."
It was one of those things that one lives to repent if one survives them

five seconds; but my remorse was immediately swallowed up in

consequences. I do not propose to go into the details of Mr. Mafferton's

second attempt upon my insignificant hand—to be precise, I wear fives

and a quarter—but he began by saying that he thought we could do better

than that, meaning the second floor back, and he mentioned Park Lane. He

also said that ever since Dicky, doubtless before his affections had

become involved, had told him that there was a possibility of my

changing my mind—I was nearly false to Dicky at this point—he had been

giving the matter his best consideration, and he had finally decided

that it was only fair that I should have an opportunity of doing so.

These were not his exact words, but I can be quite sure of my

impression. We were trotting past the lake at Maloja when this came upon

me, and when I reflected that I owed it about equally to poppa and to

Dicky Dod I felt that I could have personally chastised them—could have

slapped them—both. What I longed to do with Mr. Mafferton was to hurl

him, figuratively speaking, down an abyss, but that would have been to

send him into Mrs. Portheris's beckoning arms next morning, and I had

little faith in any floral hat and pink bun once its mamma's commands

were laid upon it. I thought of my cradle companion—not tenderly, I

confess—and told Mr. Mafferton that I didn't know what I had done to

deserve such an honour a second time, and asked him if he had properly

considered the effect on Isabel. I added that I fancied Dicky was

generalising about American girls changing their minds, but I would try

and see if I had changed mine and would let him know in six days, at

Harwich. Any decision made on this side of the Channel might so easily

be upset. And this I did knowing quite well that Dicky and Isabel and I

were all to elope from Boulogne, Dicky and Isabel for frivolity and I

for propriety; for this had been arranged. In writing a description of

our English tour I do not wish to exculpate myself in any particular.
We arrived late at St. Moritz, and the little German, on a very

fraternal footing, was still talking as the party descended from the

intérieur. He spoke of the butterflies the day before in Pontresina,

and he laughed with delight as he recounted.
"Vorty maybe der vas, vifty der vas, mit der diligence vlying along; und

der brittiest of all I catch; he vill come at my nose"

CHAPTER XXIV.
Leaving out the scenery—the Senator declares that nothing

spoils a book of travels like scenery—the impressions of St. Moritz

which remain with me have something of the quality, for me, of the

illustrations in a French novel. I like to consult them; they are so

crisp and daintily defined and isolated and individual. Yet I can only

write about an upper class German mamma eating brodchen and honey with

three fair square daughters, young, younger, youngest, and not a flaxen

hair mislaid among them, and the intelligent accuracy with which they

looked out of the window and said that it was a horse, the horse was

lame, and it was a pity to drive a lame horse. Or about the two American

ladies from the south, creeping, wrapped up in sealskins, along the

still white road from the Hof to the Bad, and saying one to the other,

"Isn't it nice to feel the sun on yo' back?" Or about the curio shops on

the ridge where the politest little Frenchwomen endeavour to persuade

you that you have come to the very top of the Engadine for the purpose

of buying Japanese candlesticks and Italian scarves to carry down again.

It was all so clear and sharp and still at St. Moritz; everything drew

a double significance from its height and its loneliness. But, as poppa

says, a great deal of trouble would be saved if people who feel that

they can't describe things would be willing to consider the alternative

of leaving them alone; and I will only dwell on St. Moritz long enough

to say that it nearly shattered one of Mr. Mafferton's most cherished

principles. Never in his life before, he said, had he felt inclined to

take warm water in his bath in the morning. He made a note of the

temperature of his tub to send to the Times. "You never can tell," he

said, "the effect these little things may have." I was beginning to be

accustomed to the effect they had on me.
Before we got to Coire the cool rushing night had come and the glaciers

had blotted themselves out. I find a mere note against Coire to the

effect that it often rains when you arrive there, and also that it is a

place in which you may count on sleeping particularly sound if you come

by diligence; but there is no reason why I should not mention that it

was under the sway of the Dukes of Swabia until 1268, as momma wishes me

to do so. We took the train there for Constance, and between Coire and

Constance, on the Bodensee, occurred Rorshach and Romanshorn; but we

didn't get out, and, as momma says, there was nothing in the least

individual about their railway stations. We went on that Bodensee,

however, I remember with animosity, taking a small steamer at Constance

for Neuhausen. It was a gray and sulky Bodensee, full of little dull

waves and a cold head wind that never changed its mind for a moment.

Isabel and I huddled together for comfort on the very hard wooden seat

that ran round the deck, and the depth of our misery may be gathered

from the fact that, when the wind caught Isabel's floral hat under the

brim and cast it suddenly into that body of water, neither of us looked

round! Mrs. Portheris was very much annoyed at our unhappy indifference.

She implied that it was precisely to enable Isabel to stop a steamer on

the Bodensee in an emergency of this sort that she had had her taught

German. Dicky told me privately that if it had happened a week before he

would have gone overboard in pursuit, for the sake of business, without

hesitation, but, under the present happy circumstances, he preferred the

prospect of buying a new hat. Nothing else actually transpired during

the afternoon, though there were times when other events seemed as

precipitant, to most of us, as upon the tossing Atlantic, and we made

port without having realised anything about the Bodensee, except that we

would rather not be on it.
Neuhausen was the port, but Schaffhausen was of course the place, two or

three dusty miles along a river the identity of which revealed itself to

Mrs. Portheris through the hotel omnibus windows as an inspiration. "Do

we all fully understand," she demanded, "that we are looking upon the

Rhine?" And we endeavoured to do so, though the Senator said that if it

were not so intimately connected with the lake we had just been

delivered from he would have felt more cordial about it. I should like

to have it understood that relations were hardly what might be called

strained at this time between the Senator and myself. There were

subjects which we avoided, and we had enough regard for our dignity,

respectively, not to drop into personalities whatever we did, but we had

a modus vivendi, we got along. Dicky maintained a noble and pained

reserve, giving poppa hours of thought, out of which he emerged with the

almost visible reflection that a Wick never changed his mind.
There was a garden with funny little flowers in it which went out of

fashion in America about twenty years ago. There was also a châlet in

the garden, where we saw at once that we could buy cuckoo clocks and

edelweiss and German lace if we wanted to. There was a big hotel full of

people speaking strange languages—by this time we all sympathised with

Mr. Mafferton in his resentment of foreigners in Continental hotels; as

he said, one expected them to do their travelling in England. There were

the "Laufen" foaming down the valley under the dining room windows,

there were the Swiss waitresses in short petticoats and velvet bodices

and white chemisettes, and at the dinner table, sitting precisely

opposite, there were the Malts. Mr. Malt, Mrs. Malt, Emmeline Malt, and

Miss Callis, not one of them missing. The Malts whom we had left at

Rome, left in the same hotel with Count Filgiatti, and to some purpose

apparently, for seated attentively next to Mrs. Malt there also was

that diminutive nobleman.
As a family we saw at a glance that America was not likely to be the

poorer by one Count in spite of the way we had behaved to him. Miss

Callis, with four thousand dollars a year of her own, was going to offer

them up to sustain the traditions of her country. A Count, if she could

help it, should not go a-begging more than twice. Further impressions

were lost in the shock of greeting, but it recurred to me instantly to

wonder whether Miss Callis had really gone into the question of keeping

a Count on that income, whether she would be able to give him all the

luxuries he had been brought up in anticipation of. It was interesting

to observe the slight embarrassment with which Count Filgiatti

re-encountered his earlier American vision, and his re-assurance when I

gave him the bow of the most travelling of acquaintances. Nothing was

further from my thoughts than interfering. When I considered the number

of engagements upon my hands already, it made me quite faint to

contemplate even an arrangimento in addition to them.
We told the Malts where we had been and they told us where they had been

as well as we could across the table without seeming too confidential,

and after dinner Emmeline led the way to the enclosed verandah which

commanded the Falls. "Come along, ladies and gentlemen," said Emmeline,

"and see the great big old Schaffhausen Fraud. Performance begins at

nine o'clock exactly, and no reserve seats, so unless you want to get

left, Mrs. Portheris, you'd better put a hustle on."
Miss Malt had gone through several processes of annihilation at Mrs.

Portheris's hands, and had always come out of them so much livelier than

ever, that our Aunt Caroline had abandoned her to America some time

previously.
"Emmeline!" exclaimed Mrs. Malt, "you are too personal."
"She ought to be sent to the children's table," Mrs. Portheris remarked

severely.
"Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Portheris. I don't like milk puddings—they

give you a double chin. I expect you've eaten a lot of 'em in your time,

haven't you, Mis' Portheris? Now, Mr. Mafferton, you sit here, and you,

Mis' Wick, you sit here. That's right, Mr. Wick, you hold up the wall.

I ain't proud, I'll sit on the floor—there now, we're every one fixed.

No, Mr. Dod, none of us ladies object to smoking—Mis' Portheris smokes

herself, don't you, Mis' Portheris?"
"Emmeline, if you pass another remark to bed you go!" exclaimed her

mother with unction.
"I was fourteen the day before yesterday, and you don't send people of

fourteen to bed. I got a town lot for a birthday present. Oh, there's

the French gentleman! Bon soir, Monsieur! Comment va-t-il! Attendez!"

and we were suddenly bereft of Emmeline.
"She's gone to play poker with that man from Marseilles," remarked Mrs.

Malt. "Really, husband, I don't know——"
"You able to put a limit on the game?" asked poppa.
Everybody laughed, and Mr. Malt said that it wasn't possible for

Emmeline to play for money because she never could keep as much as five

francs in her possession, but if she did he'd think it necessary to

warn the man from Marseilles that Miss Malt knew the game.
"And she's perfectly right," continued her father, "in describing this

illumination business as a fraud. I don't say it isn't pretty enough,

but it's a fraud this way, they don't give you any choice about paying

your money for it. Now we didn't start boarding at this hotel, we went

to the one down there on the other side of the river. We were very much

fatigued when we arrived, and every member of our party went straight to

bed. Next day—I always call for my bills daily—what do I find in my

account but 'Illumination de la chute de la Rhin' one franc apiece."
"And you hadn't ordered anything of the kind," said poppa.
"Ordered it? I hadn't even seen it! Well, I didn't lose my temper. I

took the document down to the office and asked to have it explained to

me. The explanation was that it cost the hotel a large sum of money. I

said I guessed it did, and it was also probably expensive to get hot and

cold water laid on, but I didn't see any mention of that in the bill,

though I used the hot and cold water, and didn't use the illumination."
"That's so," said poppa.
"Well, then the fellow said it was done all on my account, or words to

that effect, and that it was a beautiful illumination and worth twice

the money, and as it was the rule of the hotel he'd have to trouble me

for the price of it."
"Did you oblige him?" asked poppa.
"Yes, I did. I hated to awfully, but you never can tell where the law

will land you in a foreign country, especially when you can't converse

with the judge, and I don't expect any stranger could get justice in

Schaffhausen against an hotel anyway. But I sent for my party's trunks,

and we moved—down there to that little thing like a castle overhanging

the Falls. It was a castle once, I believe, but it's a deception now,

for they've turned it into an hotel."
"Find it comfortable there?" inquired the Senator.
"Well, I'm telling you. Pretty comfortable. You could sit in the garden

and get as wet as you liked from the spray, and no extra charge; and if

you wanted to eat apricots at the same time they only cost you a franc

apiece. So when I saw how moderate they were every way, I didn't think

I'd have any trouble about the illumination, specially as I heard that

the three hotels which compose Schaffhausen subscribed to run the

electric plant, and I'd already helped one hotel with its subscription."
"When did you move in here?" asked poppa.
"I am coming to that. Well, I saw the show that night. I happened to be

on an outside balcony when it came off, and I couldn't help seeing it. I

wouldn't let myself out so far as to enjoy it, for fear it might

prejudice me later, but I certainly looked on. You can't keep your eyes

shut for three-quarters of an hour for the sake of a principle valued at

a franc a head."
"I expect you had to pay," said poppa.
"You're so impatient. I looked coldly on, and between the different

coloured acts I made a calculation of the amount the hotel opposite was

losing by its extortion. I took considerable satisfaction in doing it.

You can get excited over a little thing like that just as much as if it

were the entire Monroe Doctrine; and I couldn't sleep, hardly, that

night for thinking of the things I'd say to the hotel clerk if the

illumination item decorated the bill next day. Cut myself shaving in the

morning over it—thing I never do. Well, there it was—'Illumination de

la chute de la Rhin,' same old French story, a franc apiece."
"I thought, somehow, from what you've been saying, that it would be

there," remarked the Senator patiently.
"Well, sir, I tried to control myself, but I guess the clerk would tell

you I was pretty wild. There wasn't an argument I didn't use. I threw as

many lights on the situation as they did on the Falls. I asked him how

it would be if a person preferred his Falls plain? I told him I paid

him board and lodging for what Schaffhausen could show me, not for what

I could show Schaffhausen. I used the words 'pillage,' 'outrage,' and

other unmistakable terms, and I spoke of communicating the matter to the

American Consul at Berne."
"And after that?" inquired the Senator.
"Oh, it wasn't any use. After that I paid, and moved. Moved right up

here, this morning. But I thought about it a good deal on the way, and

concluded that, if I wasn't prepared to sample every hotel within ten

miles of this cataract for the sake of not being imposed upon, I'd have

to take up a different attitude. So I walked up to the manager the

minute we arrived, fierce as an Englishman—beg your pardon, Squire

Mafferton, but the British have a ferocious way with hotel managers,

as a rule. I didn't mean anything personal—and said to him exactly as

if it was my hotel, and he was merely stopping in it, 'Sir,' I said, 'I

understand that the guests of this hotel are allowed to subscribe to an

electric illumination of the Falls of the Rhine. You may put me down for

ten francs. Now I'm prepared, for the first time, to appreciate the

evening's entertainment."
Shortly after the recital of Mr. Malt's experiences the illumination

began, and we realised what it was to drink coffee in fairyland. Poppa

advises me, however, to attempt no description of the Falls of

Schaffhausen by any light, because "there," he says, "you will come into

competition with Ruskin." The Senator is perfectly satisfied with

Ruskin's description of the Falls; he says he doesn't believe much could

be added to it. Though he himself was somewhat depressed by them, he

found that he liked them so much better than Niagara. I heard him myself

tell five different Alpine climbers, in precise figures, how much more

water went over our own cataract.
It was discovered that evening that Mr. and Mrs. Malt, and Emmeline, and

Miss Callis and the Count were going on to Heidelberg and down the Rhine

by precisely the same train and steamer that we had ourselves selected.

Mrs. Malt was looking forward to the ruins on the embattled Rhine with

all the enthusiasm we had expended upon Venice, but Mr. Malt declared

himself so full of the picturesque already that he didn't know how he

was going to hold another castle.

CHAPTER XXV.
We were on our way from Basle to Heidelberg, I remember, and

Mr. Malt was commenting sarcastically upon Swiss resources for naming

towns as exemplified in "Neuhausen." "There's a lot about this country,"

said Mr. Malt, "that reminds you of the world as it appeared about the

time you built it for yourself every day with blocks, and made it lively

with animals out of your Noah's Ark. I can't say what it is, but that's

a sample of it—'New Houses!' What a baby baa-lamb name for a town! It

would settle the municipality in our part of the world—any railway

would make a circuit of fifty miles to avoid it!"
Mr. Mafferton and I had paused in our conversation, and these remarks

reached us in full. They gave him the opportunity of bending a

sympathetic glance upon me and saying, "How graphic your countrymen are,

Miss Wick." Cologne was only three days off, but Mr. Mafferton never

departed from the proprieties in his form of address. He was in that

respect quite the most docile and respectful person I have ever found it

necessary to keep in suspense.
I said they were not all as pictorial as Mr. Malt, and noticed that his

eye was wandering. It had wandered to Miss Callis, who was snubbing the

Count, and looking wonderfully well. I don't know whether I have

mentioned that she had blue eyes and black hair, but her occupation, of

course, would be becoming to anybody.
"And for the matter of that your country-women, too," said Mr.

Mafferton. "I am much gratified to have the opportunity of making the

acquaintance of another of them in this unexpected way. I find your

friend, Miss Callis, a charming creature."
She wasn't my friend, but the moment did not seem opportune for saying

so.
"I saw you talking a good deal to her yesterday," I said.
Mr. Mafferton twisted his moustache with a look of guilty satisfaction

which I found hard to bear. "Must I cry Peccavi?" he said. "You see

you were so—er—preoccupied. You said you would rather hear about the

growth of the Swiss Confederacy and its relation to the Helvetia of the

Ancients another day."
"That was quite true," I said indignantly.
"I found Miss Callis anxious to be informed without delay," said Mr.

Mafferton, with a slightly rebuking accent. "She has a very open mind,"

he went on musingly.
"Oh, wonderfully," I said.
"And a highly retentive memory. It seems she was shown over our place in

Surrey last summer. She described it to me in the most perfect detail.

She must be very observant."
"She's as observant as ever she can be," I remarked. "I expect she could

describe you in the most perfect detail too, if she tried." I sweetened

this with an exterior smile, but I felt extremely rude inside.
"Oh, I fear I could not flatter myself—but how interesting that would

be! One has always had a desire to know the impression one makes as a

whole, so to speak, upon a fresh and unsophisticated young intelligence

like that."
"Well," I said, "there isn't any reason why you shouldn't find out at

once." For the Count had melted away, and Miss Callis was not nearly so

much occupied with her novel as she appeared to be.
Mr. Mafferton rose, and again stroked his moustache, with a quizzical

disciplinary air.

"Oh woman, in your hours of ease
Uncertain, coy, and hard to please!"

He quoted. "You are a very whimsical young lady, but since you send me

away I must abandon you."
"Thanks so much!" I said. "I mean—I have myself to blame, I know," and

as Mr. Mafferton dropped into the seat opposite Miss Callis I saw Mrs.

Portheris regard him austerely, as one for whom it was possible to make

too much allowance.
In connection with Heidelberg I wish there were something authentic to

say about Perkeo; but nobody would believe the quantity of wine he is

supposed to have drunk in a day, which is the statement oftenest made

about him, so it is of no consequence that I have forgotten the number

of bottles. He isn't the patron saint of Heidelberg, because he only

lived about a hundred and fifty years ago, and the first qualification

for a patron saint is antiquity. As poppa says, there may be elderly

gentlemen in Heidelberg now whose grandfathers have warned them against

the personal habits of Perkeo from actual observation. Also we know that

he was a court jester, and the pages of the Calendar, for some reason,

are closed to persons in that walk of life. Judging by the evidences of

his popularity that survive on all sides, Mr. Malt declared that he was

probably worth more to the town in attracting residents and investors

than half-a-dozen patron saints, and in this there may have been more

truth than reverence. The Elector Charles Philip, whose court he jested

for, certainly made no such mark upon his town and time as Perkeo did,

and in that, perhaps, there is a moral for sovereigns, although the

Senator advises me not to dwell upon it. At all events, one writes of

Heidelberg but one thinks of Perkeo, as he swings from the sign-boards

of the Haupt-Strasse, and stands on the lids of the beer mugs, and

smiles from the extra-mural decoration of the wine shops, and lifts his

glass, in eternally good wooden fellowship, beside the big Tun in the

Castle cellar. There is a Hotel Perkeo, there must be Clubs Perkeo,

probably a suburb and steamboats of the same name, and the local oath

"Per Perkeo!" has a harmless sound, but nothing could be more binding

in Heidelberg. Momma thought his example a very unfortunate one for a

University town, but the rest of us were inclined to admire Perkeo as a

self-made man and a success. As Dicky protested he had made the fullest

use of the capacities Nature had given him, it was evident from his

figure that he had even developed them, and what more profitable course

should the German youth follow? He was cheerful everywhere—as the

forerunner of the comic paper one supposes he had to be—but most

impressive in his effigy by his master's wine vat, in the perpetual

aroma that most inspired him, where, by a mechanical arrangement inside

him, he still makes a joke of sorts, in somewhat graceless aspersion of

the methods of the professional humorists. Emmeline found him very like

her father, and confided her impression to Mrs. Malt. "But of course,"

she added condoningly, "poppa was different when you married him."
Perkeo was not so sentimental as the Trumpeter of Sakkingen, and the

Trumpeter of Sakkingen was not so sentimental as the Heidelberg

University student. The Heidelberg University student was as a rule very

round and very young, and he seemed to give up the whole of his spare

time to imitating the passion which I hope has not been permitted to

enter too largely into this book of travels.
Dicky and I agreed that it was a mere imitation; that is, Dicky said it

was and I agreed. It could not possibly amount to anything more, for it

consisted wholly in walking up and down in front of the house in which

its object lived. We saw it being done, and it looked so uninteresting

that we failed to realise what it meant until we inquired. Mrs.

Portheris's nephew, Mr. Jarvis Portheris, who was acquiring German in

Heidelberg, told us about it. Mrs. Portheris's nephew was just fourteen

and small of his age, but he, too, had selected the lady of his

admiration, and was taking regular daily pedestrian exercise in front of

her residence. He pointed out the residence, and observed with an

enormous frown that "another man" had usurped the pavement in his

absence, and was doing it in quick step doubtless to show his ardour.

"He's a beastly German too," said Mrs. Portheris's nephew, "so I can't

challenge him, but I'll jolly well punch his head."
"Come on," said Dicky, "you'd better steady your nerves," and treated

him liberally to ginger-beer and currant buns; but we were not allowed

to see the encounter, which Mr. Jarvis Portheris, gratefully satiate,

assured us must be conducted on strict lines of etiquette, with formal

preliminaries. He was so very young, and obviously knew so little about

what he was doing, that we questioned him with some delicacy, but we

discovered that the practice had no parallel, as Dicky put it, for lack

of incident. It was accompanied in some cases by the writing of poetry,

"German poetry, of course," said Mrs. Portheris's nephew ineffably, but

even that was more likely to be exhibited as evidence of the writer's

fervid state of mind than to be sent to its object, who plaited her

hair and attended to her domestic duties as if nobody were in the street

but the fishmonger. In Mr. Jarvis Portheris's case he did not know the

colour of her eyes, or the number of her years; he had selected her, it

seemed, at a venture, in church, from a rear view, sitting; and had

never seen her since. Dicky, whose predilections of this sort have

always been very active, asked him seriously why he adhered to such a

hollow mockery, and he said regretfully that a fellow more or less had

to; it was one of the beastly nuisances of being educated abroad. But

from what we saw of the German temperament generally we were convinced

that as a native demonstration it was sincere, and that its idiocy arose

only, as Dicky expressed it, from the remarkable lack in foreigners of

business capacity.
We all congratulated ourselves on seeing Heidelberg while the University

was in session, and we could observe the large fat students in flat blue

and pink and green club caps, swaggering about the town accompanied by

dogs of almost equal importance. The largest and fattest, I thought,

wore white caps, and, though Mr. Jarvis Portheris said that white was

the most aristocratic club's colour, they looked remarkably like bakers.

The Senator had an object in Heidelberg, as he had in so many places,

and that object was to investigate the practice of duelling, which

everybody understands to prevail to a deadly extent among the students.

It was plain from their appearance that personal assault at all events

was regrettably common, for nearly everyone of them wore traces of it

in their faces, wore them as if they were particularly becoming. Every

variety of scar that could well be imagined was represented, some

healed, some healing, and some freshly gory. The youth with the most

scars, we observed, gave himself the most airs, and the really

vainglorious were, more or less, obscured in cotton-wool, evidently just

from the hands of the surgeon. The Senator examined them individually as

they passed, with an inquisitiveness which they plainly enjoyed, and was

much impressed with their fighting qualities as a race, until Mr. Jarvis

Portheris happened to explain that the scars were very carefully given

and received with an almost exclusive view to personal adornment. Mr.

Mafferton appeared to have known this before; but that was an irritating

way he had—none of the rest of us did. The Senator regarded the next

youth he met, who had elongated his mouth to run up into his ear without

adding in the least to his charms of appearance, with barely disguised

contempt, and when Mr. Jarvis Portheris proceeded to explain how the

doctors pulled open the cuts if they promised to heal without leaving

any sign of valour, poppa's impatience with the noble army of duellists

grew so great that he could hardly remain in Heidelberg till the train

was ready to take him away.
"But don't they ever by accident do themselves any harm?" inquired my

disappointed parent.
"There's one case on record," said Mr. Jarvis Portheris, "and everybody

here says it's true. One fellow that was fighting happened to have a

dog, and the dog was allowed in. Well, the other fellow, by accident,

sliced off the end of the fellow that had the dog's nose—I don't mean

the dog's nose, you know, but the fellow's. That was going a bit far,

you know; they don't generally go so far. Well, the doctor said that

would be all right, they could easily make it grow on again; but when

they looked for the nose—the dog had eaten it! They never allow dogs

in now."
It was a simple little story, and it bore marks of unmistakable age and

many aliases, but it did much to reconcile the Senator to the University

student of Heidelberg, and especially to his dog.

CHAPTER XXVI.
Emmeline had childlike lapses; she rejoiced greatly, for instance, at

seeing a Strasbourg stork. She confessed, when she saw it, to having

read Hans Andersen when she was a little girl, and was happy in the

resemblance of the tall chimneys he stood on, and the high-pitched red

roofs he surveyed, to the pictures she remembered. But, for that matter,

so were we all. We had an hour and a half at Strasbourg, and we drove,

of course, to the Cathedral; but it was the stork that we saw, and that

each of us privately considered the really valuable impression. He stood

beside his nest with his chin sunk in his neck, looking immensely lucky

and wise, and one quite agreed with Emmeline that it must be lovely to

live under him.
We lunched at the station, and, as the meal progressed, saw again how

widespread and sincere is the German sentiment to which I alluded,

perhaps too lightly, in the last chapter. Our waitresses were all that

could be desired, until there came between us and them a youth from

parts without. He was sallow, and the waitresses were buxom; he might

have been a student of law or medicine, they were naturally of much

lower degree. But they frankly forsook us and sat down beside him in

terms of devotion and an open aspect of radiant happiness. When one went

to draw his lager beer he put an unrepelled arm round the waist of the

other, and when the first came back he chucked her under the chin with

undisguised affection, the while we looked on and starved, none knowing

the language except Isabel, who thought of nothing but blushing. As Mr.

Malt said, if the young man could only have made up his mind, we might

have been able to get along with the rejected one; but, apparently, he

was not in the least embarrassed by numbers, sending a large and

beguiling smile to yet a further hand-maiden, who passed enviously

through the speise-salle with a basin of soup. It was only when Dicky

stalked across to the old woman who sold sausages and biscuits behind a

counter, and pointed indignantly to the person who held all the

available table service of the Strasbourg railway station on his knees,

that we obtained redress. The old woman laughed as if it were amusing,

and called the maidens shrilly; but even then they came with reluctance,

as if we had been mere schnapps instead of ten complete luncheons, one

soup, and a bread and cheese, as Dicky said. The bread and cheese was

the Count, and one gathered from it that the improvement in his

immediate prospects was not yet assured, that the arrangimento was still

in futuro.
We had become such a large party, that it is impossible to relate the

whole of our experiences even in the half hour during which we dawdled

round the Strasbourg waiting-room until the train should start. I know

it was then, for instance, that Mrs. Portheris took Dicky aside and told

him how deeply she sympathised with him in his trying position, and bade

him only be faithful to the dictates of his own heart and all would come

right in time. I know Dicky promised faithfully to do so, but I must not

dwell upon it. Nor is the opportunity adequate to express the

indignation we all felt, and not Mr. Mafferton merely, at the

insufficient personal impression we made upon the German railway

officials. They were so completely preoccupied with their magnificent

selves and their vast business that they were unable even to look at us

when we asked them questions, and their sole conception of a reply was

an order, in terms that sounded brutal to a degree. They were

objectionably burly and red in the face; they wore an offensive number

of buttons and straps upon their uniforms. As Mr. Mafferton said, they

utterly misconceived their position in life, attempting to Kaiser the

travelling public by Divine right instead of recognising themselves as

humble servants, buttoned only to be made more agreeable to the eye.
One such person trampled upon us to such an extent that I have never

been able to satisfy myself that the Senator was sincere in making his

little mistake. We were sitting in dejected rows, with a number of other

foreigners who had been similarly reduced, when this official entered

the waiting-room, advanced to the middle of it, posed with great

majesty, and emitted several bars of a kind of chant or chime. It was

delivered with too much vigour, and it stopped too abruptly, to be

entirely enjoyable; but there was no doubt about the musical intention.

It was not even intoning; it was singing, beginning with moderation,

going on stronger with indignation, and ending suddenly in a crescendo

of denunciation.
We smiled in difficult self-restraint as he went away, and Dicky

remarked that he supposed we were in their hands, we couldn't object to

anything they did to us. In five minutes he came back to exactly the

same spot and sang again the same words, in the same key, with the same

unction. "Encore!" exclaimed Mr. Malt boldly, but cowered under the

glare that was turned upon him, and utterly fell away when we reminded

him of the punishments attached in Germany to the charge of lèse

majesté. Precisely five minutes more passed away, and Bawlinbuttons, as

Miss Callis called him, entered again. Then occurred the Senator's

little mistake. In the midst of the second bar, the indignant one,

Bawlinbuttons stopped short, petrified by poppa, who had advanced and

was holding out copper coins whose usefulness we had left behind us, to

the value of about fifteen cents.
"Here's the collection," said poppa benevolently—for an instant or two

he was quite audible—"but unless you know some other tune the company

wish me to say that they won't trouble you any further."
There are misunderstandings that are never rectified, sometimes because

a train draws up at the platform as in this case, and sometimes for

other reasons, and it was natural enough that poppa should fail to

comprehend Bawlinbuttons' indignant shouts to the effect that a Kaiser

should never be mistaken for an organ-grinder, merely because his tastes

are musical. Neither is it likely that the various Teutons who were

waiting for the information will ever understand why the announcement

that the train for Saarburg, Nancy, Frankfort, and Mayence would leave

at ten o'clock precisely was never completed for the third time,

according to the regulation. But we have often wondered since what

Bawlinbuttons did with the coppers.
We divided up on the way to Mayence, and Mr. and Mrs. Malt came into

the compartment with the Senator, momma, and me. Mr. Malt was

unsatisfied with poppa's revenge on Bawlinbuttons, and proposed to make

things awkward further for the guard. He said it could be done very

simply, by a disagreement between himself and the Senator as to whether

the windows should be open or shut. He said he had heard of a German

guard put to the most enjoyable misery by such a dispute, not knowing

the language of the disputants and being forced to arbitrate upon their

respective demands. Mr. Malt had laughed at the Senator's joke, so the

Senator, of course, had to assist at Mr. Malt's, and they began to work

themselves up, as Mr. Malt said, into the spirit of it. Mr. Malt was to

insist that the windows should be shut, he said he had got a trifling

cold, and the Senator was to require them open in the interests of

ventilation. They rehearsed their arguments, and momma putting her head

out of the window at the first small station cried, "Be quick and change

your expressions—he's coming!"
In the presence of the guard Mr. Malt rose with dignity and closed the

windows. The Senator, with a well-simulated scowl, at once opened them

both.
"Stranger!" said Mr. Malt, while momma fumbled for her ticket, "I shut

those windows."
"Sir," responded poppa, "if you had not done so I shouldn't have been

obliged to open them."
"I can't die of pneumonia, sir," said Mr. Malt, again closing the

window, "to oblige you."
"Nor do I feel compelled," returned the Senator furiously, "to

asphyxiate my family to make it comfortable for you!" and the window

fell with a bang.
The guard, holding out a massive hand for my ticket, took no notice

whatever.
"Put it up again," said Mrs. Malt, who was more anxious than any of us

to avenge herself upon the German railway system, "and try to break the

glass."
"Attract his attention, Alexander," said momma. "Pull one of his silly

buttons off."
The guard gave no sign—he was replacing the elastic round my book of

coupons after detaching the green one on which was printed, "Strasburg

nach Mainz."
Poppa and Mr. Malt were sitting opposite each other in the middle of

the carriage.
"I tell you I've got bronchial trouble, and I won't be manslaughtered,"

cried Mr. Malt, hurling himself upon the strap, while poppa seized the

guard by the arm and pointed to the closed window. The only foreign

language with which poppa is acquainted is that used by the Indians on

the banks of the Saguenay river, a few words of which he acquired while

salmon fishing there two years ago. These he poured forth upon the

guard—they were the only ones that occurred to him, he said—at the

same time threatening with his disengaged fist bodily assault upon Mr.

Malt.
"That ought to draw him," said Mrs. Malt.
It did draw him.
"Leave go!" he said to poppa, and his air of authority was such that

poppa left go. "Is this here a lunatic party, or a young menagerie, or

what? Now look here," he continued, taking Mr. Malt by the elbow and

seating him with some violence in a corner seat and shutting the window.

"If you've got eight tickets for yourself say so, if you haven't that's

as much an' more than you are entitled to. The other gentleman——" But

the Senator had already collapsed into the furthest corner and was

looking fixedly through the closed glass. "Well, all I've got to say

is," he went on, lowering that window with decision, "that you can't go

kickin' up rows in this country same as you do at home, an' if you can't

get along more satisfactory together I'll——" here something interrupted

him, requiring to be transferred from the Senator's hand to the nearest

convenient pocket. "As I was goin' to say, gentlemen, there isn't any what

you might call strict rule about the windows, an' as far as I'm concerned,

you can settle it for yourselves."
Whereupon he swung along to the next carriage, the train having started,

and left us to reflect on the incongruity of an English railway guard in

Germany.
It was curious, but the incident left behind it a certain coolness, so

well defined that when momma suggested that the Malts' window should be

lowered as it was before to give us a current of air, Mrs. Malt said she

thought it would be better to abide by the decision of the guard, now

that we had referred it to him, and momma said, "Oh dear me, yes," if

she preferred to do so, and everybody established the most aggressively

private relations with books and newspapers. It was quite a relief when

Mrs. Portheris came at the next station to inquire whether, if we had no

married Germans in our compartment, we could possibly make room for

Isabel. Mrs. Portheris had married Germans in her compartment, two pairs

of them, and she could no longer permit her daughter to observe their

behaviour. "They obtrude their domestic relations," said Mrs. Portheris,

"in the most disgusting way. They are continually patting each other.

Quite middle-aged, too! And calling each other 'Leibchen,' and other

things which may be worse. My poor Isabel is dreadfully embarrassed,

for, of course, she can't always look out of the window. And as she

understands the language, I can't possibly tell what she may

overhear!"
We made room for Isabel, but the train to Mayence was crowded that day,

and before we arrived we had ample reason to believe that conjugal

affection is not only at home but abroad in Germany. The Senator, at one

point, threatened to travel on the engine to avoid it. He used, I think

the language of exaggeration about it. He said it was the most

objectionable article made in Germany. But I did not notice that Isabel

devoted herself at all seriously to looking out of the window.

CHAPTER XXVII.
"He tells me," said Miss Callis, "that you are to give him his answer at

Cologne."
"Does he, indeed?" said I. We were floating down the Rhine in the

society of our friends, two hundred and fifty other floaters, and a

string band. We had left the battlements of Bingen, and the Mouse Tower

was in sight. As we had already acquired the legend, and were sitting

behind the smoke stack, there was no reason why we should not discuss

Mr. Mafferton.
"I suppose he does not, by any chance, mention an alternative lady," I

said carelessly.
"I don't know," said Miss Callis, "that I should be disposed to listen

to him if he did. He would have to put it in some other light."
"Why should you object?" I asked. "Isabel is quite a proper person to

marry him. Much more so, I often think, than I."
"Oh!" said Miss Callis without meaning to. "I think he has outgrown that

taste. In fact, he told me so."
"He is for ever seeking a fresh bosom for a confidence!" I cried.
Miss Callis looked at me with more interest than she would have wished

to express.
"What do you really think of him?" she asked. "I sometimes feel as if I

had known you for years," and she took my hand.
I gave hers a gentle pressure, and edged a little nearer. "He has good

shoulders," I remarked critically.
"You would hardly marry him for his shoulders!"
"It doesn't seem quite enough," I admitted, "but then—his information

is always so accurate."
"If you think you would like living with an encyclopedia." Miss Callis

had begun to look embarrassed by my hand, but I still permitted it to

nestle confidingly in hers.
"He pronounces all his g's," I said, "and—did you ever see him in a

silk hat?"
"I don't think you are really attached to him, dear." (The "dear" was a

really creditable sacrifice to the situation.)
"I sometimes think," I murmured, "that one never knows one's own heart

until some sudden circumstance puts it to the test. Now if I had a

rival—in you, for instance—and I suddenly saw myself losing—but, of

course, that is impossible so far as you are concerned. Because of the

Count."
"The Count isn't in it," said Miss Callis firmly. "At least at present."
"But," I protested, "somebody must provide for him! I was so happy in

the thought that you had undertaken it."
Miss Callis gave me back my hand. She looked as if she would have liked

to throw it overboard.
"As you say," she said, "it is a little difficult to make up one's mind.

Don't you think those rocks to the right may be the Lorelei? I must go

and tell Mrs. Malt. She won't be fit to travel with for a week if she

misses the Lorelei." And Miss Callis left me to reflect upon the

inconsistencies of my sex.
"Do you realise," said Dicky, as, with an assumed air of nonchalance, he

sauntered up and took her chair, "that we shall be in Cologne in five

hours?"
"Fateful Cologne," I said. "There are Roman remains, I believe, as well

as the Cathedral and the scent. Also a Museum of Industrial Art, but

we'll skip that."
"We'll skip all of it," replied Mr. Dod, with determination, "you and I

and Isabel. The train for Paris leaves at nine precisely."
"Haven't you made up your minds to let me off," I pleaded. "I am sure

you would be happier alone. It's so unusual to elope with two ladies."
"You don't seem to realise how Isabel has been brought up," Dicky

returned patiently. "She can't travel alone with me, don't you see,

until we are married. Afterwards she'll chaperone you back to your party

again. So it will be all right for you, don't you see?"
I was obliged to say I saw, and we arranged the details. We would reach

Cologne about six, and Isabel and I, who would share a room as usual,

were secretly to pack one bag between us, which Dicky would smuggle out

of the hotel and send to the station. Isabel was to be fatigued and dine

in her room; I was to leave the table d'hôte early to solace her,

Dicky was to dine at a café and meet us at the station. We would put

out the lights and lock the door of the apartment on our departure, and

the chambermaid with hot water in the morning would be the first to

discover our flight. We only regretted that we could not be there to see

the astonishment of the chambermaid. "I won't fail you," I assured Mr.

Dod, "but what about Isabel? Isabel is essential; in fact, I won't

consent to this elopement without her."
"Isabel," said Dicky dubiously, "is all right, so far as her intentions

go. But she'd be the better for a little stiffening. Would you mind——"
I groaned in spirit, but went in search of Isabel, thinking of phrases

that might stiffen her. I found her looking undecided, with a pencil and

a slip of paper.
"How lucky you are," I said diplomatically, sinking into the nearest

chair, "to be going to wind up your trip on the Continent in such a

delightful way. It will be—ah—something to remember all your life."
"Oh, I suppose so," said Isabel plaintively, "but I should so much

prefer to be done in church. If mamma would only consent!"
"She never would," I declared, for I felt that I must see Isabel Mrs.

Dod within the next day or two at all costs.
"A registry office sounds so uninteresting. I suppose one just goes—as

one is."
"I don't think veils and trains are worn," I observed, "except by

persons of high rank who do not approve of the marriage service. I don't

know what the Marquis of Queensberry might do, or Mr. Grant Allen."
"Of course, the ceremony doesn't matter to them," replied Isabel

intelligently, "because they would just wear morning dress anywhere."
"Looking at it that way, they haven't much to lose," I conceded.
"And no wedding cake," grieved Isabel, "and no reception at the house of

the bride's mother. And you can't have your picture in the Queen."
"There would be a difficulty," I said, "about the descriptive part."
"And no favours for the coachman, and no trousseau——"
"I wonder," I said, "whether, under those circumstances, it's really

worth while."
"Oh, well!" said Isabel.
"It's a night to Paris, and a morning to Dover," I said. "We will wait

for the others at Dover—I fancy they'll hurry—that'll be another day.

I'll take one robe de nuit, Isabel, three pocket handkerchiefs, one

brush and comb, and tooth brush. You shall have all the rest of the

bag."
"You are a perfect love," exclaimed Miss Portheris, with the most

touching gratitude.
"We will share the soap," I continued, "until you are married.

Afterwards——"
"Oh, you can have it then," said Isabel, "of course," and she looked at

the Castle of Rheinfels and blushed beautifully.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
"There was only one thing that disappointed me," Mrs. Malt was saying at

the dinner table of the Cologne hotel, "and that wasn't so much what you

would call a disappointment as a surprise. White windows-blinds in a

robber castle on the Rhine I did not expect to see."
I slipped away before momma had time to announce and explain her

disappointments, but I heard her begin. Then I felt safe, for criticism

of the Rhine is absorbing matter for conversation. The steamer's custom

of giving one stewed plums with chicken is an affront to civilisation to

last a good twenty minutes by myself. I tried to occupy and calm

Isabel's mind with it as we walked over to the station, under the twin

towers of the Cathedral, but with indifferent success. To add to her

agitation at this crisis of her life, the top button came off her glove,

and when that happened I felt the inutility of words.
We passed the policemen on the Cathedral square with affected

indifference. We believed we were not liable to arrest, but policemen,

when one is eloping, have a forbidding look. We refrained, by mutual

arrangement, from turning once to look back for possible pursuers, but

that is not a thing I would undertake to do again under similar

circumstances. We even had the hardihood to buy a box of chocolates on

the way, that is, Isabel bought them, while I watched current events at

the confectioner's door. The station was really only about seven

minutes' walk from the hotel, but it seemed an hour before I was able to

point out Dicky, alert and expectant, on the edge of the platform behind

the line of cabs.
"So near the fulfilment of his hopes, poor fellow," I remarked.
"Yes," concurred Isabel, "but do you know I almost wish he wasn't

coming."
"Don't tell him so, whatever you do," I exclaimed. "I know Dicky's

sensitive nature, and it is just as likely as not that he would take you

at your word. And I will not elope with you alone."
I need not have been alarmed. Isabel had no intention of reducing the

party at the last moment. I listened for protests and hesitations when

they met, but all I heard was, "Have you got the bag?"
Dicky had the bag, the tickets, the places, everything. He had already

assumed, though only a husband of to-morrow, the imperative and

responsible connection with Isabel's arrangements. He told her she was

to sleep with her head toward the engine, that she was to drink nothing

but soda-water at any of the stations, and that she must not, on any

account, leave the carriage when we changed for Paris until he came for

her. It would be my business to see that these instructions were

carried out.
"What shall I do," I asked, "if she cries in the night?"
But Dicky was sweeping us toward the waiting-room, and did not hear me.

He placed us carefully in the seats nearest the main door, which opened

upon the departure platform, full of people hurrying to and fro, and of

the more leisurely movement of shunting trains. The lamps were lighted,

though twilight still hung about; the scene was pleasantly exciting. I

said to Isabel that I never thought I should enjoy an elopement so much.
"I shall enjoy settling down," she replied thoughtfully. "Dicky has

promised me that all the china shall be hand-painted."
"You won't mind my leaving you for five seconds," said Mr. Dod, suddenly

exploring his breast-pocket; "the train doesn't leave for a quarter of

an hour yet, and I find I haven't a smoke about me," and he opened the

door.
"Not more that five seconds then," I said, for nothing is more trying to

the nerves than to wait for a train which is due in a few minutes and a

man who is buying cigars at the same time.
Dicky left the door open, and that was how I heard a strangely familiar

voice, with an inflexion of enforced calm and repression, suddenly

address him from behind it.
"Good evening, Dod!"
I did not shriek, or even grasp Isabel's hand. I simply got up and

stood a little nearer the door. But I have known few moments so

electrical.
"My dear chap, how are you?" exclaimed Dicky. "How are you? Staying in

Cologne? I'm just off to Paris."
I thought I heard a heavy sigh, but it was somewhat lost in the

trundling of the porters' trucks.
"Then," said Arthur Page, for I had not been deceived, "it is as I

supposed."
"What did you suppose, old chap?" asked Dicky in a joyous and expansive

tone.
"You do not go alone?"
The bitterness of this was not a thing that could be communicated to

paper and ink.
"Why, no," said Dicky, "the fact is——"
I saw the wave—it was characteristic—with which Mr. Page stopped him.

"I have been made acquainted with the facts," he said. "Do not dwell

upon them. I do not, cannot, blame you, if you have really won her

heart."
"So far as I know," said Dicky, with some hauteur, "there's nothing in

it to give you the hump."
"Why waste time in idle words?" replied Arthur. "You will lose your

train. I could never forgive myself if I were the cause of that."
"You won't be," said Dicky sententiously, looking at his watch.
"But I must ask—must demand—the privilege of one parting word," said

Arthur firmly. "Do not be apprehensive of any painful scene. I desire

only to wish her every happiness, and to bid her farewell."
Mr. Dod, though on the eve of his wedding day, was not wholly oblivious

of the love affairs of other people. I could see a new-born and

overwhelming comprehension of the situation in his face as he put his

head in at the door and beckoned to Isabel. Evidently he could not trust

himself to speak.
"Miss Portheris," he said, with magnificent self-control, "Mr. Page. Mr.

Page would like to wish you every happiness and to bid you farewell,

Isabel, and I don't see why he shouldn't. We have still five minutes."
There are limits to the propriety of all practical jokes, and I walked

out at once to assure Arthur that his misunderstanding was quite

natural, and somewhat less exquisitely humorous than Mr. Dod appeared to

find it.
"I am merely eloping too," I said, "in case anything should happen to

Isabel." Realising that this was also being misinterpreted, I added,

"She is not accustomed to travelling alone."
We had shaken hands, and that always makes a situation more normal, but

there was still plainly an enormous amount to clear up, and painfully

little time to do it in, though Dicky with great consideration

immediately put Isabel into the carriage and followed her to its

remotest corner, leaving me standing at the door, and Arthur holding it

open. The second bell rang as I learned from Mr. Page that the

Pattersons had gone to Newport this summer, and that it was extremely

hot in New York when he left. As the guard came along the platform

shutting up the doors of the train, Arthur's agitation increased, and I

saw that his customary suffering in connection with me, was quite as

great as anybody could desire. The guard had skipped our carriage, but

it was already vibrating in departure—creaking—moving. I looked at

Arthur in a manner—I confess it—which annihilated our two months of

separation.
"Then since you're not going to marry Dod," he inquired breathlessly,

walking along with the train—"I've heard various reports—whom, may I

ask, are you going to marry?"
"Why, nobody," I said, "unless——"
"Well, I should think so!" ejaculated Arthur, and in spite of the

frightful German language used by the guard, he jumped into the

carriage.
He has maintained ever since that he was obliged to do it in order to

explain his presence on the platform, which was, of course, carrying the

matter to its logical conclusion. It seemed that the Senator had advised

him to come over and meet us accidentally in Venice, where he had

intimated that reunion would be only a question of privacy and a full

moon. On his arrival at Venice—it was his gondola that we shared—the

Senator had discouraged him for the moment, and had since constantly

telegraphed him that the opportune moment had not yet arrived. Finally

poppa had written to say that, though he grieved to announce that I

was engaged to Dicky, and he could not guarantee any disengagement, he

was still operating to that end. This, however, precipitated Mr. Page to

Cologne, where observation of our movements at a distance brought him to

the wrong conclusion, but fortunately to the right platform. As Isabel

remarked, if such things were put in books nobody would believe them.
"Whom are you going to marry?"
"Whom are you going to marry?"
It seemed quite unreasonable and absurd when we talked it over that

Arthur and I should travel from Cologne to Dover merely to witness the

nuptials of Dicky and Isabel. As Dicky pointed out, moreover, our moral

support when it came to the interview with Mrs. Portheris would be much

more valuable if it were united. There would be the registrar—one

registrar would do—and there would be the opportunity of making it a

square party. These were Dicky's arguments; Arthur's were more personal

but equally convincing, and I must admit that I thought a good deal of

the diplomatic anticipation of that magnificent wedding which was to

illustrate and adorn the survival of the methods of the Doge of Venice

in the family of a Senator of Chicago. And thus it was that we were all

married sociably together in Dover the following morning, despatching a

telegram immediately afterwards to the Senator at the Cologne hotel as

follows:
"We have eloped.
(Signed) R. and I. Dod.
A. and M. Page."
Later on in the day we added details, to show that we bore no malice,

and announced that we were prepared to await the arrival of the rest of

the party for any length of time at Dover.
We even went down to the station to meet them, where recriminations and

congratulations were so mingled that it was impossible, for some time,

to tell whether we were most blessed or banned. Even in the confusion of

the moment, however, I noticed that Mr. Mafferton made Miss Callis's

baggage his special care, and saw clearly in the cordiality of her

sentiments toward me, and the firmness of her manner in ordering him

about, that the future peer had reached his last alternative.
I rejoice to add that the day also showed that even Count Filgiatti had

fallen, in the general ordering of fates, upon happiness with honour. I

noticed that Emmeline vigorously protected him from the Customs officer

who wished to confiscate his cigarettes, and I mentioned her air of

proprietorship to her father.
"Why, yes," said Mr. Malt, "he offered himself as a count you see, and

Emmeline seemed to think she'd like to have one, so I closed with him.

There isn't anything likely to come of it for three or four years, but

he's willing to wait, and she's got to grow."
I expressed my felicitations, and Mr. Malt added somewhat regretfully

that it would have been better if he'd had more in his clothes, but that

was what you had to expect with counts; as a rule they didn't seem to

have what you might call any money use for pockets. In the meantime

they were taking him home to educate him in the duties of American

citizenship. Emmeline put it to me briefly, "I'm not any Daisy Miller,"

she said, "and I prefer to live out of Rome."
Once a year the present Lady Mafferton invites Mrs. Portheris to tea,

and I know they discuss my theory of engagements in a critical spirit.

We have never seen either Miss Nancy or Miss Cora Bingham again, and I

should have forgotten the names of Mr. Pabbley and Mr. Hinkson by this

time if I had not written them down in earlier chapters. Arthur and I

have not yet made up our minds to another visit to England. We have

several friends there, however, whom we appreciate exceedingly, in

spite, as we often say to one another, of their absurd and deplorable

accent.

"Southern humor is droll and thoroughly genuine, and Colonel Johnston is

one of its prophets. The Widow Guthrie is admirably drawn. She would

have delighted Thackeray. The story which bears her name is one of the

best studies of Southern life which we possess."—Christian Union.
THE PRIMES AND THEIR NEIGHBORS. Illustrated by Kemble, Frost,

and others. 12mo. Cloth, uniform with "Widow Guthrie," $1.25. Also in

paper, not illustrated, 50 cents.
"The South ought to erect a monument in gratitude to Richard Malcolm

Johnston. While scores of writers have been looking for odd Southern

characters and customs and writing them up as curiosities, Mr. Johnston

has been content to tell stories in which all the people are such as

might be found in almost any Southern village before the war, and the

incidents are those of the social life of the people, uncomplicated by

anything which happened during the late unpleasantness."—New York

Herald.
"These ten short stories are full of queer people, who not only talk but

act in a sort of dialect. Their one interest is their winning oddity.

They are as truly native to the soil as are the people of 'Widow

Guthrie.' In both books the humor is genuine, and the local coloring is

bright and attractive."—New York Commercial Advertiser.
THE CHRONICLES OF MR. BILL WILLIAMS. (Dukesborough Tales.) 12mo.

Paper, 50 cents; cloth, with Portrait of the Author, $1.00.
"A delightful originality characterizes these stories, which may take a

high rank in our native fiction that depicts the various phases of the

national life. Their humor is equally genuine and keen, and their pathos

is delicate and searching."—Boston Saturday Evening Gazette.
"Stripped of their bristling envelope of dialect, the core of these

experiences emerges as lumps of pure comedy, as refreshing as traveler's

trees in a thirsty land; and the literary South may be grateful that it

has a living writer able and willing to cultivate a neglected patch of

its wide domain with such charming skill."—The Critic.
MR. FORTNER'S MARITAL CLAIMS, and Other Stories. 16mo. Boards, 50

cents.
"When the last story is finished we feel, in imitation of Oliver Twist,

like asking for more."—Public Opinion.
"Quaint and lifelike pictures, as characteristic in dialect as in

description, of Georgia scenes and characters, and the quaintness of its

humor is entertaining and delightful."—Washington Public Opinion.

BEATRICE WHITBY'S NOVELS. Each, 12mo, cloth, $1.00; paper, 50 cents.
SUNSET.
"'Sunset' will fully meet the expectations of Miss Whitby's many

admirers, while for those (if such there be) who may not know her former

books it will form a very appetizing introduction to these justly

popular stories."—London Globe.
THE AWAKENING OF MARY FENWICK.
"Miss Whitby is far above the average novelist.... This story is

original without seeming ingenious, and powerful without being

overdrawn."—New York Commercial Advertiser.
PART OF THE PROPERTY.
"The book is a thoroughly good one. The theme is the rebellion of a

spirited girl against a match which has been arranged for her without

her knowledge or consent.... It is refreshing to read a novel in which

there is not a trace of slipshod work."—London Spectator.
A MATTER OF SKILL.
"A very charming love story, whose heroine is drawn with original skill

and beauty, and whom everybody will love for her splendid if very

independent character."—Boston Home Journal.
ONE REASON WHY.
"A remarkably well-written story.... The author makes her people speak

the language of everyday life, and a vigorous and attractive realism

pervades the book."—Boston Saturday Evening Gazette.
IN THE SUNTIME OF HER YOUTH.
"The story has a refreshing air of novelty, and the people that figure

in it are depicted with a vivacity and subtlety that are very

attractive."—Boston Beacon.
MARY FENWICK'S DAUGHTER.
"A novel which will rank high among those of the present

season."-Boston Advertiser.
ON THE LAKE OF LUCERNE, and other Stories. 16mo. Boards, with

specially designed cover, 50 cents.
"Six short stories carefully and conscientiously finished, and told with

the graceful ease of the practiced raconteur."—Literary Digest.
"Very dainty, not only in mechanical workmanship but in matter and

manner."—Boston Advertiser.

SOME NOTABLE AMERICAN FICTION in APPLETONS' TOWN AND COUNTRY LIBRARY.

Each, 12mo, cloth, $1.00; paper, 50 cents.
A COLONIAL FREE-LANCE. By Chauncey C. Hotchkiss,

author of "In Defiance of the King."
"We have had stories of the Revolution dealing with its statesmen, its

soldiers, and its home life, but the good books relating to adventure by

sea have been few and far between. The best of these for many a moon is

'A Colonial Free-Lance' There is a rattle and dash, a continuity of

adventure that constantly chains the reader's attention and makes the

book delightful reading."—Philadelphia Inquirer.
THE SUN OF SARATOGA. By Joseph A. Altsheler.
"Taken altogether, 'The Sun of Saratoga' is the best historical novel of

American origin that has been written for years, if not, indeed, in a

fresh, simple, unpretending, unlabored, manly way, that we have ever

read."—New York Mail and Express.
MASTER ARDICK, BUCCANEER. By F.H. Costello.
"This story is one of the real old-fashioned kind that novel readers

will take delight in perusing. There are incident and adventure in

plenty. The characters are bold, knightly, and chivalrous, and

delightful entertainers."—Boston Courier.
THE INTRIGUERS. A Novel. By John D. Barry.
"The story is a wholesome, enlivening bit of romance. It rings pure and

sweet, and is most happy in its characterizations."—Boston Herald.
"A bright society novel, sparkling with wit and entertaining from

beginning to end."—Boston Times.
IN DEFIANCE OF THE KING. A Romance of the American Revolution. By

Chauncey C. Hotchkiss.
"Thrills from beginning to end with the spirit of the Revolution.... His

whole story is so absorbing that you will sit up far into the night to

finish it, and lay it aside with the feeling that you have seen a

gloriously true picture of the Revolution."—Boston Herald.
IN OLD NEW ENGLAND. The Romance of a Colonial Fireside. By

Hezekiah Butterworth.
"We do not remember any other volume which holds within its covers a

series of such charming legends and traditions of New England's earlier

history.... 'In Old New England' possesses a charm rare indeed. It will

be welcomed by young and old alike."—New York Mail and Express.
