TRUXTON KING
A STORY OF GRAUSTARK

CHAPTER I
TRUXTON KING
He was a tall, rawboned, rangy young fellow with a

face so tanned by wind and sun you had the impression

that his skin would feel like leather if you could affect

the impertinence to test it by the sense of touch. Not

that you would like to encourage this bit of impudence

after a look into his devil-may-care eyes; but you might

easily imagine something much stronger than brown

wrapping paper and not quite so passive as burnt clay.

His clothes fit him loosely and yet were graciously devoid

of the bagginess which characterises the appearance

of extremely young men whose frames are not fully

set and whose joints are still parading through the last

stages of college development. This fellow, you could

tell by looking at him, had been out of college from two

to five years; you could also tell, beyond doubt or contradiction,

that he had been in college for his full allotted

time and had not escaped the usual number of "conditions"

that dismay but do not discourage the happy-go-lucky

undergraduate who makes two or three teams with

comparative ease, but who has a great deal of difficulty

with physics or whatever else he actually is supposed to

acquire between the close of the football season and the

opening of baseball practice.
This tall young man in the panama hat and grey flannels

was Truxton King, embryo globe-trotter and

searcher after the treasures of Romance. Somewhere

up near Central Park, in one of the fashionable cross

streets, was the home of his father and his father's father

before him: a home which Truxton had not seen in two

years or more. It is worthy of passing notice, and that

is all, that his father was a manufacturer; more than

that, he was something of a power in the financial world.

His mother was not strictly a social queen in the great

metropolis, but she was what we might safely call one

of the first "ladies in waiting." Which is quite good

enough for the wife of a manufacturer; especially when

one records that her husband was a manufacturer of

steel. It is also a matter of no little consequence that

Truxton's mother was more or less averse to the steel

business as a heritage for her son. Be it understood,

here and now, that she intended Truxton for the diplomatic

service: as far removed from sordid steel as the

New York post office is from the Court of St. James.
But neither Truxton's father, who wanted him to be a

manufacturing Croesus, or Truxton's mother, who expected

him to become a social Solomon, appears to have

taken the young man's private inclinations into consideration.

Truxton preferred a life of adventure distinctly

separated from steel and velvet; nor was he slow

to set his esteemed parents straight in this respect. He

had made up his mind to travel, to see the world, to be a

part of the big round globe on which we, as ordinary

individuals with no personality beyond the next block,

are content to sit and encourage the single ambition to

go to Europe at least once, so that we may not be left

out of the general conversation.
Young Mr. King believed in Romance. He had believed

in Santa Claus and the fairies, and he grew up

with an ever increasing bump of imagination, contiguous

to which, strange to relate, there was a properly

developed bump of industry and application. Hence, it is

not surprising that he was willing to go far afield in

search of the things that seemed more or less worth while

to a young gentleman who had suffered the ill-fortune

to be born in the nineteenth century instead of the seventeenth.

Romance and adventure, politely amorous but

vigorously attractive, came up to him from the seventeenth

century, perhaps through the blood of some

swash-buckling ancestor, and he was held enthralled by

the possibilities that lay hidden in some far off or even

nearby corner of this hopelessly unromantic world of

the twentieth century.
To be sure there was war, but war isn't Romance. Besides,

he was too young to fight against Spain; and,

later on, he happened to be more interested in football

than he was in the Japs or the Russians. The only thing

left for him to do was to set forth in quest of adventure;

adventure was not likely to apply to him in Fifth Avenue

or at the factory or—still, there was a certain kind

of adventure analogous to Broadway, after all. He

thought it over and, after trying it for a year or two,

decided that Broadway and the Tenderloin did not produce

the sort of Romance he could cherish for long as

a self-respecting hero, so he put certain small temptations

aside, chastened himself as well as he could, and

set out for less amiable but more productive by-ways

in other sections of the globe.
We come upon him at last—luckily for us we were not

actually following him—after two years of wonderful

but rather disillusioning adventure in mid-Asia and all

Africa. He had seen the Congo and the Euphrates, the

Ganges and the Nile, the Yang-tse-kiang and the

Yenisei; he had climbed mountains in Abyssinia, in

Siam, in Thibet and Afghanistan; he had shot big game

in more than one jungle, and had been shot at by small

brown men in more than one forest, to say nothing of the

little encounters he had had in most un-Occidental towns

and cities. He had seen women in Morocco and Egypt

and Persia and—But it is a waste of time to enumerate.

Strange to say, he was now drifting back toward the

civilisation which we are pleased to call our own, with a

sense of genuine disappointment in his heart. He had

found no sign of Romance.
Adventure in plenty, but Romance—ah, the fairy

princesses were in the story books, after all.
Here he was, twenty-six years old, strong and full of the

fire of life, convincing himself that there was nothing for

him to do but to drift back to dear old New York and

talk to his father about going into the offices; to let

his mother tell him over and over again of the nice girls

she knew who did not have to be rescued from ogres and

all that sort of thing in order to settle down to domestic

obsolescence; to tell his sister and all of their mutual

friends the whole truth and nothing but the truth concerning

his adventures in the wilds, and to feel that the

friends, at least, were predestined to look upon him as a

fearless liar, nothing more.
For twenty days he had travelled by caravan across the

Persian uplands, through Herat, and Meshed and

Bokhara, striking off with his guide alone toward the

Sea of Aral and the eastern shores of the Caspian,

thence through the Ural foothills to the old Roman highway

that led down into the sweet green valleys of a land

he had thought of as nothing more than the creation of

a hairbrained fictionist.
Somewhere out in the shimmering east he had learned,

to his honest amazement, that there was such a land as

Graustark. At first he would not believe. But the English

bank in Meshed assured him that he would come to

it if he travelled long enough and far enough into the

north and west and if he were not afraid of the hardships

that most men abhor. The dying spirit of Romance

flamed up in his heart; his blood grew quick again

and eager. He would not go home until he had sought

out this land of fair women and sweet tradition. And

so he traversed the wild and dangerous Tartar roads for

days and days, like the knights of Scheherazade in the

times of old, and came at last to the gates of Edelweiss.
Not until he sat down to a rare dinner in the historic

Hotel Regengetz was he able to realise that he was truly

in that fabled, mythical land of Graustark, quaint, grim

little principality in the most secret pocket of the earth's

great mantle. This was the land of his dreams, the land

of his fancy; he had not even dared to hope that it

actually existed.
And now, here he was, pinching himself to prove that

he was awake, stretching his world-worn bones under a

dainty table to which real food was being brought by—well,

he was obliged to pinch himself again. From the

broad terrace after dinner he looked out into the streets

of the quaint, picture-book town with its mediæval simplicity

and ruggedness combined; his eyes tried to keep

pace with the things that his fertile brain was seeing

beyond the glimmering lights and dancing window

panes—for the whole scene danced before him with a

persistent unreality that made him feel his own pulse in

the fear that some sudden, insidious fever had seized

upon him.
If any one had told him, six months before, that there

was such a land as Graustark and that if he could but

keep on travelling in a certain direction he would come

to it in time, he would have laughed that person to

scorn, no matter how precise a geographer he might have

been.
Young Mr. King, notwithstanding his naturally reckless

devotion to first impressions, was a much wiser person

than when he left his New York home two years before.

Roughing it in the wildest parts of the world

had taught him that eagerness is the enemy of common

sense. Therefore he curbed the thrilling impulse to fare

forth in search of diversion on this first night; he conquered

himself and went to bed early—and to sleep at

once, if that may serve to assist you in getting an idea

of what time and circumstances had done for his character.
A certain hard-earned philosophy had convinced him

long ago that adventure is quite content to wait over

from day to day, but that when a man is tired and worn

it isn't quite sensible to expect sleep to be put off regardless.

With a fine sense of sacrifice, therefore, he went to

bed, forsaking the desire to tread the dim streets of a

city by night in advance of a more cautious survey by

daylight. He had come to know that it is best to make

sure of your ground, in a measure, at least, before taking

too much for granted—to look before you leap, so

to speak. And so, his mind tingling with visions of fair

ladies and goodly opportunities, he went to sleep—and

did not get up to breakfast until noon the next day.
And now it becomes my deplorable duty to divulge the

fact that Truxton King, after two full days and nights

in the city of Edelweiss, was quite ready to pass on to

other fields, completely disillusionised in his own mind,

and not a little disgusted with himself for having gone

to the trouble to visit the place. To his intense chagrin,

he had found the quaint old city very tiresome. True,

it was a wonderful old town, rich in tradition, picturesque

in character, hoary with age, bulging with the

secrets of an active past; but at present, according to

the well travelled Truxton, it was a poky old place about

which historians either had lied gloriously or had been

taken in shamelessly. In either case, Edelweiss was not

what he had come to believe it would be. He had travelled

overland for nearly a month, out of the heart of

Asia, to find himself, after all, in a graveyard of great

expectations!
He had explored Edelweiss, the capital. He had ridden

about the ramparts; he had taken snapshots of the fortress

down the river and had not been molested; he had

gone mule-back up the mountain to the snowcapped

monastery of St. Valentine, overtopping and overlooking

the green valleys below; he had seen the tower in

which illustrious prisoners were reported to have been

held; he had ridden over the King's Road to Ganlook

and had stood on American bridges at midnight—all the

while wondering why he was there. Moreover, he had

traversed the narrow, winding streets of the city by day

and night; never, in all his travels, had he encountered a

more peaceful, less spirit-stirring place or populace.
Everybody was busy, and thrifty, and law abiding.

He might just as well have gone to Prague or Nuremburg;

either was as old and as quaint and as stupid

as this lukewarm city in the hills.
Where were the beautiful women he had read about and

dreamed of ever since he left Teheran? On his soul, he

had not seen half a dozen women in Edelweiss who were

more than passably fair to look upon. True, he had to

admit, the people he had seen were of the lower and

middle classes—the shopkeepers and the shopgirls, the

hucksters and the fruit vendors. What he wanted to

know was this: What had become of the royalty and

the nobility of Graustark? Where were the princes, the

dukes and the barons, to say nothing of the feminine

concomitants to these excellent gentlemen?
What irritated him most of all was the amazing discovery

that there was a Cook's tourist office in town and

that no end of parties arrived and departed under his

very nose, all mildly exhilarated over the fact that they

had seen Graustark! The interpreter, with "Cook's" on

his cap, was quite the most important, if quite the least

impressive personage in town. It is no wonder that this

experienced globe-trotter was disgusted!
There was a train to Vienna three times a week. He

made up his mind that he would not let the Saturday

express go down without him. He had done some

emphatic sputtering because he had neglected to take

the one on Thursday.
Shunning the newly discovered American club in Castle

Avenue as if it were a pest house, he lugubriously wandered

the streets alone, painfully conscious that the

citizens, instead of staring at him with admiring eyes,

were taking but little notice of him. Tall young Americans

were quite common in Edelweiss in these days.
One dingy little shop in the square interested him. It

was directly opposite the Royal Café (with American

bar attached), and the contents of its grimy little windows

presented a peculiarly fascinating interest to him.

Time and again, he crossed over from the Café garden to

look into these windows. They were packed with weapons

and firearms of such ancient design that he wondered

what they could have been used for, even in the Middle

Ages. Once he ventured inside the little shop. Finding

no attendant, he put aside his suddenly formed impulse

to purchase a mighty broadsword. From somewhere in

the rear of the building came the clanging of steel hammers,

the ringing of highly tempered metals; but, although

he pounded vigorously with his cane, no one came

forth to attend him.
On several occasions he had seen a grim, sharp-featured

old man in the doorway of the shop, but it was not until

after he had missed the Thursday train that he made up

his mind to accost him and to have the broadsword at

any price. With this object in view, he quickly crossed

the square and inserted his tall frame into the narrow

doorway, calling out lustily for attention. So loudly

did he shout that the multitude of ancient swords and

guns along the walls seemed to rattle in terror at this

sudden encroachment of the present.
"What is it?" demanded a sharp, angry voice at his

elbow. He wheeled and found himself looking into the

wizened, parchment-like face of the little old man, whose

black eyes snapped viciously. "Do you think I am

deaf?"
"I didn't know you were here," gasped Truxton, forgetting

to be surprised by the other's English. "The

place looked empty. Excuse me for yelling."
"What do you want?"
"That broad—Say, you speak English, don't you?"
"Certainly," snapped the old man. "Why shouldn't I?

I can't afford an interpreter. You'll find plenty of

English used here in Edelweiss since the Americans and

British came. They won't learn our language, so we

must learn theirs."
"You speak it quite as well as I do."
"Better, young man. You are an American." The

sarcasm was not lost on Truxton King, but he was not

inclined to resent it. A twinkle had come into the eyes

of the ancient; the deep lines about his lips seemed

almost ready to crack into a smile.
"What's the price of that old sword you have in the

window?"
"Do you wish to purchase it?"
"Certainly."
"Three hundred gavvos."
"What's that in dollars?"
"Four hundred and twenty."
"Whew!"
"It is genuine, sir, and three hundred years old. Old

Prince Boris carried it. It's most rare. Ten years ago

you might have had it for fifty gavvos. But," with a

shrug of his thin shoulders, "the price of antiquities has

gone up materially since the Americans began to come.

They don't want a thing if it is cheap."
"I'll give you a hundred dollars for it, Mr.—er—" he

looked at the sign on the open door—"Mr. Spantz."
"Good day, sir." The old man was bowing him out of

the shop. King was amused.
"Let's talk it over. What's the least you'll take in real

money?"
"I don't want your money. Good day."
Truxton King felt his chin in perplexity. In all his

travels he had found no other merchant whom he could

not "beat down" two or three hundred per cent. on an

article.
"It's too much. I can't afford it," he said, disappointment

in his eyes.
"I have modern blades of my own make, sir, much

cheaper and quite as good," ventured the excellent Mr.

Spantz.
"You make 'em?" in surprise.
The old man straightened his bent figure with sudden

pride. "I am armourer to the crown, sir. My blades are

used by the nobility—not by the army, I am happy to

say. Spantz repairs the swords and guns for the army,

but he welds only for the gentlemen at court."
"I see. Tradition, I suppose."
"My great-grandfather wrought blades for the princes

a hundred years ago. My son will make them after I

am gone, and his son after him. I, sir, have made the

wonderful blade with the golden hilt and scabbard which

the little Prince carries on days of state. It was two

years in the making. There is no other blade so fine.

It is so short that you would laugh at it as a weapon,

and yet you could bend it double. Ah, there was a

splendid piece of work, sir. You should see the little

toy to appreciate it. There are diamonds and rubies

worth 50,000 gavvos set in the handle. Ah, it is—"
Truxton's eyes were sparkling once more. Somehow

he was amused by the sudden garrulousness of the old

armourer. He held up his hand to check the flow of

words.
"I say, Herr Spantz, or Monsieur, perhaps, you are the

first man I've met who has volunteered to go into rhapsodies

for my benefit. I'd like to have a good long chat

with you. What do you say to a mug of that excellent

beer over in the Café garden? Business seems to be a

little dull. Can't you—er—lock up?"
Spantz looked at him keenly under his bushy brows, his

little black eyes fairly boring holes into King's brain, so

to speak.
"May I ask what brings you to Edelweiss?" he asked

abruptly.
"I don't mind telling you, Mr. Spantz, that I'm here

because I'm somewhat of a fool. False hopes led me

astray. I thought Graustark was the home, the genesis

of Romance, and I'm more or less like that chap we've

read about, who was always in search of adventure.

Somehow, Graustark hasn't come up to expectations.

Up to date, this is the slowest burg I've ever seen. I'm

leaving next Saturday for Vienna."
"I see," cackled Spantz, his eyes twinkling with mirth.

"You thought you could capture wild and beautiful

princesses here just as you pleased, eh? Let me tell you,

young man, only one American—only one foreigner, in

fact—has accomplished that miracle. Mr. Lorry came

here ten years ago and won the fairest flower Graustark

ever produced-the beautiful Yetive—but he was the

only one. I suppose you are surprised to find Graustark

a solid, prosperous, God-fearing little country, whose

people are wise and happy and loyal. You have learned,

by this time, that we have no princesses for you to protect.

It isn't as it was when Mr. Lorry came and found

Her Serene Highness in mediæval difficulties. There is

a prince on the throne to-day—you've seen him?"
"No. I'm not looking for princes. I've seen hundreds

of 'em in all parts of the world."
"Well, you should see Prince Robin before you scoff.

He's the most wonderful little man in all the world."
"I've heard of nothing but him, my good Mr. Spantz.

He's seven years old and he looks like his mother and he's

got a jewelled sword and all that sort of thing. I daresay

he's a nice little chap. Got American blood in him,

you see."
"Do not let any one hear you laugh about him, sir.

The people worship him. If you laugh too publicly, you

may have your hands full of adventures in a very few

minutes—and your body full of fine steel blades. We

are very proud of our Prince."
"I beg your pardon, Mr. Spantz. I didn't mean lesé

majesté. I'm bored, that's all. You wouldn't blame me

for being sore if you'd come as far as I have and got as

little for your pains. Why, hang it all, this morning

that confounded man from Cook's had a party of twenty-two

American school-teachers and Bible students in the

Castle grounds and I had to stand on my toes outside

the walls for two hours before I could get a permit to

enter. American engineers are building the new railroad;

American capital controls the telephone and electric light

companies; there are two American moving picture

shows in Regengetz Circus and an American rush hand

laundry two blocks up. And you can get Bourbon

whisky anywhere. It's sickening."
"The Americans have done much for Edelweiss, sir.

We don't resent their progressiveness. They have given

us modern improvements without overthrowing ancient

customs. My dear young sir, we are very old here—and

very honest. That reminds me that I should accept

your kind invitation to the Café garden. If you will

bear with me for just one moment, sir." With this

polite request, the old man retired to the rear of the

shop and called out to some one upstairs. A woman's

voice answered. The brief conversation which followed

was in a tongue unknown to King.
"My niece will keep shop, sir, while I am out," Spantz

explained, taking his hat from a peg behind the door.

Truxton could scarcely restrain a smile as he glanced

over his queer little old guest. He looked eighty but was

as sprightly as a man of forty. A fine companion for

a youth of twenty-six in search of adventure!
They paused near the door until the old man's niece

appeared at the back of the shop. King's first glance

at the girl was merely a casual one. His second was

more or less in the nature of a stare of amazement.
A young woman of the most astounding beauty, attired

in the black and red of the Graustark middle classes,

was slowly approaching from the shadowy recesses at the

end of the shop. She gave him but a cursory glance, in

which no interest was apparent, and glided quietly into

the little nook behind the counter, almost at his elbow.

His heart enjoyed a lively thump. Here was the first

noticeably good-looking woman he had seen in Edelweiss,

and, by the powers, she was a sword-maker's niece!
The old man looked sharply at him for an instant, and

a quick little smile writhed in and out among the mass

of wrinkles. Instead of passing directly out of the shop,

Spantz stopped a moment to give the girl some suddenly

recalled instruction. Truxton King, you may be sure,

did not precede the old man into the street. He deliberately

removed his hat and waited most politely for

age to go before youth, in the meantime blandly gazing

upon the face of this amazing niece.
Across the square, at one of the tables, he awaited his

chance and a plausible excuse for questioning the old

man without giving offence. Somewhere back in his impressionable

brain there was growing a distinct hope

that this beautiful young creature with the dreamy eyes

was something more than a mere shopgirl. It had occurred

to him in that one brief moment of contact that

she had the air, the poise of a true aristocrat.
The old man, over his huge mug of beer, was properly

grateful. He was willing to repay King for his little

attention by giving him a careful history of Graustark,

past, present and future, from the time of Tartar rule

to the time of the so-called "American invasion." ills

glowing description of the little Prince might have interested

Truxton in his Lord Fauntleroy days, but just at

present he was more happily engaged in speculating on

the true identify of the girl in the gun-shop. He recalled

the fact that a former royal princess of Graustark

had gone sight-seeing over the world, incognita,

as a Miss Guggenslocker, and had been romantically

snatched up by a lucky American named Lorry. What

if this girl in the gun-shop should turn out to be a—well,

he could hardly hope for a princess; but she might

be a countess.
The old mart was rambling on. "The young Prince has

lived most of his life in Washington and London and

Paris, sir. He's only seven, sir. Of course, you remember

the dreadful accident that made him an orphan

and put him on the throne with the three 'wise men of

the East' as regents or governors. The train wreck

near Brussels, sir? His mother, the glorious Princess

Yetive, was killed and his father, Mr. Lorry, died the

next day from his injuries. That, sir, was a most appalling

blow to the people of Graustark. We loved the

Princess and we admired her fine American husband.

There never will be another pair like them, sir. And to

think of them being destroyed as they were—in the most

dreadful way, sir. Their coach was demolished, you

remember. I—I will not go into the details. You know

them, of course. God alone preserved the little Prince.

He was travelling with them, on the way from London to

Edelweiss. By some strange intervention of Providence

he had gone with his governess and other members of

the party to the luggage van in the fore part of the

train, which had stopped on a side track below the station.

The collision was from the rear, a broken rail

throwing a locomotive into the Princess's coach. This

providential escape of the young Prince preserved the

unbroken line of the present royal family. If he had

been killed, the dynasty would have come to an end, and,

I am telling no secret, sir, when I say that a new form

of government would have followed."
"What sort of government?"
"A more modern system, sir. Perhaps socialistic. I

can't say. At all events, a new dynasty could not have

been formed. The people would have rejected it. But

Prince Robin was spared and, if I do say it, sir, he is the

manliest little prince in all the world. You should see

him ride and fence and shoot—and he is but seven!"
"I say, Mr. Spantz, I don't believe I've told you that

your niece is a most remarkably beau—"
"As I was saying, sir," interrupted Spantz, so pointedly

that Truxton flushed, "the little Prince is the idol of all

the people. Under the present regency he is obliged

to reside in the principality until his fifteenth year, after

which he may be permitted to travel abroad. Graustark

intends to preserve him to herself if it is in her power

to do so. Woe betide the man who thinks or does ill

toward little Prince Robin."
King was suddenly conscious of a strange intentness of

gaze on the old man's part. A peculiar, indescribable

chill swept over him; he had a distinct, vivid impression

that some subtle power was exercising itself upon him—a

power that, for the briefest instant, held him in a grip

of iron. What it was, he could not have told; it passed

almost immediately. Something in the old man's eyes,

perhaps—or was it something in the queer smile that

flickered about his lips?
"My dear Mr. Spantz," he hastened to say, as if a

defence were necessary, "please don't get it into your

head that I'm thinking ill of the Prince. I daresay he's

a fine little chap and I'm sorry he's—er—lost his parents."
Spantz laughed, a soft, mirthless gurgle that caused

Truxton to wonder why he had made the effort at all.

"I imagine His Serene Highness has little to fear from

any American," he said quietly. "He has been taught to

love and respect the men of his father's land. He loves

America quite as dearly as he loves Graustark." Despite

the seeming sincerity of the remark, Truxton was

vaguely conscious that a peculiar harshness had crept

into the other's voice. He glanced sharply at the old

man's face. For the first time he noticed something sinister—yes,

evil—in the leathery countenance; a stealthiness

in the hard smile that seemed to transform it at once

into a pronounced leer. Like a flash there darted into the

American's active brain a conviction that there could

be no common relationship between this flinty old man

and the delicate, refined girl he had seen in the shop.

Now he recalled the fact that her dark eyes had a look

of sadness and dejection in their depths, and that her

face was peculiarly white and unsmiling.
Spantz was eyeing him narrowly. "You do not appear

interested in our royal family," he ventured coldly.
Truxton hastened to assure him that he was keenly interested.

Especially so, now that I appreciate that the

little Prince is the last of his race."
"There are three regents, sir, in charge of the affairs

of state—Count Halfont, the Duke of Perse and Baron

Jasto Dangloss, who is minister of police. Count Halfont

is a granduncle of the Prince, by marriage. The

Duke of Perse is the father of the unhappy Countess

Ingomede, the young and beautiful wife of the exiled

"Iron Count" Marlanx. No doubt you've heard of him."
"I've read something about him. Sort of a gay old

bounder, wasn't he? Seems to me I recall the stories that

were printed about him a few years ago. I remember

that he was banished from the principality and his estates

seized by the Crown."
"Quite true, sir. He was banished in 1901 and now

resides on his estates in Austria. Three years ago, in

Buda Pesth, he was married to Ingomede, the daughter

of the Duke. Count Marlanx has great influence at the

Austrian court. Despite the fact that he is a despised

and discredited man in his own country, he still is a

power among people high in the government of more

than one empire. The Duke of Perse realised this when

he compelled his daughter to accept him as her husband.

The fair Ingomede is less than twenty-five years of age;

the Iron Count is fully sixty-five."
"She ought to be rescued," was King's only comment,

but there was no mistaking the gleam of interest in his

steady grey eyes.
"Rescued?" repeated the old man, with a broad grin.

"And why? She is mistress of one of the finest old

castles in Austria, Schloss Marlanx, and she is quite

beautiful enough to have lovers by the score when the

Count grows a little blinder and less jealous. She is in

Edelweiss at present, visiting her father. The Count

never comes here."
"I'd like to see her if she's really beautiful. I've seen

but one pretty woman in this whole blamed town—your

niece, Herr Spantz. I've looked 'em over pretty carefully,

too. She is exceedingly attract—"
"Pardon me, sir, but it is not the custom in Graustark

to discuss our women in the public drinking places."

King felt as if he had received a slap in the face. He

turned a fiery red under his tan and mumbled some sort

of an apology. "The Countess is a public personage,

however, and we may speak of her," went on the old man

quickly, as the American, in his confusion, called a waiter

to replenish the tankards. The steely glitter that leaped

into the armourer's eyes at this second reference to his

niece disappeared as quickly as it came; somehow it left

behind the impression that he knew how to wield the

deadly blades he wrought.
"I'd like to hear more about her," murmured Mr. King.

"Anything to pass the time away, Mr. Spantz. As I

said before, I journeyed far to reach this land of fair

women and if there's one to be seen, I'm properly eager

to jump at the chance. I've been here two days and I've

seen nothing that could start up the faintest flutter

around my heart. I'm sorry to say, my good friend, that

the women I've seen in the streets of Edelweiss are not

beauties. I won't say that they'd stop a clock, but they'd

cause it to lose two or three hours a day, all right

enough."
"You will not find the beautiful women of Edelweiss in

the streets, sir."
"Don't they ever go out shopping?"
"Hardly. The merchants, if you will but notice, carry

their wares to the houses of the noble and the rich.

Graustark ladies of quality would no more think of

setting foot in a shop or bazaar than they would think

of entering a third class carriage. Believe me, there are

many beautiful women in the homes along Castle Avenue.

Noblemen come hundreds of miles to pay court to them."
"Just the same, I'm disgusted with the place. It's not

what it's cracked up to be. Saturday will see me on

my way."
"To-morrow the garrison at the fortress marches in

review before the Prince. If you should happen to be

on the avenue near the Castle gate at twelve o'clock, you

will see the beauty and chivalry of Graustark. The

soldiers are not the only ones who are on parade." There

was an unmistakable sneer in his tone.
"You don't care much for society, I'd say," observed

Truxton, with a smile.
Spantz's eyes flamed for an instant and then subtly resumed

their most ingratiating twinkle. "We cannot all

be peacocks," he said quietly. "You will see the Prince,

his court and all the distinguished men of the city and

the army. You will also see that the man who rides

beside the Prince's carriage wheel is an American, while

Graustark nobles take less exalted places."
"An American, eh?"
"Yes. Have you not heard of John Tullis, the Prince's

friend?"
"Another seven-year-old?"
"Not at all. A grown man, sir. He, your countryman,

is the real power behind our throne. On his deathbed,

the Prince's father placed his son in this American's

charge and begged him to stand by him through thick

and thin until the lad is able to take care of himself.

As if there were not loyal men in Graustark who might

have done as much for their Prince!"
King looked interested. "I see. The people, no doubt,

resent this espionage. Is that it?"
Spantz gave him a withering look, as much as to say

that he was a fool to ask such a question in a place so

public. Without replying, he got to his feet and made

ready to leave the little garden.
"I must return. I have been away too long. Thank

you, sir, for your kindness to an old man. Good day,

sir, and—"
"Hold on! I think I'll walk over with you and have

another look at that broadsword. I'm—"
"To-morrow, sir. It is past time to close the shop for

to-day. Come to-morrow. Good day."
He was crossing the sidewalk nimbly before King could

offer a word of remonstrance. With a disappointed sigh,

the American sank back in his chair, and watched his odd

companion scurry across the square. Suddenly he became

conscious of a disquieting feeling that some one

was looking at him intently from behind. He turned

in his chair and found himself meeting the gaze of a

ferocious looking, military appearing little man at a

table near by. To his surprise, the little man's fierce

stare maintained its peculiarly personal intentness until

he, himself, was compelled to withdraw his own gaze in

some little confusion and displeasure. His waiter appeared

at his elbow with the change.
"Who the devil is that old man at the table there?"

demanded young Mr. King loudly.
The waiter assumed a look of extreme insolence. "That

is Baron Dangloss, Minister of Police. Anything more,

sir?"
"Yes. What's he looking so hard at me for? Does he

think I'm a pickpocket?"
"You know as much as I, sir," was all that the waiter

said in reply. King pocketed the coin he had intended

for the fellow, and deliberately left the place. He could

not put off the feeling, however, that the intense stare of

Baron Dangloss, the watch-dog of the land, followed him

until the corner of the wall intervened. The now incensed

American glanced involuntarily across the square

in the direction of Spantz's shop. He saw three mounted

soldiers ride up to the curb and hail the armourer as he

started to close his doors. As he sauntered across the

little square his gaze suddenly shifted to a second-story

window above the gun-shop.
The interesting young woman had cautiously pushed

open one of the shutters and was peering down upon the

trio of red-coated guardsmen. Almost at the same instant

her quick, eager gaze fell upon the tall American,

now quite close to the horsemen. He saw her dark eyes

expand as if with surprise. The next instant he caught

his breath and almost stopped in his tracks.
A shy, impulsive smile played about her red lips for a

second, lighting up the delicate face with a radiance that

amazed him. Then the shutter was closed gently,

quickly. His first feeling of elation was followed instantly

by the disquieting impression that it was a mocking

smile of amusement and not one of inviting friendliness.

He felt his ears burn as he abruptly turned off to

the right, for, somehow, he knew that she was peeping

at him through the blinds and that something about his

tall, rangy figure was appealing to her sense of the

ridiculous.
You will see at once that Truxton King, imaginative

chap that he was, had pounced upon this slim, attractive

young woman as the only plausible heroine for his prospective

romance, and, as such, she could not be guilty of

forwardness or lack or dignity. Besides, first impressions

are always good ones: she had struck him at the outset

as being a girl of rare delicacy and refinement.
In the meantime, Baron Dangloss was watching him

covertly from the edge of the Café garden across the

square.

CHAPTER II
A MEETING OF THE CABINET
At this time, the principality of Graustark was in a

most prosperous condition. Its affairs were under the

control of an able ministry, headed by the venerable

Count Halfont. The Duke of Perse, for years a resident

of St. Petersburg, and a financier of high standing,

had returned to Edelweiss soon after the distressing

death of the late Princess Yetive and her American husband,

and to him was entrusted the treasury portfolio.

He at once proceeded to endear himself to the common

people by the advocacy of a lower rate of taxation; this

meant the reduction of the standing army. He secured

new and advantageous treaties with old and historic

foes, putting Graustark's financial credit upon a high

footing in the European capitals. The people smugly

regarded themselves as safe in the hands of the miserly

but honest old financier. If he accomplished many things

by way of office to enhance his own particular fortune,

no one looked askance, for he made no effort to blind or

deceive his people. Of his honesty there could be no

question; of his financial operations, it is enough to say

that the people were satisfied to have their affairs linked

with his.
The financing of the great railroad project by which

Edelweiss was to be connected with the Siberian line in

the north, fell to his lot at a time when no one else could

have saved the little government from heavy losses or

even bankruptcy. The new line traversed the country

from Serros, capital of Dawsbergen, through the mountains

and canyons of Graustark, across Axphain's broad

steppes and lowlands, to a point at which Russia stood

ready to begin a connecting branch for junction with

her great line to the Pacific. All told, it was a stupendous

undertaking for a small government to finance; it

is well known that Graustark owns and controls her public

utility institutions. The road, now about half completed,

was to be nearly two hundred miles in length, fully

two-thirds of which was on Graustark territory. The

preponderance of cost of construction fell upon that

principality, Dawsbergen and Axphain escaping with

comparatively small obligations owing to the fact that

they had few mountains to contend with. As a matter

of fact, the Dawsbergen and Axphain ends of the railroad

were now virtually built and waiting for the completion

of the extensive work in the Graustark highlands.
The opening of this narrative finds the ministry preparing

to float a new five million gavvo issue of bonds

for construction and equipment purposes. Agents of

the government were ready to depart for London and

Paris to take up the matter with the great banking

houses. St. Petersburg and Berlin were not to be given

the opportunity to gobble up these extremely fine securities.

This seemingly extraordinary exclusion of

Russian and German bidders was the result of vigorous

objections raised by an utter outsider, the American,

John Tullis, long time friend and companion of Grenfall

Lorry, consort to the late Princess.
Tullis was a strange man in many particulars. He

was under forty years of age, but even at that rather

immature time of life he had come to be recognised as

a shrewd, successful financial power in his home city,

New York. At the very zenith of his power he suddenly

and with Quixotic disregard for consequences gave up

his own business and came to Graustark for residence,

following a promise made to Grenfall Lorry when the

latter lay dying in a little inn near Brussels.
They had been lifelong friends. Tullis jestingly called

himself the little Prince's "morganatic godfather." For

two years he had been a constant resident of Graustark,

living contentedly, even indolently, in the picturesque old

Castle, his rooms just across the corridor from those

occupied by the little Prince. To this small but important

bit of royalty he was "Uncle Jack"; in that

capacity he was the most beloved and at the same time

the most abused gentleman in all Graustark. As many

as ten times a week he was signally banished from the

domain by the loving, headstrong little ruler, only to

be recalled with grave dignity and a few tears when he

went so far as to talk of packing his "duds" in obedience

to the edict.
John Tullis, strong character though he was, found

this lazy, dolce far niente life much to his liking. He

was devoted to the boy; he was interested in the life at

this tiny court. The days of public and court mourning

for the lamented Princess and her husband wearing away

after an established period, he found himself eagerly

delving into the gaieties that followed. Life at the Castle

and in the homes of the nobility provided a new and

sharp contrast to the busy, sordid existence he had known

at home. It was like a fine, wholesome, endless dream to

him. He drifted on the joyous, smiling tide of pleasure

that swept Edelweiss with its careless waves night and

day. Clever, handsome, sincere in his attitude of loyalty

toward these people of the topmost east, he was not long

in becoming a popular idol.
His wide-awake, resourceful brain, attuned by nature to

the difficulties of administration, lent itself capably to

the solving of many knotty financial puzzles; the ministry

was never loth to call on him for advice and seldom

disposed to disregard it. An outsider, he never offered a

suggestion or plan unasked; to this single qualification

he owed much of the popularity and esteem in which he

was held by the classes and the masses. Socially, he was

a great favourite. He enjoyed the freedom of the most

exclusive homes in Edelweiss. He had enjoyed the distinction

of more than one informal visit to old Princess

Volga of Axphain, just across the border, to say nothing

of shooting expeditions with young Prince Dantan of

Dawsbergen, whose American wife, formerly Miss Calhoun

of Washington, was a friend of long standing.
John Tullis was, beyond question, the most conspicuous

and the most admired man in Edelweiss in these serene

days of mentorship to the adored Prince Robin.
There was but one man connected with the government

to whom his popularity and his influence proved distasteful.

That man was the Duke of Perse. On more

than one occasion the cabinet had chosen to be guided

by the sagacity of John Tullis in preference to following

the lines laid down by the astute minister of finance.

The decision to offer the new bond issue in London and

Paris was due to the earnest, forceful argument of John

Tullis—outside the cabinet chamber, to be sure. This

was but one instance in which the plan of the treasurer

was overridden. He resented the plain though delicate

influence of the former Wall Street man. Tullis had

made it plain to the ministry that Graustark could not

afford to place itself in debt to the Russians, into whose

hands, sooner or later, the destinies of the railroad might

be expected to fall. The wise men of Graustark saw his

point without force of argument, and voted down, in the

parliament, the Duke's proposition to place the loan in

St. Petersburg and Berlin. For this particular act of

trespass upon the Duke's official preserves he won the

hatred of the worthy treasurer and his no inconsiderable

following among the deputies.
But John Tullis was not in Edelweiss for the purpose

of meddling with state affairs. He was there because he

elected to stand mentor to the son of his life-long friend,

even though that son was a prince of the blood and controlled

by the will of three regents chosen by his own

subjects. He was there to watch over the doughty little

chap, who one day would be ruler unrestrained, but who

now was a boy to be loved and coddled and reprimanded

in the general process of man-making.
To say that the tiny Prince loved his big, adoring

mentor would be putting it too gently: he idolised him.

Tullis was father, mother and big brother to the little

fellow in knickers.
The American was a big, broad shouldered man, reddish

haired and ruddy cheeked, with cool grey eyes; his

sandy mustache was closely cropped and turned up ever

so slightly at the corners of his mouth. Despite his

colouring, his face was somewhat sombre—even stern—when

in repose. It was his fine, enveloping smile that

made friends for him wherever he listed, with men and

with women. More frequently than otherwise it made

more than friends of the latter.
One woman in Graustark was the source of never-ending

and constantly increasing interest to this stalwart

companion to the Prince. That woman was, alas! the

wife of another man. Moreover, she was the daughter

of the Duke of Perse.
The young and witty Countess of Marlanx came often

to Edelweiss. She was a favourite at the Castle, notwithstanding

the unhealthy record of her ancient and

discredited husband, the Iron Count. Tullis had not seen

the Count, but he had heard such tales of him that he

could not but pity this glorious young creature who

called him husband. There is an old saying about the

kinship of pity. Not that John Tullis was actually in

love with the charming Countess. He was, to be perfectly

candid, very much interested in her and very much

distressed by the fact that she was bound to a venerable

reprobate who dared not put his foot on Graustark soil

because once he had defiled it atrociously.
But of the Countess and her visits to Edelweiss, more

anon—with the indulgence of the reader.
At present we are permitted to attend a meeting of

the cabinet, which sits occasionally in solemn collectiveness

just off the throne room within the tapestried walls

of a dark little antechamber, known to the outside world

as the "Room of Wrangles." It is ten o'clock of the

morning on which the Prince is to review the troops from

the fortress. The question under discussion relates to

the loan of 5,000,000 gavvos, before mentioned. At the

head of the long table, perched upon an augmentary pile

of law books surmounted by a little red cushion, sits the

Prince, almost lost in the hugh old walnut chair of his

forefathers. Down the table sit the ten ministers of the

departments of state, all of them loving the handsome

little fellow on the necessary pile of statutes, but all of

them more or less indifferent to his significant yawns and

perplexed frowns.
The Prince was a sturdy, curly-haired lad, with big

brown eyes and a lamentably noticeable scratch on his

nose—acquired in less stately but more profitable pursuits.

(It seems that he had peeled his nose while sliding

to second base in a certain American game that he was

teaching the juvenile aristocracy how to play.) His

wavy hair was brown and rebellious. No end of royal

nursing could keep it looking sleek and proper. He had

the merit of being a very bad little boy at times; that

is why he was loved by every one. Although it was considered

next to high treason to strike a prince of the

royal blood, I could, if I had the space, recount the details

of numerous fisticuffs behind the state stables in

which, sad to relate, the Prince just as often as not came

off with a battered dignity and a chastened opinion of

certain small fry who could not have been more than

dukes or barons at best. But he took his defeats manfully:

he did not whimper lesé majesté. John Tullis,

his "Uncle Jack," had proclaimed his scorn for a boy

who could not "take his medicine." And so Prince Robin

took it gracefully because he was prince.
To-day he was—for him—rather oppressively dignified

and imperial. He may have blinked his weary eyes a

time or two, but in the main he was very attentive, very

circumspect and very much puzzled. Custom required

that the ruling prince or princess should preside over

the meetings of the cabinet. It is needless to observe

that the present ruler's duty ended when he repeated

(after Count Halfont): "My lords, we are now in session."

The school-room, he confessed, was a "picnic"

compared to the "Room of Wrangles": a fellow got a

recess once in a while there, but here—well, the only

recess he got was when he fell asleep. To-day he was

determined to maintain a very dignified mien. It appears

that at the last meeting he had created considerable

havoc by upsetting the ink well while trying to fill his

fountain pen without an injector. Moreover, nearly half

a pint of the fluid had splashed upon the Duke of Perse's

trousers—and they were grey, at that. Whereupon the

Duke announced in open conclave that His Highness

needed a rattling good spanking—a remark which distinctly

hurt the young ruler's pride and made him wish

that there had been enough ink to drown the Duke instead

of merely wetting him.
About the table sat the three regents and the other

men high in the administration of affairs, among them

General Braze of the Army, Baron Pultz of the Mines,

Roslon of Agriculture. The Duke of Perse was discussing

the great loan question. The Prince was watching

his gaunt, saturnine face with more than usual

interest.
"Of course, it is not too late to rescind the order promulgated

at our last sitting. There are five bankers in

St. Petersburg who will finance the loan without delay.

We need not delay the interminable length of time necessary

to secure the attention and co-operation of bankers

in France and England. It is all nonsense to say that

Russia has sinister motives in the matter. It is a business

proposition—not an affair of state. We need the

money before the winter opens. The railroad is now

within fifteen miles of Edelweiss. The bridges and tunnels

are well along toward completion. Our funds are

diminishing, simply because we have delayed so long in

preparing for this loan. There has been too much bickering

and too much inane politics. I still maintain that

we have made a mistake in refusing to take up the matter

with St. Petersburg or Berlin. Why should we prefer

England? Why France?"
For some unaccountable reason he struck the table violently

with his fist and directed his glare upon the astonished

Prince. The explosive demand caught the ruler

by surprise. He gasped and his lips fell apart. Then

it must have occurred to him that the question could be

answered by no one save the person to whom it was so

plainly addressed. He lifted his chin and piped up

shrilly, and with a fervour that startled even the intense

Perse:
"Because Uncle Jack said we should, that's why."
We have no record of what immediately followed this

abrupt declaration; there are some things that never leak

out, no matter how prying the chronicler may be. When

one stops to consider that this was the first time a question

had been put directly to the Prince—and one that

he could understand, at that—we may be inclined to

overlook his reply, but we cannot answer for certain

members of the cabinet. Unconsciously, the boy in

knickers had uttered a truth that no one else had dared

to voice. John Tullis was the joint stepping-stone and

stumbling-block in the deliberations of the cabinet.
It goes without saying that the innocent rejoinder

opened the way to an acrid discussion of John Tullis. If

that gentleman's ears burned in response to the sarcastic

comments of the Duke of Perse and Baron Pultz, they

probably tingled pleasantly as the result of the stout

defence put up by Halfont, Dangloss and others. Moreover,

his most devoted friend, the Prince, whose lips were

sullenly closed after his unlucky maiden effort, was finding

it exceedingly difficult to hold his tongue and his

tears at the same time. The lad's lip trembled but his

brown eyes glowered; he sat abashed and heard the no

uncertain arraignment of his dearest friend, feeling all

the while that the manly thing for him to do would be to

go over and kick the Duke of Perse, miserably conscious

that such an act was impossible. His little body trembled

with childish rage; he never took his gaze from the face

of the gaunt traducer. How he hated the Duke of Perse!
The Duke's impassioned plea was of no avail. His

confrères saw the wisdom of keeping Russia's greedy

hand out of the country's affairs—at least for the present—and

reiterated their decision to seek the loans in

England and France. The question, therefore, would

not be taken to Parliament for reconsideration. The

Duke sat down, pale in defeat; his heart was more bitter

than ever against the shrewd American who had induced

all these men to see through his eyes.
"I suppose there is no use in kicking against the

pricks," he said sourly as he resumed his seat. "I shall

send our representatives to London and Paris next

month. I trust, my lords, that we may have no trouble

in placing the loans there." There was a deep significance

the dry tone which he assumed.
"I do not apprehend trouble," said Count Halfont.

"Our credit is still good, your Grace. Russia is not the

only country that is ready to trust us for a few millions.

Have no fear, your Grace."
"It is the delay that I am apprehensive of, your Excellency."
At this juncture the Prince, gathering from the manner

of his ministers that the question was settled to his liking,

leaned forward and announced to his uncle, the premier:
"I'm tired, Uncle Caspar. How much longer is it?"
Count Halfont coughed. "Ahem! Just a few minutes,

your Highness. Pray be patient—er—my little man."
Prince Bobby flushed. He always knew that he was

being patronised when any one addressed him as "my

little man."
"I have an engagement," he said, with a stiffening of

his back.
"Indeed?" said the Duke dryly.
"Yes, your Grace—a very important one. Of course,

I'll stay if I have to, but—what time is it, Uncle

Caspar?"
"It is half past eleven, your Highness."
"Goodness, I had a date for eleven. I mean a engagement—an

engagement." He glanced helplessly, appealingly

from Count Halfont to Baron Dangloss, his

known allies.
The Duke of Perse smiled grimly. In his most polite

manner he arose to address the now harassed Princeling,

who shifted uneasily on the pile of law books.
"May your most humble subject presume to inquire

into the nature of your Highness's engagement?"
"You may, your Grace," said the Prince.
The Duke waited. A smile crept into the eyes of the

others. "Well, what is the engagement?"
"I had a date to ride with Uncle Jack at eleven."
"And you imagine that 'Uncle Jack' will be annoyed if

he is kept waiting by such a trivial matter as a cabinet

meeting, unfortunately prolonged?"
"I don't know just what that means," murmured the

Prince. Then his face brightened. "But I don't think

he'll be sore after I tell him how busy we've been."
The Duke put his hand over his mouth. "I don't think

he'll mind half an hour's wait, do you?"
"He likes me to be very prompt."
Count Halfont interposed, good-humouredly. "There

is nothing more to come before us to-day, your Grace,

so I fancy we may as well close the meeting. To my

mind, it is rather a silly custom which compels us to keep

the Prince with us—er—after the opening of the session.

Of course, your Highness, we don't mean to say that you

are not interested in our grave deliberations."
Prince Bobby broke in eagerly: "Uncle Jack says I've

just got to be interested in 'em, whether I want to or not.

He says it's the only way to catch onto things and become

a regular prince. You see, Uncle Caspar, I've got

a lot to learn."
"Yes, your Highness, you have," solemnly admitted the

premier. "But I am sure you will learn."
"Under such an able instructor as Uncle Jack you may

soon know more than the wisest man in the realm," added

the Duke of Perse.
"Thank you, your Grace," said the Prince, so politely

that the Duke was confounded; "I know Uncle Jack will

be glad to hear that. He's—he's afraid people may

think he's butting in too much."
"Butting in?" gasped the premier.
At this the Duke of Perse came to his feet again, an

angry gleam in his eyes. "My lords," he began hastily,

"it must certainly have occurred to you before this that

our beloved Prince's English, which seems after all to

be his mother tongue, is not what it should be. Butting

in! Yesterday I overheard him advising your son,

Pultz, to 'go chase' himself. And when your boy tried

to chase himself—'pon my word, he did—what did our

Prince say? What did you say, Prince Robin?"
"I—I forget," stammered Prince Bobby.
"You said 'Mice!' Or was it—er—"
"No, your Grace. Rats. I remember. That's what I

said. That's what all of us boys used to say in Washington."
"God deliver us! Has it come to this, that a Prince of

Graustark should grow up with such language on his

lips? I fancy, my lords, you will all agree that something

should be done about it. It is too serious a matter.

We are all more or less responsible to the people he is to

govern. We cannot, in justice to them, allow him to

continue under the—er—influences that now seem to surround

him. He'll—he'll grow up to be a barbarian. For

Heaven's sake, my lords, let us consider the Prince's future—let

us deal promptly with the situation."
"What's he saying, Uncle Caspar?" whispered the

Prince fiercely.
"Sh!" cautioned Count Halfont.
"I won't sh! I am the Prince. And I'll say 'chase

yourself' whenever I please. It's good English. I'll

pronounce it for you in our own language, so's you can

see how it works that way. It goes like—"
"You need not illustrate, your Highness," the Premier

hastened to say. Turning to the Duke, he said coldly:

"I acknowledge the wisdom in your remarks, your Grace,

but—you will pardon me, I am sure—would it not be

better to discuss the conditions privately among ourselves

before taking them up officially?"
"That confounded American has every one hypnotised,"

exploded the Duke. "His influence over this boy is a

menace to our country. He is making on oaf of him—a

slangy, impudent little—"
"Your Grace!" interrupted Baron Dangloss sharply.
"Uncle Jack's all right," declared the Prince, vaguely

realising that a defence should be forthcoming.
"He is, eh?" rasped the exasperated Duke, mopping his

brow.
"He sure is," pronounced the Prince with a finality that

left no room for doubt. They say that fierce little Baron

Dangloss, in striving to suppress a guffaw, choked so

impressively that there was a momentary doubt as to his

ever getting over it alive.
"He is a mountebank—a meddler, that's what he is.

The sooner we come to realise it, the better," exclaimed

the over-heated Duke. "He has greater influence over

our beloved Prince than any one else in the royal household.

He has no business here—none whatsoever. His

presence and his meddling is an affront to the intelligence

of—"
But the Prince had slid down from his pile of books and

planted himself beside him so suddenly that the bitter

words died away on the old man's lips. Robin's face was

white with rage, his little fists were clenched in desperate

anger, his voice was half choked with the tears of indignation.
"You awful old man!" he cried, trembling all over, his

eyes blazing. "Don't you say anything against Uncle

Jack. I'll—I'll banish you—yes, sir—banish you like

my mother fired Count Marlanx out of the country. I

won't let you come back here ever—never. And before

you go I'll have Uncle Jack give you a good licking.

Oh, he can do it all right. I—I hate you!"
The Duke looked down in amazement into the flushed,

writhing face of his little master. For a moment he was

stunned by the vigorous outburst. Then the hard lines

in his face relaxed and a softer expression came into his

eyes—there was something like pride in them, too. The

Duke, be it said, was an honest fighter and a loyal Graustarkian;

he loved his Prince and, therefore, he gloried

in his courage. His own smile of amusement, which

broke in spite of his inordinate vanity, was the sign that

brought relief to the hearts of his scandalised confrères.
"Your Highness does well in defending a friend and

counsellor," he said gently. "I am sorry to have forgotten

myself in your presence. It shall not occur again.

Pray forgive me."
Prince Bobby was still unappeased. "I could have you

beheaded," he said stubbornly. "Couldn't I, Uncle

Caspar?"
Count Halfont gravely informed him that it was not

customary to behead gentlemen except for the most

heinous offences against the Crown.
The Duke of Perse suddenly bent forward and placed

his bony hand upon the unshrinking shoulder of the

Prince, his eyes gleaming kindly, his voice strangely free

from its usual harshness. "You are a splendid little

man, Prince Robin," he said. "I glory in you. I shall not

forget the lesson in loyalty that you have taught me."
Bobby's eyes filled with tears. The genuine humility of

the hard old man touched his tempestuous little heart.
"It's—it's all right, Du—your Grace. I'm sorry I

spoke that way, too."
Baron Dangloss twisted his imperial vigorously. "My

lords, I suggest that we adjourn. The Prince must have

his ride and return in time for the review at one o'clock."
As the Prince strode soberly from the Room of Wrangles,

every eye was upon his sturdy little back and there

was a kindly light in each of them, bar none. The Duke,

following close behind with Halfont, said quietly:
"I love him, Caspar. But I have no love for the man

he loves so much better than he loves any of us. Tullis

is a meddler—but, for Heaven's sake, my friend, don't

let; Bobby know that I have repeated myself."
Later on, the Prince in his khaki riding suit loped gaily

down the broad mountain road toward Ganlook, beside the

black mare which carried John Tullis. Behind them rode

three picked troopers from the House Guard. He had

told Tullis of his vainglorious defence in the antechamber.
"And I told him, Uncle Jack, that you could lick him.

You can, can't you?"
The American's face was clouded for a second; then, to

please the boy, a warm smile succeeded the frown.
"Why, Bobby, you dear little beggar, he could thresh me

with one hand."
"What?" almost shrieked Prince Bobby, utterly dismayed.
"He's a better swordsman than I, don't you see. Gentlemen

over here fight with swords. I know nothing about

duelling. He'd get at me in two thrusts."
"I—I think you'd better take some lessons from Colonel

Quinnox. It won't do to be caught napping."
"I daresay you're right."
"Say, Uncle Jack, when are you going to take me to

the witch's hovel?" The new thought abruptly banished

all else from his eager little brain.
"Some day, soon," said Tullis. "You see, I'm not sure

that she's receiving visitors these days. A witch is a

very arbitrary person. Even princes have to send up

their cards."
"Let's telegraph her," in an inspired tone.
"I'll arrange to go up with you very soon, Bobby. It's

a hard ride through the pass and—and there may be a

lot of goblins up there where the old woman keeps herself."
The witch's hovel was in the mountain across the most

rugged of the canyons, and was to be reached only after

the most hazardous of rides. The old woman of the

hills was an ancient character about whom clung a thousand

spookish traditions, but who, in the opinion of John

Tuilis, was nothing more than a wise fortune-teller and

necromancer who knew every trick in the trade of hoodwinking

the superstitious. He had seen her and he had

been properly impressed. Somehow, he did not like the

thought of taking the Prince to the cabin among the

mists and crags.
"They say she eats boys, now and then," he added, as

if suddenly remembering it.
"Gee! Do you suppose we could get there some day

when she's eating one?"
As they rode back to the Castle after an hour, coming

down through Castle Avenue from the monastery road,

they passed a tall, bronzed young man whom Tullis at

once knew to be an American. He was seated on a big

boulder at the roadside, enjoying the shade, and was

evidently on his way by foot to the Castle gates to watch

the beau monde assembling for the review. At his side

was the fussy, well-known figure of Cook's interpreter,

eagerly pointing out certain important personages to

bun as they passed. Of course, the approach of the

Prince was the excuse for considerable agitation and

fervour on the part of the man from Cook's. He

mounted the boulder and took off his cap to wave it

frantically.
"It's the Prince!" he called out to Truxton King.

"Stand up! Hurray! Long live the Prince!"
Tullis had already lifted his hand in salute to his

countryman, and both had smiled the free, easy smile of

men who know each other by instinct.
The man from Cook's came to grief. He slipped from

his perch on the rock and came floundering to the ground

below, considerably crushed in dignity, but quite intact

in other respects.
The spirited pony that the Prince was riding shied and

reared in quick affright. The boy dropped his crop and

clung valiantly to the reins. A guardsman was at the

pony's head in an instant, and there was no possible

chance for disaster.
Truxton King unbent his long frame, picked up the

riding crop with a deliberateness that astonished the man

from Cook's, strode out into the roadway and handed it

up to the boy in the saddle.
"Thank you," said Prince Bobby.
"Don't mention it," said Truxton King with his most

engaging smile. "No trouble at all."

CHAPTER III
MANY PERSONS IN REVIEW
Truxton King witnessed the review of the garrison.

That in itself was rather a tame exhibition for a man

who had seen the finest troops in all the world. A thousand

earnest looking soldiers, proud of the opportunity

to march before the little Prince—and that was all, so

far as the review was concerned.
But, alluringly provident to the welfare of this narrative,

the red and black uniformed soldiers were not the

only persons on review that balmy day in July. Truxton

King had his first glimpse of the nobility of Graustark.

He changed his mind about going to Vienna on

the Saturday express. A goodly number of men before

him had altered their humble plans for the same reason,

I am reliably informed.
Mr. King saw the court in all its glory, scattered along

the shady Castle Avenue—in carriages, in traps, in

motors and in the saddle. His brain whirled and his

heart leaped under the pressure of a new-found interest

in life. The unexpected oasis loomed up before his eyes

just as he was abandoning all hope in the unprofitable

desert of Romance. He saw green trees and sparkling

rivulets, and he sighed with a new, strange content. No,

on second thoughts, he would not go to Vienna. He

would stay in Edelweiss. He was a disciple of Micawber;

and he was so much younger and fresher than that distinguished

gentleman, that perhaps he was justified in

believing that, in his case, something was bound to "turn

up."
If Truxton King had given up in disgust and fled to

Vienna, this tale would never have come to light. Instead

of being the lively narrative of a young gentleman's

adventures in far-away Graustark, it might have

become a tale of the smart set in New York—for, as you

know, we are bound by tradition to follow the trail laid

down by our hero, no matter which way he elects to fare.

Somewhat dismayed by his narrow escape, he confided

to his friend from Cook's that he could never have forgiven

himself if he had adhered to his resolution to leave

on the following day.
"I didn't know you'd changed your mind, sir," remarked

Mr. Hobbs in surprise.
"Of course you didn't know it," said Truxton. "How

could you? I've just changed it, this instant. I didn't

know it myself two minutes ago. No, sir, Hobbs—or is it

Dobbs? Thanks—no, sir, I'm going to stop here for

a—well, a week or two. Where the dickens do these people

keep themselves? I haven't seen 'em before."
"Oh, they are the nobility—the swells. They don't

hang around the streets like tourists and rubbernecks,

sir," in plain disgust.
"I thought you were an Englishman," observed King,

with a quizzical smile.
"I am, sir. I can't help saying rubbernecks, sir, though

it's a shocking word. It's the only name for them, sir.

That's what the little Prince calls them, too. You see,

it's one form of amusement they provide for him, and I

am supposed to help it along as much as possible. Mr.

Tullis takes him out in the avenue whenever I've got a

party in hand. I telephone up to the Castle that I've

got a crowd and then I drive 'em out to the Park here.

The Prince says he just loves to watch the rubbernecks

go by. It's great fun, sir, for the little lad. He never

misses a party, and you can believe it or not, he has

told me so himself. Yes, sir, the Prince has had more

than one word with me—from time to time." King

looked at the little man's reddish face and saw therein

the signs of exaltation indigenous to a land imperial.
He hesitated for an instant and then remarked, with a

mean impulse to spoil Hobbs's glorification: "I have

dined with the President of the United States."
Hobbs was politely unimpressed. "I've no doubt, sir,"

he said. "I daresay it was an excellent dinner."
King blinked his eyes and then turned them upon the

passing show. He was coming to understand the real

difference between men.
"I say, who is that just passing—the lady in the victoria?"

he asked abruptly.
"That is the Countess Marlanx."
"Whew! I thought she was the queen!"
Hobbs went into details concerning the beautiful

Countess. During the hour and a half of display he

pointed out to King all of the great personages, giving

a Baedeker-like account of their doings from childhood

up, quite satisfying that gentleman's curiosity and involving

his cupidity at the same time.
When, at last, the show was over, Truxton and the

voluble little interpreter, whom he had employed for

the occasion, strolled leisurely back to the heart of the

town. Something had come over King, changing the

quaint old city from a prosaic collection of shops and

thoroughfares into a veritable playground for Cinderellas

and Prince Charmings. The women, to his startled

imagination, had been suddenly transformed from lackadaisical

drudges into radiant personages at whose feet

it would be a pleasure to fall, in whose defence it would be

divine to serve; the men were the cavaliers that had called

to him from the pages of chivalrous tales, ever since the

days of his childhood. Here were knights and ladies

such as he had dreamed of and despaired of ever seeing

outside his dreams.
Hobbs was telling him how every one struggled to provide

amusement for the little Prince at whose court these

almost mythological beings bent the knee. "Every few

days they have a royal troupe of acrobats in the Castle

grounds. Next week Tantora's big circus is to give a

private performance for him. There are Marionettes

and Punch and Judy shows, and all the doings of the

Grand Grignol are beautifully imitated. The royal band

plays every afternoon, and at night some one tells him

stories of the valorous men who occupied the throne before

him. He rides, plays baseball and cricket, swims,

goes shooting—and, you may take it from me, sir, he

is already enjoying fencing lessons with Colonel Quinnox,

chief of the Castle guard. Mr. Tullis, the American, has

charge of his—you might say, his education and entertainment.

They want to make of him a very wonderful

Prince. So they are starting at the bottom. He's quite

a wonderful little chap. What say, sir?"
"I was just going to ask if you know anything about a

young woman who occasionally tends shop for William

Spantz, the armourer."
Hobbs looked interested. "She's quite a beauty, sir, I

give you my word."
"I know that, Hobbs. But who is she?"
"I really can't say, sir. She's his niece, I've heard.

Been here a little over a month. I think she's from

Warsaw."
"Well, I'll say good-bye here. If you've nothing on

for to-morrow we'll visit the Castle grounds and—ahem!—take

a look about the place. Come to the hotel early.

I'm going over to the gun-shop. So long!" As he

crossed the square, his mind full of the beautiful women

he had seen, he was saying to himself in a wild strain of

exhilaration: "I'll bet my head that girl isn't the nobody

she's setting herself up to be. She looks like these I've

just seen. She's got the marks of a lady. You can't

fool me. I'm going to find out who she is and—well,

maybe it won't be so dull here, after all. It looks better

every minute."
He was whistling gaily as he entered the little shop,

ready to give a cheery greeting to old Spantz and to

make him a temporising offer for the broadsword. But

it was not Spantz who stood behind the little counter.

Truxton flushed hotly and jerked off his hat. The girl

smiled.
"I beg pardon," he exclaimed. "I—I'm looking for

Mr. Spantz—I—"
"He is out. Will you wait? He will return in a very

few minutes." Her voice was clear and low, her accent

charming. The smile in her eyes somehow struck him as

sad, even fleeting in its attempt at mirth. As she spoke,

it disappeared altogether and an almost sombre expression

came into her face.
"Thanks. I'll—wait," he said, suddenly embarrassed.

She turned to the window, resuming the wistful, preoccupied

gaze down the avenue. He made pretence of inspecting

the wares on the opposite wall, but covertly

watched her out of the corner of his eye. Perhaps, calculated

he, if she were attired in the gown of one of those

fashionables she might rank with the noblest of them in

beauty and delicacy. Her dark little head was carried

with all the serene pride of a lady of quality; her features

were clear cut, mobile, and absolutely flawless. He

was sure of that: his sly analysis was not as casual as

one might suppose under the circumstances. As a matter

of fact, he found himself having what he afterward

called "a very good look at her." She seemed to have

forgotten his presence. The longer he looked at the

delicate profile, the more fully was he convinced that she

was not all that she pretended. He experienced a thrill

of hope. If she wasn't what she pretended to be, then

surely she must be what he wanted her to be—a lady of

quality. In that case there was a mystery. The thought

restored his temerity.
"Beg pardon," he said, politely sauntering up to the

little counter. He noted that she was taller than he had

thought, and slender. She started and turned toward

him with a quick, diffident smile, her dark eyes filling

with an unspoken apology. "I wanted to have another

look at the broadsword there. May I get it out of the

window, or will you?"
Very quickly—he noticed that she went about it clumsily

despite her supple gracefulness—she withdrew the heavy

weapon from the window and laid it upon the counter.

He was looking at her with a peculiar smile upon his lips.

She flushed painfully.
"I am not—not what you would call an expert," she

said frankly.
"You mean in handling broadswords," he said in his

most suave manner. "It's a cunning little thing, isn't

it?" He picked up the ponderous blade. "I don't wonder

you nearly dropped it on your toes."
"There must have been giants in those days," she said,

a slight shudder passing over her.
"Whoppers," he agreed eagerly. "I've thought somewhat

of buying the old thing. Not to use, of course.

I'm not a giant."
"You're not a pigmy," she supplemented, her eyes

sweeping his long figure comprehensively.
"What's the price?" he asked, his courage faltering

under the cool, impersonal gaze.
"I do not know. My uncle has told you?"
"I—I think he did. But I've got a wretched memory

when it comes to broadswords."
She laughed. "This is such a very old broadsword,

too," she said. "It goes back beyond the memory of

man."
"How does it come that you don't know the price?" he

asked, watching her narrowly. She met his inquiring

look with perfect composure.
"I am quite new at the trade. I hope you will excuse

my ignorance. My uncle will be here in a moment." She

was turning away with an air that convinced King of

one thing: she was a person who, in no sense, had ever

been called upon to serve others.
"So I've heard," he observed. The bait took effect.

She looked up quickly; he was confident that a startled

expression flitted across her face.
"You have heard? What have you heard of me?" she

demanded.
"That you are new at the business," he replied coolly.
"You are a stranger in a strange land, so they say."
"You have been making inquiries?" she asked, disdain

succeeding dismay.
"Tentatively, that's all. Ever since you peeked out of

the window up there and laughed at me. I'm curious,

you see."
She stared at him in silent intensity for a moment.

"That's why I laughed at you. You were very curious."
"Am I so bad as all that?" he lamented.
She ignored the question. "Why should you be interested

in me, sir?"
Mr. King was inspired to fabricate in the interest of

psychical research. "Because I have heard that you are

not the niece of old man Spantz." He watched intently

to catch the effect of the declaration.
She merely stared at him; there was not so much as

the flutter of an eyelid. "You have heard nothing of

the kind," she said coldly.
"Well, I'll confess I haven't," he admitted cheerfully.

"I was experimenting. I'm an amateur Sherlock Holmes.

It pleases me to deduce that you are not related to the

armourer. You don't look the part."
Now she smiled divinely. "And why not, pray? His

sister was my mother."
"In order to establish a line on which to base my calculations,

would you mind telling me who your father

is?" He asked the question with his most appealing

smile—a smile so frankly impudent that she could not

resent it.
"My mother's husband," she replied in the same spirit.
"Well, that is quite a clue!" he exclaimed. "'Pon my

soul, I believe I'm on the right track. Excuse me for

continuing, but is he a count or a duke or just a—"
"My father is dead," she interrupted, without taking

her now serious gaze from his face.
"I beg your pardon," he said at once. "I'm sorry if

I've hurt you."
"My mother is dead. Now can you understand why I

am living here with my uncle? Even an amateur may

rise to that. Now, sir, do you expect to purchase the

sword? If not, I shall replace it in the window."
"That's what I came here for," said he, resenting her

tone and the icy look she gave him.
"I gathered that you came in the capacity of Sherlock

Holmes—or something else." She added the last three

words with unmistakable meaning.
"You mean as a—" he hesitated, flushing.
"You knew I was alone, sir."
"By Jove, you're wrong there. I give you my word,

I didn't. If I'd known it, I'd surely have come in sooner.

There, forgive me. I'm particularly light-headed and

futile to-day, and I hope—Beg pardon?"
She was leaning toward him, her hands on the counter,

a peculiar gleam in her dark eyes—which now, for the

first time, struck him as rather more keen and penetrating

than he had suspected before.
"I simply want to tell you, Mr. King, that unless you

really expect to buy this sword it is not wise in you to

make it an excuse for coming here."
"My dear young lady, I—"
"My uncle has a queer conception of the proprieties.

He may think that you come to see me." A radiant smile

leaped into her face, transforming its strange sombreness

into absolutely impish mirth.
"Well, hang it all, he can't object to that, can he?

Besides, I never buy without haggling," he expostulated,

suddenly exhilarated, he knew not why.
"Don't come in here unless you expect to buy," she

said, serious in an instant. "It isn't the custom in Edelweiss.

Young men may chat with shopgirls all the world

over—but in Edelweiss, no—unless they come to pay

most honourable court to them. My uncle would not

understand."
"I take it, however, that you would understand," he

said boldly.
"I have lived in Vienna, in Paris and in London. But

now I am living in Edelweiss. I have not been a shopgirl

always."
"I can believe that. My deductions are justified."
"Pray forgive me for offering this bit of advice. A

word to the wise. My uncle would close the door in your

face if—if he thought—"
"I see. Well, I'll buy the blooming sword. Anyhow,

that's what I came in for."
"No. You came in because I smiled at you from the

window upstairs. It is my sitting-room."
"Why did you smile? Tell me?" eagerly.
"It was nature asserting itself."
"You mean you just couldn't help it?"
"That's precisely what I mean."
"Not very complimentary, I'd say."
"A smile is ever a compliment, sir."
"I say, do you know you interest me?" he began

warmly, but she put her finger to her lips.
"My uncle is returning. I must not talk to you any

longer." She glanced uneasily out upon the square, and

then hurriedly added, a certain wistfulness in her voice

and eyes. "I couldn't help it to-day. I forgot my

place. But you are the first gentleman I've spoken to

since I came here."
"I—I was afraid you might think I am not a gentleman.

I've been rather fresh."
"I happen to have known many gentlemen. Before I

went into—service, of course." She turned away abruptly,

a sudden shadow crossing her face. Truxton

King exulted. At last he was touching the long-sought

trail of the Golden Girl! Here was Romance! Here

was mystery!
Spantz was crossing the sidewalk. The American

leaned forward and half-whispered: "Just watch me buy

that broadsword. I may, in time, buy out the shop,

piece by piece."
She smiled swiftly. "Let me warn you: don't pay his

price."
"Thanks."
When Spantz entered the door, a moment later, the

girl was gazing listlessly from the window and Truxton

King was leaning against the counter with his back

toward her, his arms folded and a most impatient frown

on his face.
"Hello!" he said gruffly. "I've been waiting ten minutes

for you."
Spantz's black eyes shot from one to the other. "What

do you want?" he demanded sharply. As he dropped his

hat upon a stool near, the door, his glance again darted

from the man to the girl and back again.
"The broadsword. And, say, Mr. Spantz, you might

assume a different tone in addressing me. I'm a customer,

not a beggar."
The girl left the window and walked slowly to the rear

of the shop, passing through the narrow door, without

so much as a glance at King or the old man. Spantz was

silent until she was gone.
"You want the broadsword, eh?" he asked, moderating

his tone considerably. "It's a rare old—"
"I'll give you a hundred dollars-not another cent,"

interrupted King, riot yet over his resentment. There

followed a long and irritating argument, at the conclusion

of which Mr. King became the possessor of the

weapon at his own price. Remembering himself in time,

he fell to admiring some old rings and bracelets in a

cabinet near by, thus paving the way for future visits.
"I'll come in again," he said indifferently.
"But you are leaving to-morrow, sir."
"I've changed my mind."
"You are not going?"
"Not for a few days."
"Then you have discovered something in Edelweiss to

attract you?" grinned the old armourer. "I thought

you might."
"I've had a glimpse of the swells, my good friend."
"It's all the good you'll get of it," said Spantz gruffly.
"I daresay you're right. Clean that sword up a bit for

me, and I'll drop in to-morrow and get it. Here's sixty

gavvos to bind the bargain. The rest on delivery.

Good day, Mr. Spantz."
"Good day, Mr. King."
"How do you happen to know my name?"
Spantz put his hand over his heart and delivered himself

of a most impressive bow. "When so distinguished

a visitor comes to our little city," he said, "we lose no

time in discovering his name. It is a part of our trade,

sir, believe me."
"I'm not so sure that I do believe you," said Truxton

King to himself as he sauntered up the street toward the

Hotel. "The girl knew me, too, now that I come to

think of it. Heigho! By Jove, I do hope I can work

up a little something to interest—Hello!"
Mr. Hobbs, from Cook's, was at his elbow, his eyes

glistening with eagerness.
"I say, old Dangloss is waiting for you at the Regengetz,

sir. Wot's up? Wot you been up to, sir?"
"Up to? Up to, Hobbs?"
"My word, sir, you must have been or he wouldn't be

there to see you."
"Who is Dangloss?"
"Minister of Police—haven't I told you? He's a keen

one, too, take my word for it. He's got Sherlock beat a

mile."
"So have I, Hobbs. I'm not slow at Sherlocking, let

me tell you that. How do you know he's waiting to see

me?"
"I heard him ask for you. And I was there just now

when one of his men came in and told him you were on

your way up from the gunshop down there."
"So they're watching me, eh? 'Gad, this is fine!"
He lost no time in getting to the hotel. A well-remembered,

fierce-looking little man in a white linen suit

was waiting for him on the great piazza.
Baron Jasto Dangloss was a polite man but not to the

point of procrastination. He advanced to meet the

puzzled American, smiling amiably and twirling his imposing

mustachios with neatly gloved fingers.
"I have called, Mr. King, to have a little chat with you

about your father," he said abruptly. He enjoyed the

look of surprise on the young man's face.
"My father?" murmured Truxton, catching his breath.

He was shaking hands with the Baron, all the while

staring blankly into his twinkling, snapping eyes.
"Won't you join me at this table? A julep will not

be bad, eh?" King sat down opposite to him at one of

the piazza tables, in the shade of the great trailing vines.
"Fine," was his only comment.
A waiter took the order and departed. The Baron produced

his cigarette case. King carefully selected one

and tapped its tip on the back of his hand.
"Is—has anything happened to my father?" he asked

quietly. "Bad news?"
"On the contrary, sir, he is quite well. I had a cablegram

from him to-day."
"A cablegram?"
"Yes. I cabled day before yesterday to ask if he could

tell me the whereabouts of his son."
"The deuce you say!"
"He replies that you are in Teheran."
"What is the meaning of this, Baron?"
"It is a habit I have. I make it a practice to keep in

touch with the movements of our guests."
"I see. You want to know all about me; why I'm here,

where I came from, and all that. Well, I'm ready for

the 'sweat box.'"
"Pray do not take offence. It is my rule. It would not

be altered if the King of England came. Ah, here are

the juleps. Quick service, eh?"
"Remarkably so, due to your powers of persuasion, I

fancy."
"I really ordered them a few minutes before you

arrived. You see, I was quite certain you'd have one.

You take one about this hour every day."
"By Jove, you have been watching me!" cried Truxton

delightedly.
"What are you doing in Edelweiss, Mr. King?" asked

the Baron abruptly but not peremptorily.
"Sight-seeing and in search of adventure," was the

prompt response.
"I fancied as much. You've seen quite a bit of the

world since you left home two years ago, on the twenty-seventh

of September."
"By Jove!"
"Been to South Africa, Asia and—South America—to

say nothing of Europe. That must have been an

exciting little episode in South America."
"You don't mean to say—"
"Oh, I know all about your participation in the revolution

down there. You were a captain, I understand,

during the three weeks of disturbance. Splendid! For

the fun of the thing, I suppose. Well, I like it in you.

I should have done it myself. And you got out of the

country just in time, if I remember rightly. There was

a price placed on your head by the distressed government.

I imagine they would have shot you if they could

have caught you—as they did the others." The old

man chuckled. "You don't expect to return to South

America, do you? The price is still offered, you know."
King was glaring at him in sheer wonder. Here was

an episode in his life that he fondly hoped might never

come to light; he knew how it would disturb his mother.

And this foxy old fellow away off here in Graustark

knew all about it.
"Well, you're a wonder!" in pure admiration.
"An appreciated compliment, I assure you. This is all

in the way of letting you know that we have found out

something concerning your movements. Now, to come

down to the present. You expected to leave to-morrow.

Why are you staying over?"
"Baron, I leave that to your own distinguished powers

of deduction," said Truxton gently. He took a long

pull at the straw, watching the other's face as he did so.

The Baron smiled.
"You have found the young lady to be very attractive,"

observed the Baron. "Where have you known her before?"
"I beg pardon?"
"It is not unusual for a young man in search of adventure

to follow the lady of his choice from place to

place. She came but recently, I recall."
"You think I knew her before and followed her to Edelweiss?"
"I am not quite sure whether you have been in Warsaw

lately. There is a gap in your movements that I can't

account for."
King became serious at once. He saw that it was best

to be frank with this keen old man.
"Baron Dangloss, I don't know just what you are

driving at, but I'll set you straight so far as I'm concerned.

I never saw that girl until the day before yesterday.

I never spoke to her until to-day."
"She smiled on you quite familiarly from her window

casement yesterday," said Dangloss coolly.
"She laughed at me, to be perfectly candid. But what's

all this about? Who is she? What's the game? I don't

mind confessing that I have a feeling she is not what she

claims to be, but that's as far as I've got."
Dangloss studied the young man's face for a moment

and then came to a sudden decision. He leaned forward

and smiled sourly.
"Take my advice: do not play with fire," he said

enigmatically.
"You—you mean she's a dangerous person? I can't

believe that, Baron."
"She has dangerous friends out in the world. I don't

mean to say she will cause you any trouble here—but

there is a hereafter. Mind you, I'm not saying she isn't

a good girl, or even an adventuress. On the contrary,

she comes of an excellent family—in fact, there were

noblemen among them a generation or two ago. You

know her name?"
"No. I say, this is getting interesting!" He was

beaming.
"She is Olga Platanova. Her mother was married in

this city twenty-five years ago to Professor Platanova of

Warsaw. The Professor was executed last year for conspiracy.

He was one of the leaders of a great revolutionary

movement in Poland. They were virtually anarchists,

as you have come to place them in America.

This girl, Olga, was his secretary. His death almost

killed her. But that is not all. She had a sweetheart

up to fifteen months ago. He was a prince of the royal

blood. He would have married her in spite of the difference

in their stations had it not been for the intervention

of the Crown that she and her kind hate so well.

The young man's powerful relatives took a hand in the

affair. He was compelled to marry a scrawny little duchess,

and Olga was warned that if she attempted to entice

him away from his wife she would be punished. She

did not attempt it, because she is a virtuous girl—of

that I am sure. But she hates them all—oh, how she

hates them! Her uncle, Spantz, offered her a home.

She came here a month ago, broken-spirited and sick.

So far, she has been exceedingly respectful to our laws.

It is not that we fear anything from her; but that we

are obliged to watch her for the benefit of our big

brothers across the border. Now you know why I advised

you to let the fire alone."
King was silent for a moment, turning something over

in his head.
"Baron, are you sure that she is a Red?"
"Quite. She attended their councils."
"She doesn't look it, 'pon my word. I thought they

were the scum of the earth."
"The kind you have in America are. But over here—oh,

well, we never can tell."
"I don't mind saying she interests me. She's pretty—and

I have an idea she's clever. Baron, let me understand

you. Do you mean that this is a polite way of

commanding me to have nothing to do with her?"
"You put it broadly. In the first place, I am quite

sure she will have nothing to do with you. She loved

the husband of the scrawny duchess. You, my good

friend, handsome as you are, cannot interest her, believe me."
"I daresay you're right," glumly.
"I am merely warning you. Young men of your age

and temperament sometimes let their fancies lead them

into desperate predicaments. I've no doubt you can take

care of yourself, but—" he paused, as if very much in

doubt.
"I'm much obliged. And I'll keep my eyes well opened.

I suppose there's no harm in my going to the shop to

look at a lot of rings and knick-knacks he has for sale?"
"Not in the least. Confine yourself to knick-knacks,

that's all."
"Isn't Spantz above suspicion?"
"No one is in my little world. By the way, I am very

fond of your father. He is a most excellent gentleman

and a splendid shot."
Truxton stared harder than ever. "What's that?"
"I know him quite well. Hunted wild boars with him

five years ago in Germany. And your sister! She was

a beautiful young girl. They were at Carlsbad at the

time. Was she quite well when you last heard?"
"She was," was all that the wondering brother could

say.
"Well, come in and see me at the tower. I am there in

the mornings. Come as a caller, not as a prisoner,

that's all." The Baron cackled at his little jest. "Au

revoir! Till we meet again." They were shaking hands

in the friendliest manner. "Oh, by the way, you were

good enough to change your mind to-day about the

personal attractiveness of our ladies. Permit me to observe,

in return, that not a few of our most distinguished

beauties were good enough to make inquiries as to your

identity."
He left the American standing at the head of the steps,

gazing after his retreating figure with a look of admiration

in his eyes.
Truxton fared forth into the streets that night with a

greater zest in life than he had ever known before. Some

thing whispered insistently to his fancy that dreariness

was a thing of the past; he did not have to whistle to

keep up his spirits. They were soaring of their own

accord.
He did not know, however, that a person from the

secret service was watching his every movement. Nor,

on the other hand, is it at all likely that the secret service

operative was aware that he was not the only shadower

of the blithe young stranger.
A man with a limp cigarette between his lips was never

far from the side of the American—a man who had

stopped to pass the time of day with William Spantz,

and who, from that hour was not to let the young man

out of his sight until another relieved him of the task.

CHAPTER IV
TRUXTON TRESPASSES
He went to bed that night, tired and happy. To his revived

spirits and his new attitude toward life in its present

state, the city had suddenly turned gay and vivacious.

Twice during the evening he passed Spantz's

shop. It was dark, upstairs and down. He wondered

if the unhappy Olga was looking at him from behind the

darkened shutters. But even if she were not—la, la!

He was having a good time! He was gay! He was

seeing pretty women in the cafés and the gardens! Well,

well, he would see her to-morrow—after that he would

give proper heed to the Baron's warning! An anarchist's

daughter!
He slept well, too, with never a thought of the Saturday

express which he had lain awake on other nights to

lament and anathematise. Bright and early in the morning

he was astir. Somehow he felt he had been sleeping

too much of late.
There was a sparkle in his eyes as he struck out across

town after breakfast. He burst in upon Mr. Hobbs at

Cook's.
"Say, Hobbs, how about the Castle to-day—in an hour,

say? Can you take a party of one rubbernecking this

A.M.? I like you, Hobbs. You are the best interpreter

of English I've ever seen. I can't help understanding

you, no matter how hard I try not to. I want you to

get me into the Castle grounds to-day and show me

where the duchesses dawdle and the countesses cavort.

I'm ashamed to say it, Hobbs, but since yesterday I've

quite lost interest in the middle classes and the component

parts thereof. I have suddenly acquired a thirst

for champagne—in other words, I have a hankering for

the nobility. Catch the idea? Good! Then you'll guide

me into the land of the fairies? At ten?"
"I'll take you to the Castle grounds, Mr. King, all

right enough, sir, and I'll tell you all the things of interest,

but I'll be 'anged, sir, if I've got the blooming

nerve to introduce you to the first ladies of the land.

That's more than I can ever 'ope to do, sir, and—"
"Lord bless you, Hobbs, don't look so depressed. I

don't ask you to present me at court. I just want to

look at the lilacs and the gargoyles. That's as far as I

expect to carry my invasion of the dream world."
"Of course, sir, you understand there are certain parts

of the Park not open to the public. The grotto and the

playgrounds and the Basin of Venus—"
"I'll not trespass, so don't fidget, Hobbs. I'll be here

for you at ten."
Mr. Hobbs looked after the vigorous, happy figure as

it swung down the street, and shook his head mournfully.

Turning to the solitary clerk who dawdled behind the

cashier's desk he remarked with more feeling than was

his wont:
"He's just the kind of chap to get me into no end of

trouble if I give 'im rope enough. Take it from me,

Stokes, I'll have my hands full of 'im up there this morning.

He's charged like a soda bottle; and you never

know wot's going to happen unless you handle a soda

bottle very careful-like."
Truxton hurried to the square and across it to the

shop of the armourer, not forgetting, however, to look

about in some anxiety for the excellent Dangloss, who

might, for all he knew, be snooping in the neighbourhood.

Spantz was at the rear of the shop, talking to a

customer. The girl was behind the counter, dressed for

the street.
She came quickly out to him, a disturbed expression in

her face. As he doffed his hat, the smile left his lips;

he saw that she had been weeping.
"You must not come here, Mr. King," she said hurriedly,

in low tones. "Take your broadsword this morning

and—please, for my sake, do not come again. I—I

may not explain why I am asking you to do this, but I

mean it for your good, more than for my own. My

uncle will be out in a moment. He knows you are here.

He is listening now to catch what I am saying to you.

Smile, please, or he will suspect—"
"See here," demanded King, smiling, but very much in

earnest, "what's up? You've been crying. What's he

been doing or saying to you? I'll give him a—"
"No, no! Be sensible! It is nothing in which you

could possibly take a hand. I don't know you, Mr.

King, but I am in earnest when I say that it is not safe

for you to come here, ostensibly to buy. It is too easily

seen through—it is—"
"Just a minute, please," he interrupted. "I've heard

your story from Baron Dangloss. It has appealed to

me. You are not happy. Are you in trouble? Do you

need friends, Miss Platanova?"
"It is because you would be a friend that I ask you to

stay away. You cannot be my friend. Pray do not

consider me bold for assuming so much. But I know—I

know men, Mr. King. The Baron has told you all about

me?" She smiled sadly. "Alas, he has only told you

what he knows. But it should be sufficient. There is no

place in my life for you or any one else. There never

can be. So, you see, you may not develop your romance

with me as the foundation. Oh, I've heard of your quest

of adventure. I like you for it. I had an imagination

myself, once on a time. I loved the fairy books and the

love tales. But not now-not now. There is no romance

for me. Nothing but grave reality. Do not question

me! I can say no more. Now I must be gone. I—I

have warned you. Do not come again!"
"Thanks, for the warning," he said quietly. "But I

expect to come in occasionally, just the same. You've

taken the wrong tack by trying to frighten me off. You

see, Miss Platanova, I'm actually looking for something

dangerous—if that's what you mean."
"That isn't all, believe me," she pleaded. "You can

gain nothing by coming. You know who I am. I cannot

be a friend—not even an acquaintance to you, Mr.

King. Good-bye! Please do not come again!"
She slipped into the street and was gone. King stood

in the doorway, looking after her, a puzzled gleam in his

eyes. Old Spantz was coming up from the rear, followed

by his customer.
"Queer," thought the American. "She's changed her

tactics rather suddenly. Smiled at me in the beginning

and now cries a bit because I'm trying to return the

compliment. Well, by the Lord Harry, she shan't scare

me off like—Hello, Mr. Spantz! Good morning! I'm

here for the sword."
The old man glared at him in unmistakable displeasure.

Truxton began counting out his money. The customer,

a swarthy fellow, passed out of the door, turning to

glance intently at the young man. A meaning look and

a sly nod passed between him and Spantz. The man

halted at the corner below and, later on, followed King

to Cook's office, afterward to the Castle gates, outside

of which he waited until his quarry reappeared. Until

King went to bed late that night this swarthy fellow

was close at his heels, always keeping well out of sight

himself.
"I'll come in soon to look at those rings," said King,

placing the notes on the counter. Spantz merely nodded,

raked in the bills without counting them, and passed the

sword over to the purchaser.
"Very good, sir," he growled after a moment.
"I hate to carry this awful thing through the streets,"

said King, looking at the huge weapon with despairing

eye. Inwardly, he was cursing himself for his extravagance

and cupidity.
"It belongs to you, my friend. Take it or leave it."
"I'll take it," said Truxton, smiling indulgently. With

that he picked up the weapon and stalked away.
A few minutes later he was on his way to the Castle

grounds, accompanied by the short-legged Mr. Hobbs,

who, from time to time, was forced to remove his tight-fitting

cap to mop a hot, exasperated brow, so swift was

the pace set by long-legs. The broadsword reposed

calmly on a desk under the nose of a properly impressed

young person named Stokes, cashier.
Hobbs led him through the great Park gates and up

to the lodge of Jacob Fraasch, the venerable high steward

of the grounds. Here, to King's utter disgust, he was

booked as a plain Cook's tourist and mechanically advised

to pay strict attention to the rules which would be

explained to him by the guide.
"Cook's tourist, eh?" muttered King wrathfully as they

ambled down the shady path together. He looked with

disparaging eye upon the plain little chap beside him.
"It's no disgrace," growled Hobbs, redder than ever.

"You're inside the grounds and you've got to obey the

rules, same as any tourist. Right this way, sir; we'll

take a turn just inside the wall. Now, on your left,

ladies and—ahem!—I should say—ahem!—sir, you may

see the first turret ever built on the wall. It is over four

hundred years old. On the right, we have—"
"See here, Hobbs," said King, stopping short, "I'm

damned if I'll let you lecture me as if I were a gang of

hayseeds from Oklahoma."
"Very good, sir. No offence. I quite forgot, sir."
"Just tell me—don't lecture."
For three-quarters of an hour they wandered through

the spacious grounds, never drawing closer to the Castle

than permitted by the restrictions; always coming up to

the broad driveway which marked the border line, never

passing it. The gorgeous beauty of this historic old

park, so full of traditions and the lore of centuries,

wrought strange fancies and bold inclinations in the head

of the audacious visitor. He felt the bonds of restraint;

he resented the irksome chains of convention; he murmured

against the laws that said he should not step

across the granite road into the cool forbidden world beyond—the

world of kings. Hobbs knew he was doomed

to have rebellion on his hands before long; he could see

it coming.
"When we've seen the royal stables, we'll have seen

everything of any consequence," he hastened to say.

"Then we'll leave by the upper gates and—"
"Hobbs, this is all very beautiful and very grand and

very slow," said King, stopping to lean against the

moss-covered wall that encircled the park within a park:

the grounds adjoining the grotto. "Can't I hop over

this wall and take a peep into the grotto?"
"By no means," cried Hobbs, horrified. "That, sir, is

the most proscribed spot, next to the Castle itself. You

can't go in there."
King looked over the low wall. The prospect was

alluring. The pool, the trickling rivulets, the mossy

banks, the dense shadows: it was maddening to think he

could not enter!
"I wouldn't be in there a minute," he argued. "And

I might catch a glimpse of a dream-lady. Now, I say,

Hobbs, here's a low place. I could jump—"
"Mr. King, if you do that I am ruined forever. I am

trusted by the steward. He would cut off all my privileges—"

Hobbs could go no further. He was prematurely

aghast. Something told him that Mr. King

would hop over the wall.
"Just this once, Hobbs," pleaded his charge. "No one

will know."
"For the love of Moses, sir, I—" Hobbs began to wail.

Then he groaned in dismal horror. King had lightly

vaulted the wall and was grinning back at him from the

sacred precincts—from the playground of princesses.
"Go and report me, Hobbs, there's a good fellow. Tell

the guards I wouldn't obey. That will let you out, my

boy, and I'll do the rest. For Heaven's sake, Hobbs,

don't burst! You'll explode sure if you hold in like that

much longer. I'll be back in a minute."
He strode off across the bright green turf toward the

source of all this enchantment, leaving poor Mr. Hobbs

braced against the wall, weak-kneed and helpless. If he

heard the frantic, though subdued, whistles and the

agonized "hi!" of the man from Cook's a minute or two

later, he gave no heed to the warning. A glimpse behind

might have shown him the error of his ways, reflected in

the disappearance of Hobbs's head below the top of the

wall. But he was looking ahead, drinking in the forbidden

beauties of this fascinating little nook of nature.
Never in all his wanderings had he looked upon a more

inviting spot than this. He came to the edge of the

deep blue pool, above which could be seen the entrance to

the Grotto. Little rivulets danced down through the

crannies in the rocks and leaped joyously into the tree-shaded

pool. Below and to the right were the famed

Basins of Venus, shimmering in the sunlight, flanked by

trees and banks of the softest green. On their surface

swam the great black swans he had heard so much about.

Through a wide rift in the trees he could see the great,

grey Castle, half a mile away, towering against the dense

greens of the nearby mountain. The picture took his

breath away. He forgot Hobbs. He forgot that he was;

trespassing. Here, at last, was the Graustark he had

seen in his dreams, had come to feel in his imagination.
Regardless of surroundings or consequences, he sat

down upon the nearest stone bench, and removed his hat.

He was hot and tired and the air was cool. He would

drink it in as if it were an ambrosial nectar in—and,

moreover, he would also enjoy a cigarette. Carefully he

refrained from throwing the burnt-out match into the

pool below: even such as he could feel that it might be

desecration. As he leaned back with a sigh of exquisite

ease and a splendid exhalation of Turkish smoke, a

small, imperious voice from somewhere behind broke in

upon his primary reflections.
"What are you doing in here?" demanded the voice.
Truxton, conscious of guilt, whirled with as much consternation

as if he had been accosted by a voice of

thunder. He beheld a very small boy standing at the

top of the knoll above him, not thirty feet away. His

face was quite as dirty as any small boy's should be at

that time of day, and his curly brown hair looked as if

it had not been combed since the day before. His firm

little legs, in half hose and presumably white knickers,

were spread apart and his hands were in his pockets.


King recognised him at once, and looked about uneasily

for the attendants whom he knew should be near. It is

safe to say that he came to his feet and bowed deeply,

even in humility.
"I am resting, your Highness," he said meekly.
"Don't you know any better than to come in here?" demanded

the Prince. Truxton turned very red.
"I am sorry. I'll go at once."
"Oh, I'm not going to put you out," hastily exclaimed

the Prince, coming down the slope. "But you are old

enough to know better. The guards might shoot you if

they caught you here." He came quite close to the trespasser.

King saw the scratch on his nose. "Oh, I know

you now. You are the gentleman who picked up my

crop yesterday. You are an American." A friendly

smile illumined his face.
"Yes, a lonely American," with an attempt at the

pathetic.
"Where's your home at?"
"New York. Quite a distance from here."
"You ever been in Central Park?"
"A thousand times. It isn't as nice as this one."
"It's got amilies—no, I don't mean that," supplemented

the Prince, flushing painfully. "I mean—an-i-muls,"

very deliberately. "Our park has no elephunts or taggers.

When I get big I'm going to set out a few in the

park. They'll grow, all right."
"I've shot elephants and tigers in the jungle," said

Truxton. "I tell you they're no fun when they get

after you, wild. If I were you I'd set 'em out in cages."
"P'raps I will." The Prince seemed very thoughtful.
"Won't you sit down, your Highness?"
The youngster looked cautiously about. "Say, do

you ever go fishing?" he demanded eagerly.
"Occasionally."
"You won't give me away, will you?" with a warning

frown. "Don't you tell Jacob Fraasch. He's the

steward. I—I know a fine place to fish. Would you

mind coming along? Look out, please! You're awful

big and they'll see you. I don't know what they'd do

to us if they ketched us. It would be dreadful. Would

you mind sneaking, mister? Make yourself little.

Right up this way."
The Prince led the way up the bank, followed by the

amused American, who stooped so admirably that the

boy, looking back, whispered that it was "just fine."

At the top of the knoll, the Prince turned into a little

shrub-lined path leading down to the banks of the pool

almost directly below the rocky face of the grotto.
"Don't be afraid," he whispered to his new friend. "It

ain't very deep, if you should slip in. But you'd scare

the fish away. Gee, it's a great place to catch 'em.

They're all red, too. D'you ever see red fish?"
Truxton started. This was no place for him! The

Prince had a right to poach on his own preserves, but

a grown man to be caught in the act of landing the

royal goldfish was not to be thought of. He hung

back.
"I'm afraid I won't have time, your Highness. A friend

is waiting for me back there. He—"
"It's right here," pleaded the Prince. "Please stop

a moment. I—I don't know how to put the bait on the

pin. I just want to catch a couple. They won't bite

unless there's worms on the hook. I tried 'em. Look

at 'em! Goodness, there's lots of 'em. Nobody can

see us here. Please, mister, fix a worm for me."
The man sat down behind a bush and laughed joyously.

The eager, appealing look in the lad's eyes went

to his heart. What was a goldfish or two? A fish has

no feeling—not even a goldfish. There was no resisting

the boyish eagerness.
"Why, you're a real boy, after all. I thought being

a prince might have spoiled you," he said.
"Uncle Jack says I can always be a prince, but I'll

soon get over being a boy," said Prince Bobby sagely.

"You will fix it, won't you?"
King nodded, conscienceless now. The Prince scurried

behind a big rock and reappeared at once with a willow

branch from the end of which dangled a piece of thread.

A bent pin occupied the chief end in view. He unceremoniously

shoved the branch into the hands of his confederate,

and then produced from one of his pockets a

silver cigarette box, which he gingerly opened to reveal

to the gaze a conglomerate mass of angle worms

and grubs.
"A fellow gets awful dirty digging for worms, doesn't

he?" he pronounced.
"I should say so," agreed the big boy. "Whose cigarette

case is this?"
"Uncle Caspar's—I mean Count Halfont's. He's got

another, so he won't miss this one. I'm going to leave

some worms in it when I put it back in his desk. He'll

think the fairies did it. Do you believe in fairies?"
"Certainly, Peter," said Truxton, engaged in impaling

a stubborn worm.
"My name isn't Peter," said the Prince coldly.
"I was thinking of Peter Pan. Ever hear of him?"
"No. Say, you mustn't talk or you'll scare 'em away.

Is it fixed?" He took the branch and gingerly dropped

the hook into the dancing pool. In less time than it

requires to tell it he had a nibble, a bite and a catch.

There never was a boy so excited as he when the scarlet

nibbler flew into the shrubbery above; he gasped with

glee. Truxton recovered the catch from the bushes and

coolly detached the truculent pin.
"I'll have 'em for dinner," announced the Prince.
"Are you going to catch a mess?" queried the man,

appalled.
"Sure," said Bobby, casting again with a resolute

splash.
"Are you not afraid they'll get onto you if you take

them to the Castle?" asked the other diplomatically.

"Goldfish are a dead give-away."
"Nobody will scold 'cept Uncle Jack, and he won't

know about it. He's prob'ly gone away by this time."

King noticed that his lip trembled suddenly.
"Gone away?"
"Yes. He was banished this morning right after

breakfast." The announcement began with a tremor

but ended with imperial firmness.
"Great Scott!" gasped the other, genuinely shocked.
"I banished him," said the Prince ruefully. "But," with

a fine smile, "I don't think he'll go. He never does. See

my sign up there?" He pointed to the rocks near the

grotto. "I did it with Hugo's shoe blacking."
A placard containing the important announcement,

"NO FISHING ALOUD" stared down at the poachers

from a tree trunk above. There was nothing very peremptory

in its appearance, but its designer was sufficiently

impressed by the craftiness it contained.
"I put it up so's people wouldn't think anybody—not

even me—would dare to fish here. Oh, look!" The

second of his ruddy mess was flopping in the grass.

Again Truxton thought of Mr. Hobbs, this time with

anxious glances in all directions.
"Where do they think you are, your Highness?"
"Out walking with my aunt. Only she met Count Vos

Engo, and while they were talking I made a sneak—I

mean, I stole away."
"Then they'll be searching for you in all parts of the—"

began Truxton, coming to his feet. "I really must

be going. Please excuse me, your—"
"Oh, don't go! I'll not let 'em do anything to you,"

said the Prince staunchly. "I like Americans better than

anybody else," he went on with deft persuasiveness.

"They ain't—aren't afraid of anything. They're not

cowards."
Truxton sat down at once. He could not turn tail in

the face of such an exalted opinion.
"I'm not supposed to ever go out alone," went on the

Prince confidentially. "You see, they're going to blow

me up if they get a chance."
"Blow you up?"
"Haven't you heard about it? With dynamite bums—bombs.

Yes, sir! That's the way they do to all

princes." He was quite unconcerned. Truxton's look

of horror diminished. No doubt it was a subterfuge

employed to secure princely obedience, very much as the

common little boy is brought to time by mention of the

ubiquitous bogie man.
"That's too bad," commiserated Truxton, baiting the

pin once more.
"It's old Count Marlanx. He's going to blow me up.

He hated my mother and my father, so I guess he hates

me. He's turrible, Uncle Caspar says."
King was very thoughtful for a moment. Something

vivid yet fleeting had shot through his brain—something

that he tried to catch and analyse, but it was

gone before he could grasp its significance. He looked

with new interest upon this serene, lovable little chap,

who was growing up, like all princes, in the shadow of

disaster.
Suddenly the fisherman's quick little ears caught a

sound that caused him to reveal a no-uncertain agitation.

He dropped his rod incontinently and crawled to

the opening in the shrubbery, peering with alarmed eyes

down the path along the bank.
"What is it? A dynamiter?" demanded Truxton uneasily.
"Worse'n that," whispered his royal Highness. "It's

Aunt Loraine. Gee!" To King's utter dismay, the

Prince scuttled for the underbrush.
"Here!" he called in consternation. The Prince

stopped, shamefaced on the instant. "I thought you

were going to protect me."
"I shall," affirmed Bobby, manfully resuming his

ground. "She's coming up the path. Don't run," he

exclaimed scornfully, as Truxton started for the rocks.

"She can't hurt you. She's only a girl."
"All right. I won't run," said the big culprit, who

wished he had the power to fly.
"And there's Saffo and Cors over there watching us,

too. We're caught. I'm sorry, mister."
On the opposite bank of the pool stood two rigid members

of the Royal Guard, intently watching the fishers.

King was somewhat disturbed by the fact that their

rifles were in a position to be used at an instant's notice.

He felt himself turning pale as he thought of what

might have happened if he had taken to flight.
A young lady in a rajah silk gown, a flimsy panama

hat tilted well over her nose, with a red feather that

stood erect as if always in a state of surprise, turned

the bushes and came to a stop almost at King's elbow.

He had time to note, in his confusion, that she was about

shoulder-high alongside him, and that she was staring

up into his face with amazed grey eyes. Afterward

he was to realise that she was amazingly pretty, that

her teeth were very white and even, that her eyes were

the most beautiful and expressive he had ever seen, that

she was slender and imperious, and that there were dimples

in her checks so fascinating that he could not

gather sufficient strength of purpose to withdraw his

gaze from them. Of course, he did not see them at the

outset: she was not smiling, so how could he?
The Prince came to the rescue. "This is my Aunt

Loraine, Mr.—Mr.—" he swallowed hard and looked

helpless.
"King," supplied Truxton, "Truxton King, your

Highness." Then with all the courage he could produce,

he said to the beautiful lady: "I'm as guilty as

he. See!" He pointed ruefully to the four goldfish,

which he had strung upon wire grass and dropped into

the edge of the pool.
She did not smile. Indeed, she gave him a very severe

look. "How cruel!" she murmured. "Bobby, you deserve

a sound spanking. You are a very naughty little

boy." She spoke rapidly in French.
"He put the bait on," said Bobby, also in French.

Here was treachery!
Truxton delivered himself of some French. "Oh, I

say, your Highness, you said you'd pardon me if I were

caught."
"I can't pardon you until you are found guilty," said

the Prince in English.
"Please put those poor little things back in the pool,

Mr. King," said the lady in perfect English.
"Gladly—with the Prince's permission," said King,

also in English. The Prince looked glum, but interposed

no imperial objection. Instead he suddenly shoved the

cigarette box under the nose of his dainty relative, who

at that unpropitious instant stooped over to watch

King's awkward attempt to release the fishes.
"Look at the worms," said the Prince engagingly,

opening the box with a snap.
"Oh!" cried the young lady, starting back. "Throw

them away! the horned things!"
"Oh, they can't bite," scoffed the Prince. "See! I'm

not afraid of 'em. Look at this one." He held up a

wriggler and she fled to the rock. She happened to

glance at Truxton's averted face and was conscious of

a broad grin; whereupon she laughed in the quick staccato

of embarrassment.
It must be confessed that King's composure was sorely

disturbed. In the first place, he had been caught in a

most reprehensible act, and in the second place, he was

not quite sure that the Prince could save him from

ignominious expulsion under the very eyes—and perhaps

direction—of this trim and attractive member of

the royal household. He found himself blundering

foolishly with the fishes and wondering whether she was

a duchess or just a plain countess. Even a regal personage

might jump at the sight of angle worms, he reflected.
He glanced up, to find her studying him, plainly perplexed.
"I just wondered in here," he began guiltily. "The

Prince captured me down there by the big tree."
"Did you say your name is Truxton King?" she

asked somewhat sceptically.
"Yes, your—yes, ma'am," he replied. "Of New York."
"Your father is Mr. Emerson King? Are you the

brother of Adele King?"
Truxton stared. "Have you been interviewing the

police?" he asked before he thought.
"The police? What have you been doing?" she cried,

her eyes narrowing.
"Most everything. The police know all about me.

I'm a spotted character. I thought perhaps they had

told you about me."
"I asked if you were Adele's brother."
"I am."
"I've heard her speak of her brother Truxton. She

said you were in South America."
He stared the harder. Could he believe his ears?
She was regarding him with cool, speculative interest.

"I wonder if you are he?"
"I think I am," he said, but doubtfully. "Please pardon

my amazement. Perhaps I'm dreaming. At any

rate, I'm dazed."
"We were in the convent together for two years. Now

that I observe you closely, you do resemble her. We

were very good friends, she and I."
"Then you'll intercede for me?" he urged, with a

fervent glance in the direction of the wall.
She smiled joyously. He realised then and there that

he had never seen such beautiful teeth, nor any creature

so radiantly beautiful, for that matter.
"More than that," she said, "I shall assist you to

escape. Come!"
He followed her through the shrubbery, his heart

pounding violently. The Prince, who trotted on ahead,

had mentioned a Count. Was she married? Was she

of the royal blood? What extraordinary fate had made

her the friend of his sister? He looked back and saw

the two guardsmen crossing the bridge below, their eyes

still upon him.
"It's very good of you," he said. She glanced back at

him, a quaint smile in her eyes.
"For Adele's sake, if you please. Trespassing is a

very serious offence here. How did you get in?"
"I hopped in, over the wall."
"I'd suggest that you do not hop out again. Hopping

over the walls is not looked upon with favour by the

guards."
He recalled the distressed Mr. Hobbs. "The man

from Cook's tried to restrain me," he said in proper

spirit. "He was very much upset."
"I dare say. You are a Cook's tourist, I see. How

very interesting! Bobby, Uncle Jack is waiting to take

you to see the trained dogs at the eastern gate."
The Prince gave a whoop of joy, but instantly regained

his dignity.
"I can't go, auntie, until I've seen him safe outside

the walls," he said firmly. "I said I would."
They came to the little gate and passed through, into

a winding path that soon brought them to a wide, main-travelled

avenue. A light broke in upon Truxton's mind.

He had it! This was the wonderful Countess Marlanx!

No sooner had he come to that decision than he was

forced to abandon it. The Countess's name was

Ingomede and she already had been pointed out to him.
"I suppose I shall have to recall Uncle Jack from

exile," he heard the Prince saying to the beautiful lady.

Truxton decided that she was not more than twenty-two.

But they married very young in these queer old countries—especially

if they happened to be princes or

princesses. He wanted to talk, to ask questions, to proclaim

his wonder, but discreetly resolved that it was best

to hold his tongue. He was by no means sure of himself.
Be that as it may, he was filled with a strange rejoicing.

Here was a woman with whom he was as sure to fall in

love as he was sure that the sun shone. He liked the

thought of it. Now he appreciated the distinction between

the Olga Platanova type and that which represented

the blood of kings. There was a difference!

Here was the true Patrician!
The Castle suddenly loomed up before them—grey and

frowning, not more than three hundred yards away.

He was possessed of a wild desire to walk straight into

the grim old place and proclaim himself the feudal

owner, seizing everything as his own—particularly the

young woman in the rajah silk. People were strolling

in the shady grounds. He felt the instant infection of

happy indolence, the call to luxury. Men in gay uniforms

and men in cool flannels; women in the prettiest

and daintiest of frocks—all basking in the playtime of

life, unmindful of the toil that fell to the Sons of

Martha out in the sordid world.
"Do you think you can find your man from Cook's?"

she asked.
"Unless he has gone and jumped into the river, your—madam.

In any event, I think I may safely find my

way out. I shall not trouble you to go any farther.

Thank you for overlooking my indiscretion. Thank

you, my dear little Prince, for the happiest experience

of my life. I shall never forget this hour." He looked

boldly into her eyes, and not at the Prince. "Have you

ever been in New York?" he asked abruptly.
He was not at all sure whether the look she gave him

was one of astonishment or resentment. At any rate,

it was a quick glance, followed by the palpable suppression

of words that first came to her lips, and the substitution

of a very polite:
"Yes, and I love it." He beamed. The smile that

came into her eyes escaped him. If he could have seen

it, his bewilderment; would have been sadly increased.
"Say!" whispered the Prince, dropping back as if to

impart a grave secret. "See that man over there by the

fountain, Mr. King?"
"Bobby!" cried the lady sharply. "Good-bye, Mr.

King. Remember me to your sister when you write.

She—"
"That's Aunt Loraine's beau," announced the Prince.
"That's Count Eric Vos Engo." Truxton's look turned

to one of interest at once. The man designated was a

slight, swarthy fellow in the uniform of a colonel. He

did not appear to be particularly happy at the moment.
The American observed the lady's dainty ears. They

had turned a delicate pink.
"May I ask who—" began Truxton timidly.
"She will know if you merely call me Loraine."
"So long," said the Prince.
They parted company at once, the Prince and the

lady in the rajah silk going toward the Castle, King

toward the gates, somewhat dazed and by no means

sure of his senses. He came down to earth after he

had marched along on air for some distance, so to speak,

and found himself deciding that she was a duchess here,

but Loraine at school. What a wonderful place a

girl's school must be! And his sister knew her—knew a

lady of high degree!
"Hobbs!" he called, catching sight of a dejected figure

in front of the chief steward's door.
"Oh, it's you, is it?" said Mr. Hobbs sullenly.
"It is, Hobbs—very much me. I've been fishing with

royalty and chatting with the nobility. Where the

devil have you been?"
"I've been squaring it with old man Fraasch. I'm

through with you, sir. No more for me, not if I

know—"
"Come along, Hobbs," said the other blithely, taking

Hobbs by the arm. "The Prince sent his love to you."
"Did he mention Cook's?" gasped Hobbs.
"He certainly did," lied Truxton. "He spoke of you

most kindly. He wondered if you could find time to

come around to-morrow."

CHAPTER V
THE COMMITTEE OF TEN
It has been said before that Truxton King was the

unsuspecting object of interest to two sets of watchers.

The fact that he was under the surveillance of the

government police, is not surprising when we consider

the evident thoroughness of that department; but that

he should be continually watched by persons of a more

sinister cast suggests a mystery which can be cleared

up by visiting a certain underground room, scarce two

blocks from the Tower of Graustark. It goes without

saying that corporeal admittance to this room was not to

be obtained easily. In fact, one must belong to a certain

band of individuals; and, in order to belong to that

band, one must have taken a very solemn pledge of

eternal secrecy and a primal oath to devote his life to

certain purposes, good or evil, according to his conscience.

By means of the friendly Sesame that has

opened the way for us to the gentler secrets, we are permitted

to enter this forbidding apartment and listen in

safety to the ugly business of the Committee of Ten.
There were two ways of reaching this windowless

room, with its low ceilings and dank airs. If one had

the secret in his possession, he could go down through

the mysterious trap door in the workshop of William

Spantz, armourer to the Crown; or he might come up

through a hidden aperture in the walls of the great

government sewer, which ran directly parallel with and

far below the walls of the quaint old building. One

could take his choice of direction in approaching this

hole in the huge sewer: he could come up from the river,

half a mile away, or he could come down from the hills

above if he had the courage to drop through one of the

intakes.
It is of special significance that the trap door in

Spantz's workshop was reserved for use by the armourer

and his more fastidious comrades—of whom three were

women and one an established functionary in the Royal

Household. One should not expect ladies to traverse a

sewer if oilier ways are open to them. The manner of

reaching the workshop was not so simple, however, as

you might suppose. The street door was out of the

quest ion, with Dangloss on the watch, day and night.

As much as can be said for the rear door. It was necessary,

therefore, that the favored few should approach

the shop by extraordinary paths. For instance, two of

the women came through friendly but unknown doors

in the basements of adjoining houses, reaching the

workshop by the narrow stairs leading up from a cobwebby

wine-cellar next door. Spantz and Olga Platanova,

of course, were at home in the place. All of

which may go to prove that while ten persons comprised

the committee, at least as many more of the shopkeepers

in that particular neighbourhood were in sympathy with

their secret operations.
So cleverly were all these means of approach concealed

and so stealthy the movements of the Committee, that the

existence of this underground room, far below the street

level, was as yet unsuspected by the police. More than

that, the existence of the Committee of Ten as an organisation

was unknown to the department, notwithstanding

the fact that it had been working quietly,

seriously for more than a year.
The Committee of Ten represented the brains and the

activity of a rabid coterie in Edelweiss, among themselves

styled the Party of Equals. In plain language,

they were "Reds." Less than fifty persons in Graustark

were affiliated with this particular community of anarchists.

For more than a year they had been preparing

themselves against the all-important hour for public

declaration. Their ranks had been augmented by occasional

recruits from other lands; their literature was

circulated stealthily; their operations were as secret as

the grave, so far as the outside world was concerned.

And so the poison sprung up and thrived unhindered in

the room below the street, growing in virulence and

power under the very noses of the vaunted police of

Edelweiss, slowly developing into a power that would

some day assert itself with diabolical fury.
There were men and women from Axphain and Dawsbergen

in this seed circle that made Edelweiss its spreading

ground. They were Reds of the most dangerous

type—silent, voiceless, crafty men and women who built

well without noise, and who gave out nothing to the

world from which they expected to take so much.
The nominal leader was William Spantz, he who had a

son in the Prince's household, Julius Spantz, the Master-of-arms.

Far off in the hills above the Danube there

lived the real leader of this deadly group—the Iron

Count Marlanx, exile from the land of his birth, hated

and execrated by every loyal Graustarkian, hating and

execrating in return with a tenfold greater venom.

Marlanx, the man who had been driven from wealth and

power by the sharp edict of Prince Robin's mother, the

lamented Yetive, in the days of her most glorious reign,—this

man, deep in his raging heart, was in complete

accord with the desperate band of Reds who preached

equality and planned disaster.
Olga Platanova was the latest acquisition to this select

circle. A word concerning her: she was the daughter

of Professor Platanova, one time oculist and sociologist

in a large German University. He had been one of

the most brilliant men in Europe and a member of a

noble family. There was welcome for him in the homes

of the nobility; he hobnobbed, so to speak, with the

leading men of time Empire. The Platanova home in

Warsaw was one of the most inviting and exclusive in

that great, city. The professor's enthusiasm finally carried

him from the conservative paths in which he had

walked; after he had passed his fiftieth year he became

an avowed leader among the anarchists and revolutionists

in Poland, his native state. Less than a year before

the opening of this tale he was executed for treason and

conspiracy against the Empire.
His daughter, Olga, was recognised as one of the most

beautiful and cultured young women in Warsaw. Her

suitors seemed to be without number; nor were they confined

to the student and untitled classes with whom she

was naturally thrown by force of circumstance. More

than one lordly adventurer in the lists of love paid

homage to her grace and beauty. Finally there came

one who conquered and was beloved. He was the son of

a mighty duke, a prince of the blood.
It was true love for both of them. The young prince

pledged himself to marry her, despite all opposition;

he was ready to give up his noble inheritance for the

sake of love. But there were other forces greater than

a young man's love at work. The all-powerful ruler of

an Empire learned of this proposed mesalliance and was

horrified. Two weeks afterward the prince was called.

The will of the Crown was made known to him and—he

obeyed. Olga Platanova was cast aside but not forgotten.

He became the husband of an unloved, scrawny

lady of diadems. When the situation became more than

he could bear he blew out his brains.
When Olga heard the news of his death she was not

stricken by grief. She cried out her joy to a now cloudless

sky, for he had justified the great love that had

been theirs and would be theirs to the end of time.
From a passive believer in the doctrines of her father

and his circle she became at once their most impassioned

exponent. Over night she changed from a gentle-hearted

girl into a woman whose breast flamed with a

lust for vengeance against a class from which death

alone could free her lover. She threw herself, heart and

soul, into the deliberations and transactions of the great

red circle: her father understood and yet was amazed.
Then he was put to death by the class she had come to

hate. One more stone in the sepulchre of her tender,

girlish ideals. When the time came she travelled to

Graustark in response to the call of the Committee of

Ten; she came prepared to kill the creature she would

be asked to kill. And yet down in her heart she was

sore afraid.
She was there, not to kill a man grown old in wrongs

to her people, but to destroy the life of a gentle, innocent

boy of seven!
There were times when her heart shrank from the unholy

deed she had been selected to perform; she even

prayed that death might come to her before the hour in

which she was to do this execrable thing in behalf of the

humanity she served. But there was never a thought

of receding from the bloody task set down for her—a

task so morbid, so horrid that even the most vicious of

men gloated in the satisfaction that they had not been

chosen in her place. Weeks before she came to Graustark

Olga Platanova had been chosen by lot to be the

one to do this diabolical murder. She did not flinch,

but came resolute and ready. Even the men in the Committee

of Ten looked upon the slender, dark-eyed girl

with an awe that could not be conquered. She had not

the manner of an assassin, and yet they knew that she

would not draw back; she was as soft and as sweet as the

Madonnas they secretly worshipped, and yet her heart

was steeled to a purpose that appalled the fiercest of

them.
On a Saturday night, following the last visit of Truxton

King to the armourer, the Committee of Ten met in

the underground room to hear the latest word from one

who could not be with them in person, but was always

there in spirit—if they were to believe his most zealous

utterances. The Iron Count Marlanx, professed hater

of all that was rich and noble, was the power behind the

Committee of Ten. The assassination of the little

Prince and the overthrow of the royal family awaited

his pleasure: he was the man who would give the word.
Not until he was ready could anything be done, for

Marlanx had promised to put the Committee of Ten in

control of this pioneer community when it came under

the dominion of anarchists.
Alas, for the Committee of Ten! The wiliest fox in

the history of the world was never so wily as the Iron

Count. Some day they were to find out that he was

using them to pull his choicest chestnuts from the fire.
The Committee was seated around the long table in the stifling,

breathless room, the armourer at the head.

Those who came by way of the sewer had performed

ablutions in the queer toilet room that once had been a

secret vault for the storing of feudal plunder. What

air there was came from the narrow ventilator that burrowed

its ways up to the shop of William Spantz, or

through the chimney-hole in the ceiling. Olga Platanova

sat far down the side, a moody, inscrutable expression

in her dark eyes. She sat silent and oppressed

through all the acrid, bitter discussions which carried

the conclave far past the midnight hour. In her heart

she knew that these men and women were already thinking

of her as a regicide. It was settled—it was ordained.

At Spantz's right lounged Peter Brutus, a lawyer—formerly

secretary to the Iron Count and now his sole

representative among these people. He was a dark-faced,

snaky-eyed young man, with a mop of coarse

black hair that hung ominously low over his high, receding

forehead. This man was the chosen villain

among all the henchmen who came at the beck and call

of the Iron Count.
Julius Spantz, the armourer's son, a placid young man

of goodly physical proportions, sat next to Brutus,

while down the table ranged others deep in the consideration

of the world's gravest problems. One of the women

was Madame Drovnask, whose husband had been sent

to Siberia for life; and the other, Anna Cromer, a rabid

Red lecturer, who had been driven from the United

States, together with her amiable husband: an assassin

of some distinction and many aliases, at present

foreman in charge of one of the bridge-building crews

on the new railroad.
Every man in the party, and there were eight, for

Olga was not a member of the Ten, wore over the lower

part of his face a false black beard of huge dimensions.

Not that they were averse to recognition among themselves,

but in the fear that by some hook or crook Dangloss

or his agents might be able to look in upon them—through

stone walls, as it were. They were not men to

belittle the powers of the wonderful Baron.
As it sat in secret conclave, the Committee of Ten was

a sinister-looking group.
Brutus was speaking. "The man is a spy. He has

been brought here from America by Tullis. Sooner or

later you will find that I am right."
"It is best to keep close watch on him," advised one

of the men. "We know that he is in communication with

the police and we know that he visits the Castle, despite

his declaration that he knows no one there. To-day's

experience proves that. I submit that the strictest caution

be observed where he is concerned."
"We shall continue to watch his every movement," said

William Spantz. "Time will tell. When we are positive

that he is a detective and that he is dangerous, there

is a way to stop his operations."
His son grinned amiably as he swept his finger across

his throat. The old man nodded.
"Dangloss suspects more than one of us" ventured

Brutus, his gaze travelling toward Olga. There was

lewd admiration in that steady glance. "But we'll fool

the old fox. The time will soon be here for the blow

that frees Graustark from the yoke. She will be the

pioneer among our estates, we the first of the individuals

in equality; here the home seat of perfect rulership.

There is nothing that can stop us. Have we not the

most powerful of friends? Who is greater and

shrewder than Count Marlanx? Who could have

planned and perfected an organization so splendid?

Will any one dispute this?"
He had the floor, and having the floor means everything

to a Red. For half an hour he spoke with impassioned

fervour, descanting furiously on the amazing

virtues of his wily master and the plans he had arranged.

It appeared in the course of his remarks that

Marlanx had friends and supporters in all parts of

Graustark. Hundreds of men in the hills, including

honest shepherds and the dishonest brigands who

thrived on them, coal miners and wood stealers, hunters

and outlaws were ready to do his bidding when the time

was ripe. Moreover, Marlanx had been successful in

his design to fill the railway construction crews with the

riff-raff of all Europe, all of whom were under the

control of leaders who could sway them in any movement,

provided it was against law and order. As a

matter of fact, according to Brutus, nearly a thousand

aliens were at work on the road, all of them ready to

revolt the instant the command was given by their

advisers.
Something that the Committee of Ten did not know

was this: those alien workmen were no less than so many

hired mercenaries in the employ of the Iron Count,

brought together by that leader and his agents for the

sole purpose of overthrowing the Crown in one sudden,

unexpected attack, whereupon Count Marlanx would

step in and assume control of the government. They

had been collected from all parts of the world to do the

bidding of this despised nobleman, no matter to what

lengths he might choose to lead them. Brutus, of

course, knew all this: his companions on the Committee

were in complete ignorance of the true motives that

brought Marlanx into their operations.
With a cunning that commands admiration, the Iron

Count deliberately sanctioned the assassination of the

little Prince by the Reds, knowing that the condemnation

of the world would fall upon them instead of upon

him, and that his own actions following the regicide

would at once stamp him as irrevocably opposed to

anarchy and all of its practices!
In the course of his remarks, Peter Brutus touched

hastily upon the subject of the little Prince.
"He's not very big," said he, with a laugh, "and it

won't require a very big bomb to blow him to smithereens.

He will—"
"Stop!" cried Olga Platanova, springing to her feet

and glaring at him with dilated eyes. "I cannot listen

to you! You shall not speak of it in that way! Peter

Brutus, you are not to speak of—of what I am to do!

Never—never again!"
They looked at her in amazement and no little concern.

Madame Drovnask was the first to speak, her glittering

eyes fastened upon the drawn, white face of the

girl across the table.
"Are you going to fail? Are you weakening?" she

demanded.
"No! I am not going to fail! But I will not permit

any one to jest about the thing I am to do. It is a

sacred duty with me. But, Madame Drovnask—all

of you, listen—it is a cruel, diabolical thing, just the

same. Were it not in behalf of our great humanity,

I, myself, should call it the blackest piece of cruelty the

world has ever known. The slaughter of a little boy!

A dear, innocent little boy! I can see the horror in all

of your faces! You shudder as you sit there, thinking

of the thing I am to do. Yes, you are secretly despising

me, your instrument of death! I—I, a girl, I am to

cast the bomb that blows this dear little body to pieces.

I! Do you know what that means? Even though I

am sure to be blown to pieces by the same agent, the

last thing I shall look upon is his dear, terrified little

face as he watches me hurl the bomb. Ah!"
She shuddered violently as she stood there before them,

her eyes closed as if to shut out the horrible picture

her mind was painting. There were other white faces

and ice-cold veins about the table. The sneer on Anna

Cromer's face deepened.
"She will bungle it," came in an angry hiss from her

lips.
Olga's lids were lifted. Her dark eyes looked straight

into those of the older woman.
"No," she said quietly, her body relaxing, "I shall not

bungle it."
William Spantz had been watching her narrowly, even

suspiciously. Now his face cleared.
"She will not fail," he announced calmly. "Let there

be no apprehension. She is the daughter of a martyr.

Her blood is his. It will flow in the same cause. Sit

down, Olga, my dear. We will not touch upon this

subject again—until—"
"I know, uncle," she said quietly, resuming her seat

and her attitude of indifference.
The discussion went back to Truxton King. "Isn't it

possible that he is merely attracted by the beauty of

our charming young friend here?" ventured Madame

Drovnask, after many opinions had been advanced respecting

his interest in the shop and its contents. "It

is a habit with Americans, I am told."
"Miss Platanova is most worthy of the notice of any

man," agreed Brutus, with an amiable leer. Olga

seemed to shrink within herself. It was plain that she

was not a kindred spirit to these vicious natures.
"It is part of his game," said Julius Spantz. "He

knows Olga's past; he is waiting for a chance to catch

her off her guard. He may even go so far as to make

pretty love to you, cousin, in the hope that—no offence,

my dear, no offence!" Her look had silenced him.
"Mr. King is not a spy," she said steadily.
"Well," concluded William Spantz, "we are safe if

we take no chances with him. He must be watched all

the time. If we discover that he is what some of us

think he is, there is a way to end his usefulness."
"Let him keep away from the shop downstairs," said

Peter Brutus, with a sidelong glance at the delicate

profile of the girl down the table.
She smiled suddenly, to the amazement of her sinister

companions.
"Have no fear, Brutus. When he hears that you

object, he will be very polite and give us a wide berth,"

she said. Peter flushed angrily.
"He doesn't mean any good by you," he snapped.

"He'll fool you and—poof! Away he goes, rejoicing."
She still smiled. "You have a very good opinion of

me, Peter Brutus."
"Well," doggedly, "you know what men of his type

think of shopgirls. They consider them legitimate

prey."
"And what, pray, do men of your type think of us?"

she asked quietly.
"Enough of this," interposed William Spantz. "Now,

Brutus, what does Count Marlanx say to this day two

weeks? Will he be ready? On that day the Prince and

the Court are to witness the unveiling of the Yetive

memorial statue in the Plaza. It is a full holiday in

Graustark. No man will be employed at his usual task

and—"
Brutus interrupted him. "That is the very day that

the Count has asked me to submit to the Committee.

He believes it to be the day of all days. Nothing should

go amiss. We conquer with a single blow. By noon

of that day, the 26th of July, the Committee of Ten

will be in control of the State; the new regime will be

at hand. A new world will be begun, with Edelweiss as

the centre, about which all the rest shall revolve. We—the

Committee of Ten—will be its true founders. We

shall be glorified forever—"
"We've heard all this before, Brutus," said Julius

Spantz unfeelingly, "a hundred times. It's talk, talk,

talk! What we need now is action. Are we sure that

the Count will be prepared to do all that he says he

will on the 26th of July? Will he have his plans perfected?

Are his forces ready for the stroke?"
"Positively. They await the word. That's all I can

say," growled Peter. "The death of the Prince is the

signal for the overthrow of the present government and

the establishment of the new order of equal humanity."
"After all," mused Julius, Master-at-arms in the

Castle, "it is more humane to slay the Prince while he

is young. It saves him from a long life of trouble and

fear and the constant dread of the very thing that is to

happen to him now. Yes, it is best that it should come

soon." Down in his heart, Julius loved the little Prince.
For an hour longer the Committee discussed plans for

the eventful day. Certain details were left for future

deliberations; each person had his part to play and

each one was settled in his or her determination that

nothing should go amiss.
The man they feared was Dangloss. They did not

fear God!
When they dispersed for the night, it was to meet

again three days hence for the final word from Marlanx,

who, it seems, was not so far away that communication

with him was likely to be delayed. A sword hung over

the head of Truxton King, an innocent outsider, and

there was a prospect that it would fall in advance of

the blow that was intended to startle the world. Olga

Platanova was the only one who did not look upon the

sprightly American as a spy in the employ of the

government—a dangerously clever spy at that.
Up in the distant hills slept the Iron Count, dreaming

of the day when he should rule over the new Graustark—for

he would rule!—a smile on his grizzled face in

reflection of recent waking thoughts concerning the

punishment that should fall swiftly upon the assassins

of the beloved Prince Robin.
He would make short shrift of assassins!

CHAPTER VI
INGOMEDE THE BEAUTIFUL
A light, chilling drizzle had been falling all evening,

pattering softly upon the roof of leaves that covered

the sidewalks along Castle Avenue, glistening on the

lamp-lit pavements and blowing ever so gently in the

faces of those who walked in the dripping shades. Far

back from the shimmering sidewalks, surrounded by the

blackest of shadows, and approached by hedge-bordered

paths and driveways, stood the mansions occupied by

the nobility of this gay little kingdom. A score or more

of ancient palaces, in which the spirit, of modern aggression

had wrought interior changes but had left the exteriors

untouched, formed this aristocratic line of

homes. Here were houses that had been built in the

fifteenth century,—great, square, solemn-looking structures,

grown grey and green with age.
There were lights in a thousand windows along this

misty, royal road—lights that reflected the pleasures

of the rich and yet caused no envy in time hearts of the

loyal poor.
Almost in the centre of the imposing line stood the

home of the Duke of Perse, Minister of Finance, flanked

on either side by structures as grim and as gay as

itself, yet far less significant in their generation. Here

dwelt the most important man in the principality, not

excepting the devoted prime minister himself. Not that

Perse was so well beloved, but that he held the destinies

of the land in Midas-like fingers. More than that, he

was the father of the far-famed Countess Marlanx, the

most glorious beauty at the Austrian and Russian

courts. She had gone forth from Graustark as its most

notable bride since the wedding day of the Princess

Yetive, late in the nineties. Ingomede, the beautiful, had

journeyed far to the hymeneal altar; the husband who

claimed her was a hated, dishonoured man in his own

land. They were married in Buda Pesth. All Europe

pitied her at the time; there was but one form of prophecy

as to her future. There were those who went so

far as to say that her father had delivered her into the

hands of a latter-day Bluebeard, who whisked her off

into the highlands many leagues from Vienna.
She was seen no more in the gay courts for a year.

Then, of a sudden, she appeared before them all, as

dazzlingly beautiful as ever, but with a haunting, wistful

look in her dark eyes that could not be mistaken.

The old Count found an uneasy delight in exhibiting

her to the world once more, plainly as a bit of property

that all men were expected to look upon with envy

in their hearts. She came up out of the sombre

hills, freed from what must have been nothing less than

captivity in that once feudal castle, to prove to his

world that she thrived in spite of prophetic babblers.

They danced from court to court, grotesquely mis-mated,

deceiving no one as to the true relations that

existed between them. She despised him without concealment;

he took pride in showing that he could best

resent her attitude by the most scrupulous devotion, so

marked that its intent could not be mistaken.
Then the Duke of Perse resumed his residence in Edelweiss,

opening the old palace once more to the world.

His daughter, after the death of the Princess, began her

extended visits to the home of her girlhood. So long as

the Princess was alive she remained away from Edelweiss,

reluctant to meet the friend who had banished

her husband long before the wedding day in Buda Pesth.

Now she came frequently and stayed for weeks at a time,

apparently happy during these escapes from life in the

great capitals. Here, at least, she was free from the

grim old man whose countess she was; here, all was

sweet and warm and friendly, delicious contrast to the

cold, bitter life she knew on the Danube.
Without warning she came and without farewells she

left Edelweiss on the occasion of these periodical visits.

No word was ever spoken concerning her husband, except

on the rare occasions when she opened her heart to

the father who had bartered her into slavery for the

sake of certain social franchises that the Iron Count

had at his disposal. The outside world, which loved her,

never heard of these bitter passages between father and

child. Like Cinderella, she sometimes disappeared from

joyous things at midnight; the next heard of her, she

was in Vienna, or at Schloss Marlanx.
If the Duke of Perse repented of his bargain in giving

his daughter to the Iron Count, he was never known to

intimate as much. He loved Ingomede in his own, hard

way. No doubt he was sorry for her. It is a fact that

she was sorry for him. She could read his bitter

thoughts more clearly than he suspected.
Of late she came more frequently to Edelweiss than

before. She was seen often at the Castle; no court

function was complete without the presence of this

lovely noblewoman; no salon worth while unless graced

by her wit and her beauty.
John Tullis was always to remember the moment when

he looked upon this exquisite creature for the first time.

That was months ago. After that he never ceased

being a secret, silent worshipper at her transient shrine.
Ten o'clock on this rainy night: A carriage has

drawn up before the lower gates to the Perse grounds,

and a tall, shadowy figure leaves it to hurry through the

shrub lined walks to the massive doors. A watchman in

the garden salutes him. The tall figure dips his umbrella

in response, characteristically laconic. A footman

lifts his hand to his forelock at the top of the steps

and throws open the doors without question. This

visitor is expected, it is plain to be seen; a circumstance

which may or may not explain the nervousness that attends

him as he crosses the broad hall toward the

library.
Tullis had long since ceased to be a welcome visitor in

the home of the Duke of Perse. The men were openly

unfriendly to each other. The Duke resented the cool

interference of the sandy-haired American; on the

other hand, Tullis made no effort to conceal his dislike,

if not distrust, of the older man. He argued—with

unofficial and somewhat personal authority,—that a

man who could trade his only child for selfish ends

might also be impelled to sacrifice his country's interests

without cramping his conscience.
The Countess was alone in the long, warm-tinted

library. She stood before the dying embers in the

huge old fireplace, her foot upon one of the great iron

dogs. Her smiling face was turned toward the door as

he entered.
"It is good of you to come," she said, as they shook

hands warmly. "Do you know it is almost a year since

you last came to this house?"
"It would be a century, Countess, if I were not welcomed

in other houses where I am sure of a glimpse of

you from time to time and a word now and then. Still,

a year's a year. The room hasn't changed so far as I

can see. The same old tiger-skin there, the rugs, the

books, the pictures—the leopard's skin here and the—yes,

the lamp is just where it used to be. 'Pon my

soul, I believe you are standing just as you were when

I last saw you here. It's uncanny. One might think

you had not moved in all these months!"
"Or that it has been a minute instead of a year," she

supplemented. His quick, involuntary glance about him

did not escape her understanding. "The Duke has gone

to Ganlook to play Bridge with friends," she said at

once. "He will not return till late. I have just telephoned—to

make sure." Her smile did more than to

reassure him.
"Of course, you will understand how impossible it is

for me to come here, Countess. Your father, the Duke,

doesn't mince matters, and I'm not quite a fool." Tullis

squinted at the fire.
"Do you think ill of me for asking you to come

to-night?"
"Not at all," he said cheerfully, "so long as you are

quite sure that your father is in Ganlook. He would

be perfectly justified in kicking me out if he were to

catch me here. And as I'm rather cumbersome and

he's somewhat venerable, I don't like to think of the

jar it would be to his system. But, so long as he isn't

here, and I am, why shouldn't I draw up a chair before

the fire for you, and another for myself, with the

cigarettes and a world between us, to discuss conditions

as they are, not as they might be if we were discovered?

Shall I? Good! I defy any one's father to get me out

of this chair until I am ready to relinquish it voluntarily."
"I suppose you superintended the 'going-to-bed' of

Prince Robin before you left the Castle?" she said, lying

back in the comfortable chair and stretching her

feet out to the fire. He handed her a match and watched

her light the long, ridiculously thin cigarette.
"Yes. I never miss it, Countess. The last thing he

does, after saying his prayers, is to recall me from

exile. He wouldn't be happy if he couldn't do that.

He says amen and hops into bed. Then he grins in a

far from imperial way and announces that he's willing

to give me another chance, and please won't I tell him

the latest news concerning Jack-the-giant-killer. He

asked me to-night if I thought you'd mind if he

banished your father. They've had a children's quarrel,

I believe. If you do mind, I am to let him know: he

won't banish him. He's very fond of you, Countess."

She laughed gaily.
"He is a dear boy. I adore him. I think I quite

understand why you are giving up your life to him. At

first I wasn't sure."
"You thought I expected to gain something by it, is

not that so? Well, there are a great many people who

think so still—your father among them. They'll never

understand. I don't blame them, for, I declare to you,

I don't fully appreciate it myself. John Tullis playing

nurse and story-teller to a seven-year-old boy, to the

exclusion of everything else, is more than I can grasp.

Somehow, I've come to feel that he's mine. That must

be the reason. But you've heard me prate on this subject

a hundred times. Don't let me start it again.

There's something else you want to talk to me about,

so please don't encourage me to tell all the wonderful

things he has said and done to-day."
"It is of the Prince that I want to speak, Mr. Tullis,"

she said, suddenly serious. "I don't care to hear

whether he stubbed his toe to-day or just how much he

has grown since yesterday, but I do want to talk very

seriously with you concerning his future—I might say

his immediate future."
He looked at her narrowly.
"Are you quite serious?"
"Quite. I could not have asked you to come to this

house for anything trivial. We have become very good

friends, you and I. Too good, perhaps, for I've no

doubt there are old tabbies in Edelweiss who are provoked

to criticism—you know what I mean. Their

world is full of imaginary affairs, else what would there

be left for old age? But we are good friends and we

understand why we are good friends, so there's the end

to that. As I say, I could not have asked so true a

friend into the house of his enemy for the mere sake

of having my vanity pleased by his obedience."
"I am quite sure of that," he said. "Are you in

trouble, Countess? Is there anything I can do?"
"It has to do with the Prince, not with me," she said.

"And yet I am in trouble—or perhaps I should say, I

am troubled."
"The Prince is a sturdy little beggar," he began, but

she lifted her hand in protest.
"And he has sturdy, loyal friends. That is agreed.

And yet—" she paused, a perplexed line coming between

her expressive eyes.
John Tullis opened his own eyes very wide. "You

don't mean to say that he is—he is in peril of any sort?"
She looked at him a long time before speaking. He

could feel that she was turning something over in her

mind before giving utterance to the thought.
At last she leaned nearer to him, dropping the ash

from her cigarette into the receiver as she spoke slowly,

intensely. "I think he is in peril—in deadly peril."
He stared hard. "What do you mean?" he demanded,

with an involuntary glance over his shoulder. She interpreted

that glance correctly.
"The peril is not here, Mr. Tullis. I know what you

are thinking. My father is a loyal subject. The peril

I suggest never comes to Graustark."
She said no more but leaned forward, her face whiter

than its wont. He frowned, but it was the effect of

temporary perplexity. Gradually the meaning of her

simple, though significant remark filtered through his

brain.
"Never comes to Graustark?" he almost whispered.

"You don't—you can't mean your—your husband?"
"I mean Count Marlanx," she said steadily.
"He means evil to Prince Robin? Good Heavens,

Countess, I—I can't believe it. I know he is bitter,

revengeful, and all that, but—"
"He is all that and more," she said. "First, you must

let me impress you that I am not a traitor to his cause.

I could not be that, for the sufficient reason that I only

suspect its existence. I am not in any sense a part of it.

I do not know anything. I only feel. I dare say you

realise that I do not love Count Marlanx—that there is

absolutely nothing in common between us except a

name. We won't go into that. I—"
"I am overjoyed to hear you say this, Countess," he

said very seriously. "I have been so bold on occasion

as to assert—for your private ear, of course—that you

could not, by any freak of nature, happen to care for

Count Marlanx, whom I know only by description. You

have laughed at my so-called American wit, and you

have been most tolerant. Now, I feel that I am justified.

I'm immeasurably glad to hear you confess that you do

not love your husband."
"I cannot imagine any one so stupid as to think that

I do love Count Marlanx, for that matter, that he

loves me. Still, I am relieved to hear you say that you

are glad. It simplifies the present for us, and that is

what we are to discuss."
"You are very, very beautiful, and young, and unhappy,"

he said irrelevantly, a darker glow in his

cheeks. She smiled serenely, without a trace of diffidence

or protest.
"I can almost believe it, you say it so convincingly,"

she said. For a moment she relaxed luxuriantly into

an attitude of physical enjoyment of herself, surveying

her toe-tips with a thoughtfulness that comprehended

more; and then as abruptly came back to the business

of the moment. "You must not spoil it all by saying

it too fervently," she went on with a smile of warning.

He gave a short laugh of confusion and sank back in

the chair.
"You have never tried to make love to me," she went

on. "That's what I like about you. I think most men

are silly, not because I am so very young, but because

my husband is so ridiculously old. Don't you think so?

But, never mind! I see you are quite eager to answer—that's

enough. Take another cigarette and—listen to

what I am going to say." He declined the cigarette

with a shake of his head.
After a moment she went on resolutely: "As I said

before, I do not know that my suspicions are correct.

I have not even breathed them to my father. He would

have laughed at me. My husband is a Graustarkian,

even as I am, but there is this distinction between us:

he despises Graustark, while I love her in every drop of

my blood. I know that in his heart he has never ceased

to brew evil for the throne that disgraced him. He

openly expresses his hatred for the present dynasty,

and has more than once said in public gatherings that

he could cheerfully assist in its utter destruction. That,

of course, is commonly known in Graustark, where he is

scorned and derided. But he is not a man to serve his

hatred with mere idle words and inaction." She stopped

for a moment, and then cried impulsively: "I must

first know that you will not consider me base and disloyal

in saying these things to you. After all, he is

my husband."
He saw the faint curl of her lip. "Before that," he

argued simply, "you were a daughter of Graustark.

You were not born to serve a cause that means evil to

the dear land. Graustark first made you noble; you

can't go back on that, you know. Don't let your husband

degrade you. I think you can see how I feel about

it. Please believe that I know you can do no wrong."


"You are the only man to whom I feel

sure that I can reveal myself and be quite understood."


"Thank you," she said, returning the look in his

earnest grey eyes with one in which the utmost confidence

shone. "You are the only man to whom I feel

sure that I can reveal myself and be quite understood.

It isn't as if I had positive facts to divulge, for I have

not; they are suspicions, fears, that's all, but they are

no longer vague shapes to me; they mean something."
"Tell me," he said quietly. He seemed to square his

broad shoulders and to set his jaw firmly, as if to resist

physical attack. She knew she had come with her fears

to a man in whose face it was declared that he could

laugh at substance as well as shadow.
"I am seeing you here in this big room, openly, for the

simple reason that if I am being watched this manner

of meeting may be above suspicion. We may speak

freely here, for we cannot be heard unless we raise our

voices. Don't betray surprise or consternation. The

eyes of the wall may be better than its ears."
"You don't mean to say you are being watched here in

your father's house?" he demanded.
"I don't know. This I do know: the Count has many

spies in Edelweiss. He is systematically apprised of

everything that occurs at court, in the city, or in the

council chamber. So you see, he is being well served,

whether to an evil purpose or to satisfy his own innate

curiosity, I do not know. He has reports almost daily,—voluminous

things, partly in cipher, partly free, and

he is forever sending men away on secret, mysterious missions.

Understand, I do not know that he is actually

planning disaster to Graustark. Day before yesterday I

saw his secretary in the streets—a man who has been in

his employ for five years or more and who now pretends

to be a lawyer here. His name is Brutus. I spoke with

him. He said that he had left the Count six weeks ago

in Vienna, determined to set out for himself in his chosen

profession. He knows, of course, that I am not and

never have been in the confidences of my husband. I

asked him if it was known in Edelweiss that he had

served the Count as secretary. He promptly handed

me one of his business cards, on which he refers to himself

as the former trusted and confidential secretary of

Count Marlanx. Now, I happen to know that he is still

in my husband's service,—or was no longer ago than

last week."
"My dear Countess, he may be serving him legitimately

as an attorney. There would be nothing strange in

that."
"But he is still serving him as confidential secretary.

He is here for a purpose, as my husband's representative.

I have not been asleep all these months at Schloss

Marlanx. I have seen and heard enough to convince

me that some great movement is on foot. My intelligence

tells me that it has to do with Graustark. As he

wishes the Prince no good, it must be for evil."

"But there is nothing he can do. He has no following

here. The Prince is adored by the people. Count

Marlanx would not be such a fool as to—"
"He is no fool," she interrupted quickly. "That's

why I am afraid. If he is plotting against the Crown,

you may depend upon it he is laying his plans well.

John Tullis, that man is a devil—a devil incarnate."

She turned her face away.
A spasm of utter repugnance crossed her face; she

shuddered so violently that his hand went forth to

clutch the fingers that trembled on the arm of the chair.

He held them in his firm grasp for a moment. They

looked into each other's eyes and he saw the flicker of

undisguised horror in hers. An instant later she was

herself again. Withdrawing her hand, she added, with

a short laugh of derision: "Still I did not expect

heaven, so why complain."
"But you are an angel," he blurted out.
"I don't believe the Count will agree to that," she

said, with a reflective twinkle in her dark eyes. "He

has not found me especially angelic. If you imagine

that I cannot scratch back, my dear friend, you are

very much mistaken. I have had the pleasure of giving

him more than one bad half hour. You may be sure

he has never called me an angel. Quite the other thing,

I assure you. But we are straying from the point."
"Wait a moment, please," he commanded. "I want to

say to you here and now: you are the gentlest, loveliest

woman I have ever known. I don't say it idly. I mean

it. If you gave him half as good as he sent, I rejoice

in your spirit. Now, I want to ask if you expect to

go back to live with the da—with him."
"That, Mr. Tullis, is hardly a matter I can discuss

with you," she said gently, and he was not offended.
"Perhaps not, Countess, but now is the time for you

to decide the issue. Why should you return to Castle

Marlanx? Why keep up the farce—or I might say,

tragedy—any longer? You love Graustark. You love

the Prince. You betray them both by consorting with

their harshest foe. Oh, I could tell you a thousand

reasons why—"
"We haven't time for them," she interrupted, with

mock despair in her face. "Besides, I said we cannot

discuss it. It requires no learned argument to move

me, one way or the other. I can decide for myself."
"You should divorce him," he said harshly.
She laughed easily, softly. "My good friend, if I

did that, I'd lose your friendship." He opened his lips

to remonstrate, but suddenly caught the undercurrent

of the naive remark.
"By Jove," he said, his eyes glowing, "you must not

risk finding me too obtuse."
"Bravo!" she cried. "You are improving."
"I could provide a splendid substitute for the friendship

you speak of," he said coolly.
"Poof! What is that to me? I could have a hundred

lovers—but, ach, friends are the scarcest things in the

world. I prefer friendship. It lasts. There! I see

disapproval in your face! You Americans are so

literal." She gazed into the fireplace for a moment,

her lips parted in a whimsical smile. He waited for her

to go on; the words were on her tongue's end, he could

tell. "A divorce at twenty-five. I believe that is the

accepted age, isn't it? If one gets beyond that, she—but,

enough of this!" She sprang to her feet and stood

before him, the flash dying in her eyes even as it was

born that he might see so briefly. "We diverge! You

must go soon. It is best not to be seen leaving here at

a very late hour—especially as my father is known to

be away. I am afraid of Peter Brutus. He is here to

watch—everybody."
She was leaning against the great carved mantel post,

a tall, slender, lissome creature, exquisitely gowned in

rarest Irish lace, her bare neck and shoulders gleaming

white against the dull timbers beyond, the faint glow

from the embers creeping up to her face with the insistence

of a maiden's flush. He gazed in rapt admiration,

his heart thumping like fury in his great breast.

She was little more than a girl, this wife of old Marlanx,

and yet how wise, how clever, how brilliant she was!
A face of unusual pallor and extremely patrician in

its modelling, surmounted by a coiffure so black that it

could be compared only to ebony—black and almost

gleaming with the life that was in it. It came low on

her forehead, shading the wondrous dark eyes—eyes

that were a deep yellowish green in their division between

grey and black, eyes that were soft and luminous

and unwaveringly steadfast, impelling in their power to

fascinate, yet even more dangerously compassionate

when put to the test that tries woman's vanity.
There were diamonds on her long, tapering fingers, and

a rope of pearls in her hair. A single wide gold band

encircled her arm above the elbow, an arm-band as old

as the principality itself, for it had been worn by

twenty fair ancestors before her. The noblewomen of

Graustark never wore bracelets on their wrists; always

the wide chased gold band on the upper arm. There

was a day, not so far back in history, when they wore

bands on their ankles.
She was well named Ingomede, the Beautiful.
A soft, almost imperceptible perfume, languorous in

its appeal to the senses, exuded from this perfect creation;

added to this, the subtle, unfailing scent of young

womanhood; the warm, alive feel of her presence in the

atmosphere; a suggestion of something sensuous, clean,

pure, delicious. The undescribable.
"Does Baron Dangloss know this man Brutus?"

asked Tullis, arising to stand beside her. A sub-conscious,

triumphant thrill shot through him as an instantaneous

flash of his own physical superiority over

this girl's husband came over him. He was young and

strong and vital. He could feel the sensation of being

strong; he tingled with the glory of it. He was

thirty-five, Marlanx seventy. He wondered if

Marlanx had ever been as strong as he.
"I don't know," she said thoughtfully. "I have not

spoken to him concerning Brutus. Perhaps he knows.

The Baron is very wise. Let me tell you how I happen

to know that Peter Brutus is still serving Count

Marlanx and why I think his presence signifies a crisis

of some sort." Tullis stood facing the great fireplace,

his back to the hail. He observed that she looked

toward the doors quite as often as she looked at him;

it struck him that she was extremely cautious despite

her apparent ease.
Her voice, always low and even, second lower still.

"In the first place, I have a faithful friend in one of

the oldest retainers at Schloss Marlanx. His daughter

is my maid. She is here with me now. The old man

came to see Josepha one day last week. He had accompanied

Count Marlanx to the town of Balak, which

is in Axphain, a mile beyond the Graustark line. Peter

Brutus was with my husband in Balak for two days.

They were closeted together from morning till night in

the house where Marlanx was stopping. At the end

of two days Brutus went away, but he carried with him

a vast sum of money provided by my husband. It was

given out that he was on his way to Serros in Dawsbergen,

where he expected to purchase a business block

for his master. Marlanx waited another day in Balak,

permitting Josepha's father to come on to Edelweiss

with a message for me and to see his daughter. He—"
"And Josepha's father saw Brutus in Edelweiss?"
"No. But he did see him going into Balak as he left

for Edelweiss that morning. He wore a disguise, but

Jacob says he could not be mistaken. Moreover, he was accompanied

by several men whom he recognised as Graustark

mountaineers and hunters of rather unsavoury

reputation. They left Brutus at the gates of Balak

and went off into the hills. All this happened before I

knew that Peter was living in Edelweiss. When I saw

him here, I knew at once that his presence meant something

sinister. I can put many things together that

once puzzled me—the comings and goings of months,

the secret reports and consultations, the queer looking

men who came to the Castle, the long absences of my

husband and my—my own virtual imprisonment—yes,

imprisonment. I was not permitted to leave the castle

for days at a time during his absences."
"Surely you will not go back again"—he began hotly.
"Sh!" She put a finger to her lips. A man-servant

was quietly crossing the hall just off the library. "He

is a new man. I do not like his appearance."
"Do you think he heard us or observed anything? I

can make short work of him if—" He paused significantly.

She smiled up into his face.
"He did not hear anything. We've frightened him

off, if he intended to play the eavesdropper." The

servant had disappeared through a door at the end of

the hall.
"Then there were the great sums of money that my

husband sent off from time to time, and the strange

boxes that came overland to the castle and later went

away again as secretly as they came. Mr. Tullis, I am

confident in my mind that those boxes contained firearms

and ammunition. I have thought it all out. Perhaps

I am wrong, but it seems to me that I can almost

see those firearms stored away in the caves and cabins

outside of Edelweiss, ready for instant use when the

signal comes."
"God! An uprising? A plot so huge as that?" he

gasped, amazed. It is fortunate that he was not facing

the door; the same servant, passing once more, might

have seen the tell-tale consternation in his eyes. "It

cannot be possible! Why, Dangloss and his men would

have scented it long ago."
"I have not said that I am sure of anything, remember

that. I leave it to you to analyse. You have the

foundation on which to work. I'd advise you to waste

no time. Something tells me that the crisis is near at

hand."
"Why should Josepha's father tell these things to

you?"
"Because, if you will pardon my frankness, I have

protected his daughter against Count Marlanx. He

understands. And yet he would not betray a trust imposed

upon him even by the Count. He has only told

me what any one else might have seen with his own

eyes. Wait! The new servant is in the hall again."

She clapped her hands sharply and called out "Franz!"
The new man appeared in the doorway almost on the

instant. "You may replenish the fire, Franz." The

man, a sallow, precise fellow, crossed deliberately and

poked the half dead fire; with scrupulous care he selected

two great chunks of wood from the hopper near

by and laid them on the coals, the others watching his

movements with curious interest. There was nothing

about the fellow to indicate that he was other than what

he pretended to be.
"Isn't it strange that we should have fires in July?"

she asked casually. "The mountain air and the night

fogs make it absolutely necessary in these big old

houses."
"We had a jolly fire in the Prince's room when I left

the Castle. Our monarch is subject to croup, you see."
"That is all, Franz." The man bowed and left the

room. "What do you think of him?" she asked, after a

moment.
"He has a very bad liver," was all Tullis deigned to offer

in response. The Countess stared for a moment and

then laughed understandingly. "I think he needs a

change."
"I have a strange feeling that he is but one of a great

many men who are in Edelweiss for the purposes I mentioned

before. Now I have a favour to ask of you. Will

you take this matter up with Baron Dangloss as if on

your own initiative? Do not mention me in any way.

You can understand why I ask this of you. Let them

believe that the suspicions are yours. I trust you to

present them without involving me."
"Trust me, my dear Countess. I am a very diplomatic

liar. You need have no fear. I shall find a quick way

of getting my friend Dangloss on the right track. It

may be a wild goose chase, but it is best to be on the safe

side. May I now tell you how greatly I appreciate your

confidence in—"
She stopped him with a glance. "No, you may not tell

me. There is nothing more to be said."
"I think I understand," he said gently.
"Let us change the subject. I have uttered my word

to the wise. Eh bien! It may not be so bad as I think.

Let us hope so, at least."
"I have a vague notion that you'd rejoice if we should

catch your ogre and chop his head off," said he, coolly

lighting a fresh cigarette. She liked his assurance. He

was not like other men.
Glancing up at his sandy thatch, she said, with a rueful

droop at the corners of her mouth, a contradictory smile

in her eyes: "I shall rejoice more if you do not lose

your head afterwards."
"Double entendre?"
"Not at all."
"I thought, perhaps, you referred to an unhappy

plight that already casts its shadow before," he said

boldly. "I may lose everything else, my dear Countess,

but not my head."
"I believe you," she said, strangely serious. "I shall

remember that."
She knew this man loved her.
"Sit down, now, and let us be comfy. We are quite

alone," she added instantly, a sudden confusion coming

over her. "First, will you give me that box of candy

from the table? Thank you so much for sending it to

me. How in the world do you manage to get this wonderful

New York candy all the way to Graustark? It is

quite fresh and perfectly delicious."
"Oh, Fifth Avenue isn't so far away as you think,"

he equivocated. "It's just around the corner—of the

world. What's eight or nine thousand miles to a

district messenger boy? I ring for one and he fetches

the candy, before you can wink your eye or say Jack

Robinson. It's a marvellous system."
He watched her white teeth set themselves daintily in

the rich nougat; then the red lips closed tranquilly only

to open again in a smile of rapture. For reasons best

known to himself, he chose not to risk losing the thing

he had vowed not to lose. He turned his head—and

carefully inspected the end of his cigarette. A wholly

unnecessary precaution, as any one might have seen that

it was behaving beautifully.
Her eyes narrowed ever so slightly as she studied his

averted face in that brief instant. When he turned to

her again, she was resting her head against the back of

the chair, and her eyes were closed as if in exquisite enjoyment

of the morsel that lay behind her smiling lips.
"Are you enjoying it?" he asked.
"Tremendously," she replied, opening her eyes slowly.
"'Gad, I believe you are," he exclaimed. She sat up

at once, and caught her breath, although he did not

know it. His smile distinctly upset her tranquillity.
"By the way," he added, as if dismissing the matter,

"have you forgotten that on Tuesday we go to the

Witch's hut in the hills? Bobby has dingdonged it into

me for days."
"It will be good fun," she said. Then, as a swift afterthought:

"Be sure that the bodyguard is strong—and true."

CHAPTER VII
AT THE WITCH'S HUT
The next morning, before setting forth to consult the

minister of police at the Tower, he called up the Perse

palace on the telephone and asked for the Countess, to

tell her in so many words that he had been followed from

her door to the very gates of the Castle grounds. Not

by one man alone, for that would have excited suspicion,

but by half a dozen at least, each one taking up the

surveillance in the most casual manner as the watcher

before him left off. Tullis was amazed by the cunning

which masked these proceedings; there was a wily brain

behind it.
The Duke's secretary answered the call. Tullis was

completely bowled over by the curt information that the

Countess Marlanx had left Edelweiss before six that

morning, to join her husband, who was shooting wild

boars with a party in Axphain.
"When does she return?" demanded the American,

scarcely believing his ears. She had said nothing of

this the night before. What could it mean?
"I do not know, sir."
"In a day or two?"
"She took sixteen trunks, sir," was the laconic reply,

as if that told the story in full.
"Well, I'm damned!"
"I beg pardon, sir!"
"I beg your pardon. Good morning."

In the meantime, our excellent young friend, Truxton

King, was having a sorry time of it. It all began when

he went to the Cathedral in the hope of seeing the charming

aunt of the little Prince once more. Not only did

he attend one service, but all of them, having been

assured that the royal family worshipped there quite as

regularly and as religiously as the lowliest communicant.

She did not appear.
More than all this, he met with fresh disappointment

when he ambled down to the armourer's shop. The

doors were locked and there was no sign of life about

the shuttered place. The cafés were closed on this day

of rest, so there was nothing left for him to do but to

slink off to his room in the Regengetz, there to read or

to play solitaire and to curse the progress of civilisation.
Monday was little better than Sunday. Hobbs positively

refused to escort him to the Castle grounds again.

No amount of bribing or browbeating could move the

confounded Englishman from his stand. He was willing

to take him anywhere else, but never again would he risk

a personally conducted tour into hot waters royal. Mr.

King resigned himself to a purely business call at the

shop of Mr. Spantz. He looked long, with a somewhat

shifty eye, at the cabinet of ancient rings and necklaces,

and then departed without having seen the interesting

Miss Platanova. If the old man observed a tendency

to roam in the young man's eye, he did not betray the

fact—at least not so that any one could notice. Truxton

departed, but returned immediately after luncheon,

vaguely inclined to decide between two desirable rings.

After a protracted period of indecision, in which Olga

remained stubbornly out of sight, he announced that he

could not make up his mind, and would return later for

another inspection.
At his room in the hotel, he found a note addressed to

himself. It did not have much to say, but it meant a

great deal. There was no signature, and the handwriting

was that of a woman.
"Please do not come again." That was all.
He laughed with a fine tone of defiance and—went back

to the shop at five o'clock, just to prove that nothing

so timid as a note could stop him. This, however, was

after he had taken a long walk down Castle Avenue,

with a supplementary stroll of little incident outside the

grim, high walls that enclosed the grounds. If any one

had told him that he was secretly hoping to find a crevasse

through which he could invade paradise, I make

no doubt he would have resented the imputation soundly.

On the occasion of this last visit to the shop, he did not

stay long, but went away somewhat dazed to find himself

the possessor of a ring he did not want and out of

pocket just thirty dollars, American. Having come to

the conclusion that knight-errantry of that kind was not

only profligate but distinctly irritating to his sense of

humour, he looked up Mr. Hobbs and arranged for a

day's ride in the mountains.
"You'll oblige me, Mr. Hobbs, by removing that band

from your cap. I know you're an interpreter. It's an

insult to my intelligence to have it flaunted in my face

all day long. I'll admit you're what you say you are,

so take it off before we start out to-morrow."
And so, minus the beguiling insignia of office, Mr. Hobbs

led his hypercritical patron into the mountain roads

early the next morning, both well mounted and provided

with a luncheon large enough to restore the amiability

that was sure to flag at mid-day unless sustained by

unæsthetic sandwiches and beer.
The day was bright and clear, warm in the valley where

the city lay, cooler to cold as one mounted the winding

roads that led past the lofty Monastery of St. Valentine,

sombre sentinel among the clouds.
A part of Edelweiss is built along the side of the mountain,

its narrow streets winding upward and past countless

terraces to the very base of the rocky, jagged

eminence at whose top, a full mile above the last sprinkling

of houses, stands the isolated, bleak Monastery. The

view from these upper streets, before one enters the

circuitous and hidden Monastery road that winds afar

in its climb, is never to be forgotten by the spectator, no

matter how often he traverses the lofty thoroughfares.

As far as the eye can reach, lies the green valley,

through which winds the silvery river with its evergreen

banks and spotless white houses-greens and whites that

almost shame the vaunted tints of old Ireland as one

views them from the incoming steamers. Immediately

below one's feet lies the compact little city, with its red

roofs and green chimney pots, its narrow streets and

vivid awnings, its wide avenues and the ancient Castle to

the north. To the south, the fortress and the bridges;

encircling the city a thick, high wall with here and

there enormous gates flanked by towers so grim and old

that they seem ready to topple over from the sheer

fatigue of centuries. A soft, Indian summer haze hangs

over the lazy-lit valley; it is always so in the summer

time.
Outside the city walls stretch the wheat-fields and the

meadows, the vineyards and orchards, all snug in the

nest of forest-crowned hills, whose lower slopes are

spotted with broken herds of cattle and the more mobile

flocks of sheep. An air of tranquillity lies low over the

entire vista; one dozes if he looks long into this peaceful

bowl of plenty.
From the distant passes in the mountains to the east

and north come the dull intonations of dynamite blasts,

proving the presence of that disturbing element of progress

which is driving the railroad through the unbroken

heart of the land.
It is a good three hours' ride to the summit of Monastery

Mountain. And, after the height has been attained,

one does not care to linger long among the chilly,

whistling crags, with their snow-crevasses and bitter

winds; the utter loneliness, the aloofness of this frost-crowned

crest appals, disheartens one who loves the fair,

green things of life. In the shelter of the crags, at the

base of the Monastery walls, looking out over the sunlit

valley, one has his luncheon and his snack of spirits

quite undisturbed, for the monks pay no heed to him.

They are not hospitable, neither are they unfriendly.

One seldom sees them.
Truxton King and Mr. Hobbs were not long in disposing

of their lunch. It was too cold for comfort in their

draughty dining-room, and they were not invited to enter

the inhospitable gates. In half an hour they were

wending their way down the north side of the peak by

gradually declining roads, headed for the much-talked-of

home of the Witch in Ganlook Gap, some six miles

from Edelweiss as the crow flies, but twice that distance

over the tortuous bridle paths and post roads.
It was three o'clock when they clattered down the stone

road and up to the forbidding vale in which lurked, like

an evil, guilty thing, the log-built home of that ancient

female who made no secret of her practices in witchcraft.

The hut stood back from the mountain road a

hundred yards or more, at the head of a small, thicket-

grown recess.
A low, thatched roof protruded from the hill against

which the hut was built. As a matter of fact, a thin

chimney grew out of the earth itself, for all the world

like a smoking tree stump. The hovel was a squalid, beggary

thing that might have been built over night somewhere

back in the dark ages. Its single door was so low

that one was obliged to stoop to enter the little room

where the dame had been holding forth for three-score

years, 'twas said. This was her throne-room, her dining-room,

her bed-chamber, her all, it would seem, unless one

had been there before and knew that her kitchen was

beyond, in the side of the hill. The one window, sans

glass, looked narrowly out upon an odd opening in the

foliage below, giving the occupant of the hut an unobstructed

view of the winding road that led up from

Edelweiss. The door faced the Monastery road down

which the two men had just ridden. As for the door

yard, it was no more than a pebbly, avalanche-swept

opening among the trees and rocks, down which in the

glacial age perhaps a thousand torrents had leaped, but

which was now so dry and white and lifeless that one

could only think of bones bleached and polished by a sun

that had sickened of the work a thousand years ago.
This brief, inadequate description of the Witch's hut

is given in advance of the actual descent of the personally

conducted gentleman for the somewhat ambiguous

reason that he was to find it not at all as described.
The two horsemen rode into the glen and came plump

upon a small detachment of the royal guard, mounted

and rather resolute in their lack of amiability.
"Wot's this?" gasped Mr. Hobbs, drawing rein at the

edge of the pebbly dooryard.
"Soldiers, I'd say," remarked Mr. King, scowling quite

glumly from beneath the rim of his panama. "Hello!"

His eyes brightened and his hat came off with a switch.

"There's the Prince!"
"My word," ejaculated Mr. Hobbs, and forthwith began

to ransack his pockets for the band which said he

was from Cook's.
Farther up the glen, in fact at the very door of the

Witch's hut, were gathered a small but rather distinguished

portion of the royal household. It was not

difficult to recognise the little Prince. He was standing

beside John Tullis; and it is not with a desire to speak ill

of his valour that we add: he was clutching the slackest

part of that gentleman's riding breeks with an earnestness

that betrayed extreme trepidation. Facing them,

on the stone door-step, was the Witch herself, a figure

to try the courage of a time-tried hero, let alone the

susceptibilities of a small boy in knickers. Behind

Tullis and the Prince were several ladies and gentlemen,

all in riding garments and all more or less ill at ease.
Truxton King's heart swelled suddenly; all the world

grew bright again for him. Next to the tall figure of

Colonel Quinnox, of the Royal Guard, was the slim,

entrancing lady of his most recent dreams—the Prince's

aunt! The lady of the grotto! The lady of the goldfish

conspiracy!
The Countess Marlanx, tall and exquisite, was a little

apart from the others, with Baron Dangloss and young

Count Vos Engo—whom Truxton was ready to hate because

he was a recognised suitor for the hand of the slim,

young person in grey. He thought he had liked her

beyond increase in the rajah silk, but now he confessed

to himself that he was mistaken. He liked her better in

a grey riding habit. It struck him sharply, as he sat

there in the saddle, that she would be absolutely and

adorably faultless in point lace or calico, in silk or

gingham, low-neck or high. He was for riding boldly

up to this little group, but a very objectionable lieutenant

barred the way, supported in no small measure

by the defection of Mr. Hobbs, who announced in a

hoarse, agitated whisper that he's "be 'anged if he'd let

any man make a fool of him twice over."
The way was made easy by the intervention of the

alert young woman in grey. She caught sight of the

restricted adventurers—or one of them, to be quite accurate—and,

after speeding a swift smile of astonishment,

turned quickly to Prince Bobby.
A moment later, the tall stranger with the sun-browned

face was the centre of interest to the small

group at the door. He bowed amiably to the smiling

young person in grey and received a quick nod in response.

As he was adventuring what he considered to

be a proper salute for the Prince, he observed that a few

words passed between the lad's aunt and John Tullis,

who was now surveying him with some interest.
The Prince broke the ice.
"Hello!" he cried shrilly, his little face aglow.
"Hello!" responded the gentleman, readily.
John Tullis found himself being dragged away from

the Witch's door toward the newcomer at the bottom of

the glen. Mr. Hobbs listened with deepening awe to the

friendly conversation which resulted in Truxton King

going forward to join the party in front of the hut.

He came along in the rear, after having tethered the

tired horses, not quite sure that he was awake. The

Prince had called him Mr. Cook, had asked him how his

Sons were, all of which was highly gratifying when one

pauses to consider that he had got his cap band on

upside down in his excitement. He always was to wonder

how the little monarch succeeded in reading the title

without standing on his head to do so.
Truxton was duly presented to the ladies and gentlemen

of the party by John Tullis, who gracefully announced

that he knew King's parents in New York.

Baron Dangloss was quite an old friend, if one were to

judge by the manner in which he greeted the young

man. The lady in grey smiled so sweetly and nodded

so blithely, that Tullis, instead of presenting King to

her as he had done to the Countess Marlanx and others,

merely said:
"And you know one another, of course." Whereupon

she flushed very prettily and felt constrained to avoid

Truxton's look of inquiry. He did not lose his wits,

but vowed acquiescence and assumed that he knew.
As a result of the combined supplications of the entire

party, the old woman grudgingly consented to take

them into her hovel, where, in exchange for small pieces

of silver, she would undertake certain manifestations in

necromancy.
Truxton King, scarcely able to believe his good fortune,

crowded into the loathsome, squalid room with his

aristocratic companions, managing, with considerable

skill, to keep close beside his charming friend. They

stood back while the others crowded up to the table

where the hag occupied herself with the crystal ball.
Never had Truxton looked upon a creature who so

thoroughly vindicated the life-long reliance he had put

in the description of witches given by the fairy-tale

tellers of his earliest youth. She had the traditional

hook-nose and peaked chin, the glittering eyes, the thousand

wrinkles and the toothless gums. He looked about

for the raven and the cat, but if she had them, they

were not in evidence. At a rough guess, he calculated

her age at one hundred years. A youth of extreme

laziness, who Baron Dangloss said was the old woman's

grandson, appeared to be her man-of-all-work. He

fetched the old woman's crystal, placed stools for the

visitors, lighted the candles on the table, occupying no

less than a quarter of an hour in performing these

simple acts, so awkward that at least two of his observers

giggled openly and whispered their opinions.
"Gruesome lady, isn't she?" whispered King.
"I shall dream of her for months," whispered the lady

in grey, shuddering.
"Are you willing to have her read your future in that

ball?"
"Do you really think she can tell?"
"I once had a fortune-teller say that I would be married

before I was twenty-three," he informed her. She appeared

interested.
"And were you?"
"No. But she did her part, you know—the fortune-teller,

I mean."
"She warned you. I see. So it really wasn't her

fault." She was watching the preparations at the table

with eager eyes, her lips parted and her breath coming

quick through excitement.
"Would you mind telling me how I am to address you?"

whispered King. They were leaning against the mud-plastered

wall near the little window, side by side. The

whimsical smile that every one loved to see was on his

lips, in his eyes. "You see, I'm a stranger in a strange

land. That accounts for my ignorance."
"You must not speak while she is gazing into the

crystal," she warned, after a quick, searching glance at

his face. He could have sworn that he saw a gleam of

concern in her eyes, followed instantly by a twinkle that

meant mischief.
"Please consider my plight," he implored. "I can't call

you Aunt Loraine, you know."
She laughed silently and turned her head to devote her

entire attention to the scene at the table. Truxton King

was in a sudden state of trepidation. Had he offended

her? There was a hot rush of blood to his ears. He

missed the sly, wondering glance that she gave him out

of the corner of her eye a moment later.
Although it was broad daylight, the low, stuffy room

would have been pitch dark had it not been for the

flickering candles on the table beside the bent, grey head

of the mumbling fortune-teller, whose bony fingers

twitched over and about the crystal globe like wiggling

serpents' tails. The window gave little or no light and

the door was closed, the grinning grandson leaning

against it limply. The picture was a weird, uncanny

one, despite the gay, lightsome appearance of the visitors.

The old woman, in high, shrill tones, had commanded

silence. The men obeyed with a grim scepticism,

while the women seemed really awed by their

surroundings.
The Witch began by reading the fortune of John

Tullis, who had been pushed forward by the wide-eyed

Prince. In a cackling monotone she rambled through a

supposititious history of his past, for the chief part so

unintelligible that even he could not gainsay the statements.

Later, she bent her piercing eyes upon the

Prince and refused to read his future, shrilly asserting

that she had not the courage to tell what might befall

the little ruler, all the while muttering something about

the two little princes who had died in a tower ages and

ages ago. Seeing that the boy was frightened, Tullis

withdrew him to the background. The Countess Marlanx,

who had returned that morning to Edelweiss as

mysteriously as she had left, came next. She was

smiling derisively.
"You have just returned from a visit to some one whom

you hate," began the Witch. "He is your husband. You

will marry again. There is a fair-haired man in love

with you. You are in love with him. I can see

trouble—"
But the Countess deliberately turned away from the

table, her cheeks flaming with the consciousness that a

smile had swept the circle behind her graceful back.
"Ridiculous," she said, and avoided John Tullis's gaze.

"I don't care to hear any more. Come, Baron You

are next."
Truxton King, subdued and troubled in his mind,

found himself studying his surroundings and the people

who went so far to make them interesting. He glanced

from time to time at the delicate, eager profile of the

girl beside him; at the soft, warm cheek and the caressing

brown hair; at the little ear and the white slim neck

of her—and realised just what had happened to him.

He had fallen in love; that was the plain upshot of it.

It had come to pass, just as he had hoped it would in

his dearest dreams. He was face to face with the girl

of royal blood that the story books had created for him

long, long ago, and he was doing just what he had

always intended to do: falling heels over head and hopelessly

in love with her. Never had he seen hair grow

so exquisitely about the temples and neck as this one's

hair—but, just to confound his budding singleness of

interest, his gaze at that instant wandered off and fell

upon something that caused him to stare hard at a

certain spot far removed from the coiffure of a fair and

dainty lady.
His eye had fallen upon a crack in the door that led

to the kitchen, although he had no means of knowing

that it was a kitchen. To his amazement, a gleaming

eye was looking out upon the room from beyond this

narrow crack. He looked long and found that he was

not mistaken. There was an eye, glued close to the

opposite side of the rickety door, and its gaze was

directed to the Countess Marlanx.
The spirit of adventure, recklessness, bravado—whatever

you may choose to call it—flared high in the soul

of this self-despised outsider. He could feel a strange

thrill of exaltation shooting through his veins; he knew

as well as he knew anything that he was destined to

create commotion in that stately crowd, even against

his better judgment. The desire to spring forward and

throw open the door, thus exposing a probable con-

federate, was stronger than he had the power to resist.

Even as he sought vainly to hold himself in check, he

became conscious that the staring eye was meeting his

own in a glare of realisation.
Without pausing to consider the result of his action,

he sprang across the room, shouting as he did so that

there was a man behind the door. Grasping the latch,

he threw the door wide open, the others in the room

looking at him as if he were suddenly crazed.
He had expected to confront the owner of that basilisk

eye. There was not a sign of a human being in sight.

Beyond was a black little room, at the back of which

stood an old cooking stove with a fire going and a

kettle singing. He leaped through, prepared to grasp

the mysterious watcher, but, to his utter amazement, the

kitchen was absolutely empty, save for inanimate things.

His surprise was so genuine that it was not to be mistaken

by the men who leaped to his side. He had time

to note that two of them carried pistols in their hands,

and that Tullis and Quinnox had placed themselves between

the Prince and possible danger.
There was instant commotion, with cries and exclamations

from all. Quick as the others were, the old woman

was at his side before them, snarling with rage. Her

talon-like fingers sunk into his arm, and her gaze went

darting about the room in a most convincing way. Some

minutes passed before the old woman could be quieted.

Then King explained his action. He swore solemnly,

if sheepishly, that he could not have been mistaken,

and yet the owner of that eye had vanished as if swallowed

up by the mountain.
Baron Dangloss was convinced that the young man had

seen the eye. Without compunction he began a search

of the room, the old woman looking on with a grin of

glee.
"Search! Search!" she croaked. "It was the Spirit

Eye! It is looking at you now, my fine baron! It finds

you, yet cannot be found. No, no! Oh, you fools!

Get out! Get out! All of you! Prince or no Prince,

I fear you not, nor all your armies. This is my home!

My castle! Go! Go!"
"There was a man here, old woman," said the Baron

coolly. "Where is he? What is your game? I am

not to be fooled by these damnable tricks of yours.

Where is the man?"
She laughed aloud, a horrid sound. The Prince

clutched Tullis by the leg in terror.
"Brace up, Bobby," whispered his big friend, leaning

down to comfort him. "Be a man!"
"It—it's mighty hard," chattered Bobby, but he

squared his little shoulders.
The ladies of the party had edged forward, peering

into the kitchen, alarm having passed, although the exclamation

"boo!" would have played havoc with their

courage.
"I swear there was some one looking through that

crack," protested King, wiping his brow in confusion.

"Miss—er—I should say—you could have seen it from

where you stood," he pleaded, turning to the lady in

grey.
"Dear me, I wish I had," she cried. "I've always wanted

to see some one snooping."
"There is no window, no trap door, no skylight," remarked

the Baron, puzzled. "Nothing but the stovepipe,

six inches in diameter. A man couldn't crawl out

through that, I'm sure. Mr. King, we've come upon a

real mystery. The eye without a visible body."
"I'm sure I saw it," reiterated Truxton. The Prince's

aunt was actually laughing at him. But so was the

Witch, for that matter. He didn't mind the Witch.
Suddenly the old woman stepped into the middle of the

room and began to wave her hands in a mysterious

manner over an empty pot that stood on the floor in

front of the stove. The others drew back, watching

her with the greatest curiosity.
A droning song oozed from the thin lips; the gesticulations

grew in weirdness and fervor. Then, before their

startled eyes, a thin film of smoke began to rise from the

empty pot. It grew in volume until the room was quite

dense with it. Even more quickly than it began, it disappeared,

drawn apparently by some supernatural agency

into the draft of the stove and out through the rickety

chimney pipe. Even Dangloss blinked his eyes, and not

because they were filled with smoke.
A deafening crash, as of many guns, came to their

ears from the outside. With one accord the entire party

rushed to the outer door, a wild laugh from the hag

pursuing them.
"There!" she screamed. "There goes all there was of

him! And so shall we all go some day. Fire and

smoke!"
Not one there but thought on the instant of the Arabian

nights and the genii who went up in smoke—those

never-to-be-forgotten tales of wonder.
Just outside the door stood Lieutenant Saffo of the

guard, his hand to his cap. He was scarcely distinguishable,

so dark had the day become.
"Good Lord!" shouted Tullis. "What's the matter?

What has happened?"
"The storm, sir," said Saffo. "It is coming down the

valley like the wind." A great crash of thunder burst

overhead and lightning darted through the black, swirling

skies.
"Very sudden, sir," added Mr. Hobbs from behind.

"Like a puff of wind, sir."
The Witch stood in the door behind them, smiling as

amiably as it was possible for her to smile.
"Come in," she said. "There's room for all of you.

The spirits have gone. Ha, ha! My merry man! Even

the eye is gone. Come in, your Highness. Accept the

best I can offer—shelter from the hurricane. I've seen

many, but this looks to be the worst. So it came sudden,

eh? Ha, ha!"
The roar of wind and rain in the trees above seemed

like a howl of confirmation. Into the hovel crowded the

dismayed pleasure-seekers, followed by the soldiers, who

had made the horses fast at the first sign of the storm.
Down came the rain in torrents, whisked and driven,

whirled and shot by the howling winds, split by the

lightning and urged to greater glee by the deafening

applause of the thunder. Apple carts in the skies!
Out in the dooryard the merry grandson of the Witch

was dancing as if possessed by revelling devils.

CHAPTER VIII
LOOKING FOR AN EYE
"Washing the dead men's bones," was the remark King

made a few minutes later. The storm was at its height;

the sheets of rain that swept down the pebbly glen

elicited the gruesome sentence. He stood directly behind

the quaking Loraine, quite close to the open door;

there is no doubt that the observation was intended for

her ears, maliciously or otherwise.
She gave him an awed glance, but no verbal response.

It was readily to be seen that she was terrified by the

violence of the mountain tornado. As if to shame him

for the frivolous remark, she suddenly changed her position,

putting herself behind him.
"I like that," he remonstrated, emboldened by the elements.

"You leave me in front to be struck by the first

bolt of lightning that comes along. And I a stranger,

too."
"Isn't it awful?" she murmured, her fingers in her ears,

her eyes tightly closed. "Do you think we'll be struck?"
"Certainly not," he assured her. "This is a charmed

spot. It's a frolic of her particular devils. She waves

her hand: all the goblins and thunder-workers in this

neck of the woods hustle up to see what's the matter.

Then there's an awful rumpus. In a minute or two

she'll wave her hand and—presto! It will stop raining.

But," with a distressed look out into the thick of it, "it

would be a beastly joke if lightning should happen to

strike that nag of mine. I'd not only have to walk to

town, but I'd have to pay three prices for the brute."
"I think she's perfectly—ooh!—perfectly wonderful.

Goodness, that was a crash! Where do you think it

struck?"
"If you'll stand over here a little closer I'll point out

the tree. See? Right down the ravine there? See the

big limb swaying? That's the place. The old lady is

carrying her joke too far. That's pretty close home.

Stand right there, please. I won't let it rain in on you."
"You are very good, Mr. King. I—I've always

thought I loved a storm. Ooh! But this is too terrible!

Aren't you really afraid you'll be struck? Thanks, ever

so much." He had squared himself between her and the

door, turning his back upon the storm: but not through

cowardice, as one might suppose.
"Don't mention it. I won't mind it so much, don't

you know, if I get struck in the back. How long ago

did you say it was that you went to school with my

sister?"
All this time the Witch was haranguing her huddled

audience, cursing the soldiers, laughing gleefully in the

faces of her stately, scornful guests, greatly to the

irritation of Baron Dangloss, toward whom she showed

an especial attention.
Tullis was holding the Prince in his arms. Colonel

Quinnox stood before them, keeping the babbling, leering

beldame from thrusting her face close to that of the

terrified boy. Young Vos Engo glowered at Truxton

King from the opposite side of the room. Mr. Hobbs

had safely ensconced himself in the rear of the six

guardsmen, who stood near the door, ready to dash forth

if by any chance the terrified horses should succeed in

breaking away.
The Countess Marlanx, pale and rigid, her wondrous

eyes glowing with excitement, stood behind John Tullis,

straight and strong, like a storm spirit glorying in the

havoc that raged about her. Time and again she leaned

forward to utter words of encouragement in the ear of

the little Prince, never without receiving a look of gratitude

and surprise from his tall protector.
And all this time the goose-herd grandson of the Witch

was dancing his wild, uncanny solo in the thick of the

brew, an exalted grin on his face, strange cries of delight

breaking from his lips: a horrid spectacle that fascinated

the observers.
With incredible swiftness the storm passed. Almost

at its height, there came a cessation of the roaring

tempest; the downpour was checked, the thunder died

away and the lightning trickled off into faint flashes.

The sky cleared as if by magic. The exhibition, if you

please, was over!
Even the most stoical, unimpressionable men in the

party looked at each other in bewilderment and—awe,

there was no doubt of it. The glare that Dangloss bent

upon the hag proved that he had been rudely shaken

from his habitual complacency.
"It is the most amazing thing I've ever seen," he said,

over and over again.
The Countess Marlanx was trembling violently. Tullis,

observing this, tried to laugh away her nervousness.
"Mere coincidence, that's all," he said. "Surely you

are not superstitious. You can't believe she brought

about this storm?"
"It isn't that," she said in a low voice. "I feel as if

a grave personal danger had just passed me by. Not

danger for the rest of you, but for me alone. That is

the sensation I have: the feeling of one who has stepped

back from the brink of an abyss just in time to avoid

being pushed over. I can't make you understand. See!

I am trembling. I have seen no more than the rest of

you, yet am more terrified, more upset than Robin, poor

child. Perhaps I am foolish. I know that something

dreadful has—I might say, touched me. Something that

no one else could have seen or felt."
"Nerves, my dear Countess. Shadows! I used to see

them and feel them when I was a lad no bigger than

Bobby if left alone in the dark. It is a grown-up fear

of goblins. You'll be over it as soon as we are outside."
Ten minutes later the cavalcade started down the rain-swept

road toward the city, dry blankets having been

placed across the saddles occupied by the ladies and the

Prince. The Witch stood in her doorway, laughing

gleefully, inviting them to come often.
"Come again, your Highness," she croaked sarcastically.
"The next time I come, it will be with a torch to burn

you alive!" shouted back Dangloss. To Tullis he added:

"'Gad, sir, they did well to burn witches in your town

of Salem. You cleared the country of them, the pests."
Darkness was approaching fast among the sombre

hills; the great pass was enveloped in the mists and the

gloaming of early night. In a compact body the

guardsmen rode close about Prince Robin and his friend.

Ingomede had urged this upon Tullis, still oppressed by

the feeling of disaster that had come over her in the

hovel.
"It means something, my friend, it means something,"

she insisted. "I feel it—I am sure of it." Riding quite

close beside him, she added in lower tones: "I was with

my husband no longer ago than yesterday. Do you

know that I believe it is Count Marlanx that I feel

everywhere about me now? He—his presence—is in the

air! Oh, I wish I could make you feel as I do."
"You haven't told me why you ran away on Sunday,"

he said, abruptly, dismissing her argument with small

ceremony.
"He sent for me. I—I had to go." There was a new,

strange expression in her eyes that puzzled him for a

long time. Suddenly the solution came: she was completely

captive to the will of this hated husband. The

realisation brought a distinct, sickening shock with it.
Down through the lowering shades rode the Prince's

party, swiftly, even gaily by virtue of relaxation from

the strain of a weird half hour. No one revealed the

slightest sign of apprehension arising from the mysterious

demonstration in which nature had taken a hand.
Truxton King was holding forth, with cynical good

humour, for the benefit, if not the edification of Baron

Dangloss, with whom he rode—Mr. Hobbs galloping behind

not unlike the faithful Sancho of another Quixote's

day.
"It's all tommy-rot, Baron," said Truxton. "We've

got a dozen stage wizards in New York who can do all

she did and then some. That smoke from the kettle is

a corking good trick—but that's all it is, take my word

for it. The storm? Why, you know as well as I do,

Baron, that she can't bring rain like that. If she could,

they'd have her over in the United States right now,

saving the crops, with or without water. That was

chance. Hobbs told me this morning it looked like rain.

By the way, I must apologise to him. I said he was

a crazy kill-joy. The thing that puzzles me is what

became of the owner of that eye. I'll stake my life on

it, I saw an eye. 'Gad, it looked right into mine.

Queerest feeling it gave me."
"Ah, that's it, my young friend. What became of the

eye? Poof! And it is gone. We searched immediately.

No sign. It is most extraordinary."
"I'll admit it's rather gruesome, but—I say, do you

know I've a mind to look into that matter if you don't

object, Baron. It's a game of some sort. She's a

wily old dame, but I think if we go about it right we

can catch her napping and expose the whole game. I'm

going back there in a day or two and try to get at the

bottom of it. That confounded eye worries me. She's

laughing up her sleeve at us, too, you know."
"I should advise you to keep away from her, my friend.

Granted she has tricked us: why not? It is her trade.

She does no harm—except that she's most offensively

impudent. And I rather imagine she'll resent your

investigation, if you attempt it. I can't say that I'd

blame her." The Baron laughed.
"Baron, it struck me a bit shivery at the time, but I

want to say to you now that the eye that I saw at the

crack was not that of an idle peeper, nor was it a mere

fakir's substitute. It was as malevolent as the devil and

it glared—do you understand? Glared! It didn't

peep!"
Truxton King, for reasons best known to himself, soon

relapsed into a thoughtful, contemplative silence. Between

us, he was sorely vexed and disappointed. When

the gallant start was made from the glen of "dead

men's bones," he found that he was to be cast utterly

aside, quite completely ignored by the fair Loraine. She

rode off with young Count Vos Engo without so much

as a friendly wave of the hand to him. He said it over

to himself several times: "not even a friendly wave of

her hand." It was as if she had forgotten his existence,

or—merciful Powers! What was worse—as if she took

this way of showing him his place. Of course, that being

her attitude, he glumly found his place—which

turned out rather ironically to be under the eye of a

police officer—and made up his mind that he would stay

there.
Vos Engo, being an officer in the Royal Guard, rode

ahead by order of Colonel Quinnox. Truxton, therefore,

had her back in view—at rather a vexing distance, too—for

mile after mile of the ride to the city. Not so far

ahead, however, that he could not observe every movement

of her light, graceful figure as she swept down the King's

Highway. She was a perfect horsewoman, firm, jaunty,

free. Somehow he knew, without seeing, that a stray

brown wisp of hair caressed her face with insistent

adoration: he could see her hand go up from time to

time to brush it back—just as if it were not a happy

place for a wisp of hair. Perhaps—he shivered with

the thought of it—perhaps it even caressed her lips.

Ah, who would not be a wisp of brown hair!
He galloped along beside the Baron, a prey to gloomy

considerations. What was the use? He had no chance

to win her. That was for story-books and plays. She

belonged to another world—far above his. And even

beyond that, she was not likely to be attracted by such

a rude, ungainly, sunburned lout as he, with such chaps

about as Vos Engo, or that what's-his-name fellow, or

a dozen others whom he had seen. Confound it all, she

was meant for a prince, or an archduke. What chance

had he?
But she was the loveliest creature he had ever seen.

Yes; she was the golden girl of his dreams. Within

his grasp, so to speak, and yet he could not hope to seize

her, after all. Was she meant for that popinjay youth

with the petulant eye and the sullen jaw? Was he to

be the lucky man, this Vos Engo?
The Baron's dry, insinuating voice broke in upon the

young man's thoughts. "I think it's pretty well understood

that she's going to marry him." The little old

minister had been reading King's thoughts; he had the

satisfaction of seeing his victim start guiltily. It was

on the tip of Truxton's tongue to blurt out: "How the

devil did you know what I was thinking about?" But

he managed to control himself, asking instead, with

bland interest:
"Indeed? Is it a good match, Baron?"
The Baron smiled. "I think so. He has been a trifle

wild, but I believe he has settled down. Splendid family.

He is desperately in love, as you may have noted."
"I hadn't thought much about it. Is she in love with

him?"
"She sees a great deal of him," was the diplomatic

answer.
Truxton considered well for a minute or two, and then

bluntly asked:
"Would you mind telling me just who she is, Baron?

What is her name?"
Dangloss was truly startled. He gave the young man

a quick, penetrating glance; then a set, hard expression

came into his eyes.
"Do you mean, sir, that you don't know her?" he asked,

almost harshly.
"I don't know her name."
"And you had the effrontery to—My excellent friend,

you amaze me. I can't believe it of you. Why, sir,

how dare you say this to me? I know that Americans

are bold, but, by gad, sir, I've always looked upon them

as gentlemen. You—"
"Hold on, Baron Dangloss," interrupted Truxton, very

red in the face. "Don't say it, please. You'd better

hear my side of the story first. She went to school with

my sister. She knows me, but, confound it, sir, she refuses

to tell me who she is. Do you think that is fair?

Now, I'll tell you how it came about." He related the

story of the goldfish and the pinhook. The Baron

smiled comfortably to himself, a sphinx-like expression

coming into his beady eyes as he stared steadily on

ahead; her trim grey back seemed to encourage his admiring

smile.
"Well, my boy, if she elects to keep you in the dark

concerning her name, it is not for me to betray her,"

he said at the end of the recital. "Ladies in her position,

I dare say, enjoy these little mysteries. If she

wants you to know, she'll tell you. Perhaps it would be

well for you to be properly, officially presented to her

hi—to the young lady. Your countryman, Mr. Tullis,

will be glad to do so, I fancy. But let me suggest:

don't permit your ingenuousness to get the better of

you again. She's having sport with you on account

of it. We all know her propensities."
It was dusk when they entered the northern gates.

Above the Castle, King said good-bye to Tullis and the

Countess, gravely saluted the sleepy Prince, and followed

Mr. Hobbs off to the heart of the city. He was hot

with resentment. Either she had forgotten to say good-bye

to him or had wilfully decided to ignore him altogether;

at any rate, she entered the gates to the Castle

grounds without so much as an indifferent glance in his

direction.
Truxton knew in advance that he was to have a sleepless,

unhappy night.
In his room at the hotel he found the second anonymous

letter, unquestionably from the same source, but this

time printed in crude, stilted letters. It had been stuck

under the door, together with some letters that had been

forwarded from Teheran.
"Leave the city at once. You are in great danger.

Save yourself!"
This time he did not laugh. That it was from Olga

Platanova he made no doubt. But why she should

interest herself so persistently in his welfare was quite

beyond him, knowing as he did that in no sense had he

appealed to her susceptibility. And what, after all,

could she mean by "great danger"? "Save yourself!"

He sat for a long time considering the situation. At

last he struck the window sill a resounding thwack with

his fist and announced his decision to the silent, disinterested

wall opposite.
"I'll take her advice. I'll get out. Not because I'm

afraid to stay, but because there's no use. She's got

no eyes for me. I'm a plain impossibility so far as she's

concerned. It's Vos Engo—damn little rat! Old

Dangloss came within an ace of speaking of her as 'her

Highness.' That's enough for me. That means she's

a princess. It's all very nice in novels, but in real life

men don't go about picking up any princess they happen

to like. No, sir! I might just as well get out while I

can. She treated me as if I were a yellow dog to-day—after

I'd been damned agreeable to her, too, standing

between her and the lightning. I might have been

struck. I wonder if she would have been grateful. No;

she wouldn't. She'd have smiled her sweetest, and said:

"wasn't it lucky?"
He picked up the note once more. "If I were a storybook

hero, I'd stick this thing in my pocket and set out

by myself to unravel the mystery behind it. But I've

chucked the hero job for good and all. I'm going to

hand this over to Dangloss. It's the sensible thing to

do, even if it isn't what a would-be hero in search of a

princess aught to do. What's more, I'll hunt the Baron

up this very hour. Hope it doesn't get Olga into

trouble."
He indulged in another long spell of thoughtfulness.

"No, by George, I'll not turn tail at the first sign of

danger. I'll stay here and assist Dangloss in unravelling

this matter. And I'll go up to that Witch's

hole before I'm a day older to have it out with her. I'll

find out where the smoke came from and I'll know where

that eye went to." He sighed without knowing it. "By

Jove, I'd like to do something to show her I'm not the

blooming duffer she thinks I am."
He could not find Baron Dangloss that night, nor early

the next day. Hobbs, after being stigmatised as the

only British coward in the world, changed his mind and

made ready to accompany King to the hovel in Ganlook

Gap.
By noon the streets in the vicinity of the Plaza were

filled with strange, rough-looking men, undeniably

labourers.
"Who are they?" demanded King, as they rode past a

particularly sullen, forbidding crowd at the corner below

the city hail.
"There's a strike on among the men who are building

the railroad," said Hobbs. "Ugly looking crowd, eh?"
"A strike? 'Gad, it's positively homelike."
"I heard a bit ago that the matter has been adjusted.

They go back to work to-morrow, slight increase in

pay and a big decrease in work. They were to have

had their answer to-day. Mr. Tullis, I hear, was instrumental

in having the business settled without a row."
"They'd better look out for these fellows," said King,

very soberly. "I don't like the appearance of 'em. They

look like cut-throats."
"Take my word for it, sir, they are. They're the riff-raff

of all Europe. You should have seen them of a

Sunday, sir, before the order went out closing the

drinking places on that day. My word, they took the

town. There was no living here for the decent people.

Women couldn't go out of their houses."
"I hope Baron Dangloss knows how to handle them?"

in some anxiety. "By the way, remind me to look up

the Baron just as soon as we get back to town this

evening."
"If we ever get back!" muttered the unhappy Mr.

Hobbs. Prophetic lamentation!
In due time they rode into the sombre solitudes of

Ganlook Gap and up to the Witch's glen. Here Mr.

Hobbs balked. He refused to adventure farther than

the mouth of the stony ravine. Truxton approached

the hovel alone, without the slightest trepidation. The

goose-herd grandson was driving a flock of geese across

the green bowl below the cabin. The American called

out to him and a moment later the youth, considerably

excited, drove his geese up to the door. He could understand

no English, nor could Truxton make out what he

was saying in the native tongue. While they were

vainly haranguing each other the old woman appeared

at the edge of the thicket above the hut. Uttering

shrill exclamations, she hurried down to confront King

with blazing eyes. He fell back, momentarily dismayed.

Her horrid grin of derision brought a flush to his cheek;

he faced her quite coolly.
"I'll lay you a hundred gavvos that the kettle and

smoke experiment is a fake of the worst sort," he announced,

after a somewhat lengthy appeal to be allowed

to enter the hut as a simple seeker after knowledge.
"Have it your own way! Have it your own way!" she

cackled.
"Tell you what I'll do; if I can't expose that trick in

ten minutes, I'll make you a present of a hundred gavvos."
She took him up like a flash, a fact which startled and

disconcerted him not a little. Her very eagerness

augured ill for his proposition. Still, he was in for it;

he was determined to get inside the hut and solve the

mystery, if it were possible. Exposure of the Witch

would at least attract the interest if not the approval

of a certain young lady in purple and fine linen. That

was surely worth while.
With a low, mocking bow, the shrivelled hag stood aside

and motioned for him to precede her into the hovel. He

looked back at Mr. Hobbs. That gentleman's eyes

seemed to be starting from his head.
"A hundred gavvos is a fortune not easily to be won,"

said the old dame. "How can I be sure that you will

pay me if you lose?"
"It is in my pocket, madam. If I don't pay, you may

instruct your excellent grandson to crack me over the

head. He looks as though he'd do it for a good deal

less money, I'll say that for him."
"He is honest—as honest as his grandmother," cried the

old woman. She bestowed a toothless grin upon him.

"Now what is it you want to do?"
They were standing in the centre of the wretched

living-room. The goose-boy was in the door, looking

on with strangely alert, questioning eyes, ever and anon

peering over his shoulder toward the spot where Hobbs

stood with the horses. He seldom took his gaze from the

face of the old woman, a rat-like smile touching the

corners of his fuzz-lined lips.
"I want to go through that kitchen, just to satisfy

myself of one or two things." King was looking hard

at the crack in the kitchen door. Suddenly he started

as if shot.
The staring, burning eye was again looking straight

at him from the jagged crack in the door!
"I'll get you this time," he shouted, crossing the room

in two eager leaps. The door responded instantly to

his violent clutch, swung open with a bang, and disclosed

the interior of the queer little kitchen.
The owner of that mocking, phantom eye was gone!
Like a frantic dog, Truxton dashed about the little

kitchen, looking in every corner, every crack for signs

of the thing he chased. At last he paused, baffled,

mystified. The old woman was standing in the middle

of the outer room, grinning at him with what was

meant for complacency, but which struck him at once as

genuine malevolence.
"Ha, ha!" she croaked. "You fool! You fool!

Search! Smell him out! All the good it will do you!

Ha, ha!"
"By gad, I will get at the bottom of this!" shouted

Truxton, stubborn rage possessing him. "There's some

one here, and I know it. I'm not such a fool as to believe—Say!

What's that? The ceiling! By the eternal,

that scraping noise explains it! There's where the

secret trap-door is—in the ceiling! Within arm's

reach, at that! Watch me, old woman! I'll have your

spry friend out of his nest in the shake of a lamb's tail."
The hag was standing in the kitchen door now, still

grinning evilly. She watched the eager young man

pound upon the low ceiling with a three-legged stool

that he had seized from the floor.
"I don't see how he got up there so quickly, though.

He must be like greased lightning."
He was pounding vigorously on the roughly boarded

ceiling when the sharp voice of the old woman, raised in

command, caused him to lower the stool and turn upon

her with gleaming, triumphant eyes. The look he saw

in her face was sufficient to check his enterprise for the

moment. He dropped the stool and started toward her,

his arms extended to catch her swaying form. The

look of the dying was in her eyes; she seemed to be

crumpling before him.
He reached her in time, his strong arms grasping the

frail, bent figure as it sank to the floor. As he lifted

her bodily from her feet, intent upon carrying her to

the open air, her bony fingers sank into his arm with

the grip of death, and—could he believe his ears!—a

low, mocking laugh came from her lips.
Down where the pebbly house-yard merged into the

mossy banks, Mr. Hobbs sat tight, still staring with

gloomy eyes at the dark little hut up the glen. His

sturdy knees were pressing the skirts of the saddle

with a firmness that left no room for doubt as to the

tension his nerves were under. Now and then he murmured

"My word!" but in what connection it is doubtful

if even he could tell. A quarter of an hour had passed

since King disappeared through the doorway: Mr.

Hobbs was getting nervous.
The shiftless, lanky goose-herd came forth in time, and

lazily drove his scattered flock off into the lower glen.
The horses were becoming impatient. To his extreme

discomfort, not to say apprehension, they were constantly

pricking their ears forward and snorting in the

direction of the hovel; a very puzzling circumstance,

thought Mr. Hobbs. At this point he began to say

"dammit," and with some sense of appreciation, too.
Presently his eye caught sight of a thin stream of

smoke, rather black than blue, arising from the little

chimney at the rear of the cabin. His eyes flew very

wide open; his heart experienced a sudden throbless

moment; his mind leaped backward to the unexplained

smoke mystery of the day before. It was on the end

of his tongue to cry out to his unseen patron, to urge

him to leave the Witch to her deviltry and come along

home, when the old woman herself appeared in the doorway—alone.
She sat down upon the doorstep, pulling away at a long

pipe, her hooded face almost invisible from the distance

which he resolutely held. He felt that she was eyeing

him with grim interest. For a few minutes he waited,

a sickening doubt growing up in his soul. A single

glance showed him that the chimney was no longer emitting

smoke. It seemed to him that the old woman was

losing all semblance of life. She was no more than a

black, inanimate heap of rags piled against the door-jamb.
Hobbs let out a shout. The horses plunged viciously.

Slowly the bundle of rags took shape. The old woman

arose and hobbled toward him, leaning upon a great

cane.
"Whe—where's Mr. King?" called out Hobbs.
She stopped above him and he could see her face. Mr.

Hobbs was chilled to the bone. Her arm was raised, a

bony finger pointing to the treetops above her hovel.
"He's gone. Didn't you see him? He went off among

the treetops. You won't see him again." She waited a

moment, and then went on, in most ingratiating tones:

"Would you care to come into my house? I can show

you the road he took. You—"
But Mr. Hobbs, his hair on end, had dropped the

rein of King's horse and was putting boot to his own

beast, whirling frantically into the path that led away

from the hated, damned spot! Down the road he

crashed, pursued by witches whose persistence put to

shame the efforts of those famed ladies of Tam

O'Shanter in the long ago; if he had looked over his

shoulder, he might have discovered that he was followed

by a riderless horse, nothing more.
But a riderless horse is a gruesome thing—sometimes.

CHAPTER IX
STRANGE DISAPPEARANCES
The further adventures of Mr. Hobbs on this memorable

afternoon are quickly chronicled, notwithstanding

the fact that he lived an age while they were transpiring,

and experienced sensations that would still be fresh in

his memory if he lived to be a hundred.
He was scarcely well out of sight of the cabin when his

conscience began to smite him: after all, his patron

might be in dire need of his services, and here he was,

fleeing from an old woman and a whiff of smoke! Hobbs

was not a physical coward, but it took more than a mile

of hard-ridden conscience to bring his horse to a standstill.

Then, with his heart in his mouth, he slowly began

to retrace his steps, walking where he had galloped a

moment before. A turn in the road brought him in

view of something that caused him to draw rein sharply.

A hundred yards ahead, five or six men were struggling

with a riderless bay horse.
"My Gawd!" ejaculated Hobbs. "It's his horse! I

might have known!"
He looked eagerly for his patron. There was no sign

of him, so Hobbs rode slowly forward, intent upon asking

the woodmen—for such they appeared to be—to

accompany him to the glen, now but a short distance

ahead.
As he drew nearer, it struck him forcibly that the men

were not what he had thought them to be. They were

an evil-looking lot, more like the strikers he had seen in

the town earlier in the day. Even as he was turning

the new thought over in his mind, one of them stepped

out of the little knot, and, without a word of warning,

lifted his arm and fired point blank at the little Englishman.

A pistol ball whizzed close by his head. His

horse leaped to the side of the road in terror, almost unseating

him.
But Hobbs had fighting blood in his veins. What is

more to the point, he had a Mauser revolver in his

pocket. He jerked it out, and, despite a second shot

from the picket, prepared to ride down upon the party.

An instant later half a dozen revolvers were blazing

away at him. Hobbs turned at once and rode in the

opposite direction, whirling to fire twice at the unfriendly

group. Soon he was out of range and at

leisure. He saw the futility of any attempt to pass

them. The only thing left for him to do was to ride

as quickly as possible to the city and give the alarm: at

the same time, to acquaint the police with the deliberate

assault of the desperadoes.
His mind was so full of the disaster to Truxton King—he

did not doubt for an instant that he had been

destroyed by the sorceress—that he gave little thought

to his own encounter with the rascals in the roadway.

He had come to like the impetuous young man with the

open purse and the open heart. Despite his waywardness

in matters conventional to the last degree he could

not but admire him for the smile he had and the courage

that never failed him, even when the smile met the frown

of rebuke.
Riding swiftly through the narrow, sunless defile he

was nearing the point where the road connected with

the open Highway; from there on the way was easy and

devoid of peril. Suddenly his horse swerved and leaped

furiously out of stride, stumbling, but recovering himself

almost instantaneously. In the same second he heard

the sharp crack of a firearm, far down the unbroken

ravine to his left. A second shot came, this time from

the right and quite close at hand. His horse was staggering,

swaying—then down he crashed, Hobbs swinging

clear barely in time to escape being pinioned to the

ground. A stream of blood was pouring from the side

of the poor beast. Aghast at this unheard of wantonness,

the little interpreter knew not which way to turn,

but stood there dazed until a third shot brought him to

his senses. The bullet kicked up the dust near his feet.

He scrambled for the heavy underbrush at the roadside

and darted off into the forest, his revolver in his hand,

his heart palpitating like mad. Time and again as he

fled through the dark thickets, he heard the hoarse

shouts of men in the distance. It dawned upon him at

last that there had been an uprising of some kind in the

city—that there was rioting and murder going on—that

these men were not ordinary bandits, but desperate

strikers in quest of satisfaction for grievances ignored.
Night came and he dropped to the soft, dank earth,

utterly exhausted and absolutely lost for the time being

in the pathless hills.
At ten o'clock the next morning Colonel Quinnox and

a company of soldiers, riding from the city gates toward

the north in response to a call for help from honest

herders who reported attacks and robberies of an alarming

nature, came upon the stiff, foot-sore, thorn-scratched

Mr. Hobbs, not far from the walls of the

town. The Colonel was not long in grasping the substance

of Hobbs's revelations. He rode off at once for

the Witch's hovel, sending Hobbs with a small, instructed

escort to the Castle, where Baron Dangloss was

in consultation with Mr. Tullis and certain ministers.
The city was peaceful enough, much to the surprise of

Hobbs. No disturbance had been reported, said the

guardsmen who rode beside him. Up in the hills there

had been some depredations, but that was all.
"All?" groaned Mr. Hobbs. "All? Hang it all, man,

wot do you call all? You haven't heard 'alf all of it

yet. I tell you, there's been the devil to pay. Wait till

the Colonel comes back from Ganlook Gap. He'll have

news for you; take it from me, he will. That poor chap

'as gone up in smoke, as sure as my name's Hobbs."
They met Baron Dangloss near the barracks, across the

park from the Castle. He was in close, earnest conversation

with John Tullis and Count Halfont, both of whom

seemed to be labouring under intense excitement. Over

by the arsenal the little Prince, attended by his Aunt

Loraine and Count Vos Engo—with two mechanical

guardsmen in the background—was deep in conversation

with Julius Spantz, the master-of-arms. If he had

been near enough to hear, he might have learned that

Prince Robin's air-gun was very much out of order and

needed attention at once.
The arrival of Hobbs, a pitiful but heroic object, at

once arrested the attention of every one. His story was

heard by a most distinguished audience; in fact, Hobbs

was near to exploding with his own suddenly acquired importance.

Not only were there dark, serious looks from

the men in the party, and distressed exclamations from

the most beautiful young lady in the world (he had

always said that of her), but he had the extreme unction

of bringing tears to the eyes of a prince, and of

hearing manfully suppressed sobs from the throat of the

same august personage.
The looks that went round at the conclusion of his

disjointed and oft-interrupted story, expressed something

more than consternation.
"There is nothing supernatural about King's disappearance,"

said Tullis sharply. "That's all nonsense.

He had money about him and it perhaps turns out that

there really was a man at the crack in the door—a

clever brigand who to-day has got the better of our

vain-glorious friend. The shooting in the hills is more

disturbing than this, to my mind. Gentlemen, you

shouldn't lose any time in running these fellows down.

It will mean trouble if it gets under way. They're an

ugly lot."
"This mystery coming on top of the other is all the

more difficult to understand. I mean the disappearance

of the Countess Marlanx," said Baron Dangloss, pulling

at his imperial in plain perplexity. "But we must not

stop here talking. Will you come with me, Mr. Tullis,

to the Tower? I shall send out my best man to work on

the case of the lady. It is a most amazing thing. I

still have hope that she will appear in person to explain

the affair."
"I think not," said Tullis gloomily. "This looks like

abduction-foul play, or whatever you choose to call it.

She has never left her father's house in just this manner

before. I believe, Baron, that Marlanx has taken her

away by force. She told me yesterday that she would

never go back to him if she could help it. I have already

given you my suspicions regarding his designs

upon the—ahem!" Catching the eager gaze of the

Prince, he changed the word "throne" to "treasury."

The Baron nodded thoughtfully. "The Countess attended

the fête at Baron Pultz's last night, leaving at

twelve o'clock. I said good-night to her at the fountain

and watched her until she passed through the gate

between the Baron's grounds and those of her father adjoining.

She would not permit me to accompany her

to the doors. Her maid had preceded her and was waiting

just beyond the gate—at least, so she says to-day.

It is less than two hundred feet from the gate to Perse's

doorsteps. Well, she never crossed that space. Her

maid waited for an hour near the fernery and then came

to the Baron's. The Countess has not been seen since

she passed through the gate in the wall. I say that she

has been carried away."
"The maid will be at my office at eleven with the Duke

of Perse and the house servants. I have detailed a man

to look up this fellow Brutus you speak of, and to ascertain

his whereabouts last night. Come, we will go

to the Tower. The Duke is greatly distressed. He

suspects foul play, I am confident, but he will not admit

that Marlanx is responsible."
"But what about Mr. King?" piped up a small voice.
"Colonel Quinnox has gone to look for him, Bobby,"

began Tullis, frowning slightly. He was interested in

but one human being at that moment.
"I want the old Witch beheaded," said the Prince.

"Why don't you go, Uncle Jack? He's an American.

He'd help you, I bet, if you were in danger."
Tullis flushed. Then he patted Prince Robin's shoulder

and said, with no little emotion in his voice:
"Perhaps I deserve the rebuke, Bobby, but you must

not forget that there is a lady in distress. Which would

you have me do—desert the lady whom we all love or

the man whom we scarcely know?"
"The lady," said Bobby promptly. "Hasn't she got a

husband to look after her? Mr. King has no friends,

no relations, nothing. Aunt Loraine likes him and so

do I."
"He's a fine chap," asserted Hobbs, and afterward

marvelled at his own temerity.
Loraine, her merry eyes now dark with anxiety, her

cheeks white with resolution, turned upon John Tullis.

"You might leave the rescue of the Countess to the

proper authorities—the police," she said calmly. "I

think it is your duty as an American to head the search

for Mr. King. If Count Marlanx has spirited his wife

away, pray, who has a better right?"
"But we are not sure that he—"
"We are sure that Mr. King is either dead or in dire

need of help," she interrupted hotly. He looked at her

in surprise, swayed by two impulses.
"Colonel Quinnox is quite competent to conduct the

search," he said shortly.
"But Colonel Quinnox has gone forth on another mission.

He may be unable to give any of his time to the

search for Mr. King. It is outrageous, John Tullis, to

refuse help—"
"I don't refuse help," he exclaimed. "They may take

the whole army out to look for him, so far as I am concerned.

But, I'll tell you this—I consider it my duty

as a man to devote what strength I have to the service of

a woman in trouble. That ends it! Come, Baron; we

will go to the Tower."
The amazed young woman looked at him with wide,

comprehending eyes. Her lip trembled under the rebuke.

Count Halfont intervened, hastily proposing that a

second party be sent out at once with instructions to

raze the Witch's hut if necessary.
"I shall be happy to lead the expedition," said young

Count Vos Engo, bowing deeply to the young lady herself.
"You shall, Vos Engo," said Halfont. "Prepare at

once. Take ten men. I shall report to General Braze

for you."
Tullis turned suddenly to the resentful girl. "Loraine,"

he said gently, as the others drew away, "don't be hard

with me. You don't understand."
"Yes, I do," she said stubbornly. "You are in love

with her."
"Yes; that's quite true."
"A married woman!"
"I can't help it. I must do all I can for her."
She looked into his honest eyes for a moment.
"Forgive me," she murmured, hanging her head.

"What is Mr. King to us, after all?"
"He is simply paying for his foolhardiness. Americans

do that the world over."
"Be careful that you do not pay for something worse

than foolhardiness."
"I think you may trust me."
She smiled brightly up into his face. "Have your

way, then. Remember that I am her friend, too." Then

she hurried off after the Prince and Vos Engo, who was

already giving instructions to an attentive orderly.
"Poor Mr. King!" she said to the Prince, as they stood

by watching the preparations. "I am afraid, Bobby,

he can't come to your circus this week. I sent the invitation

this morning, early. He may never receive it.

Isn't it dreadful, Count Vos Engo?"
Count Vos Engo was politely concerned, but it should

not be expected that, in his present state of mind regarding

her, he could be seriously grieved by anything

that might have happened to the rash American.
The guard about the Prince was doubled: orders requiring

the strictest care of his person were issued by

Count Halfont. By this time, it may be suspected, the

suspicions of John Tullis had been communicated to men

high in the government; no small amount of credence

was attached to them. Baron Dangloss began to see

things in a different light; things that had puzzled him

before now seemed clear. His office was the busiest place

in Edelweiss.
"It is not unreasonable to suspect that Marlanx, or

some of his agents, having concluded that the Countess

knew too much of their operations, and might not be a

safe repository, decided to remove her before it was too

late. Understand, gentlemen, I don't believe the Countess

is in sympathy with her husband's schemes—"
The Duke of Perse interrupted the doughty baron.

"You assume a great deal, Baron, in saying that he has

schemes inimical to the best interests of this country."
"I fancy that your Grace will admit that your venerable

son-in-law—who, if I mistake not, is some ten years

your senior—has no great love for the reigning power

in Graustark. We will pass that, however," said the

Baron, pointedly. "We should be wise enough to guard

against any move he may make; it is imperative that we

should not be caught napping."
"I don't believe he has taken my daughter away by

force. Why should he do so? She goes to him voluntarily

at the end of each visit. There is no coercion."

He met John Tullis's stony gaze without flinching. "I

insist that she has been stolen by these brigands in the

hills, to be held for ransom."
The stories of the maid, the footmen, the groundmen

were all to the effect that the Countess had not returned

to her father's home after leaving the fête next door.

There were no signs of a struggle in the garden, nor

had there been the slightest noise to attract the attention

of the waiting maid. It was not impossible, after all,

that she had slipped away of her own accord, possessed

of a sudden whim or impulse.
The new man-servant, suspected by the Countess herself,

passed through the examination creditably. Tullis,

of course, had not yet told Dangloss of the Countess's

own suspicions concerning this man. They were a part of

their joint secret. The American felt sure, however,

that this man knew more of the night's work than he

had told. He conveyed this belief to Dangloss, and a

close watch was set upon the fellow. More than once

during the long afternoon John Tullis found himself

wishing that he had that dare-devil, thoroughbred young

countryman of his, Truxton King, beside him; something

told him that the young man would prove a

treasure in resourcefulness and activity.
Late in the afternoon, a telegram was brought to Tullis

which upset all of their calculations and caused the

minister of police to swear softly in pure disgust. It

was from the Countess Marlanx herself, sent from

Porvrak, a station far down the railway, in the direction

of Vienna. It was self-explanatory: "I am going to

Schloss Marlanx, there to end my days. There is no

hope for me. I go voluntarily. Will you not understand

why I am leaving Edelweiss? You must know." It was

signed "Ingomede."
Tullis was dumbfounded. He caught the penetrating

glance of Dangloss and flushed under the sudden knowledge

that this shrewd old man also understood why she

was leaving Edelweiss. Because of him! Because she

loved him and would not be near him. His heart swelled

exultantly in the next moment; a brave resolve was born

within him.
"We don't need a key to that, my boy," said the Baron

indulgently. "But I will say that she has damned little

consideration for you when she steals away in the dead

of night, without a word. In a ball dress, too. Unfeeling,

I'd say. Well, we can devote our attention to

Mr. King, who is lost."
"See here, Baron," said Tullis after a moment, "I want

you to give me a couple of good men for a few days.

I'm going to Schloss Marlanx. I'll get her away from

that place if I have to kill Marlanx and swing for it."
At seven o'clock that night, accompanied by two clever

secret service men, Tullis boarded the train for the

West. A man who stood in the tobacconist's shop on

the station platform smiled quietly to himself as the

train pulled out. Then he walked briskly away. It was

Peter Brutus, the lawyer.
A most alluring trap had been set for John Tullis!
The party that had gone to Ganlook Gap in charge of

Count Vos Engo returned at nightfall, no wiser than

when it left the barracks at noon. Riding bravely, but

somewhat dejectedly beside the handsome young officer

in command was a girl in grey. It was her presence with

the troop that had created comment at the gates earlier

in the day. No one could understand why she was riding

forth upon what looked to be a dangerous mission. Least

of all, Count Vos Engo, who had striven vainly to dissuade

her from the purpose to accompany the soldiers.
Now she was coming home with them, silent, subdued,

dispirited—even more so than she allowed the Count to

see.
"I was hateful to him yesterday," she said penitently,

as they rode into the city. Vos Engo had been thinking

of something else: the remark disturbed him.
"He was very presumptuous-yesterday," he said

crossly.
She transfixed him with a look meant to be reproachful.
"That's why I managed the ticket for Bobby's circus,"

she said, looking ahead with a genuinely mournful droop

of her lip. "I was sorry for him. Oh, dear, oh, dear

What will his poor mother say—and his sister?"
"We've done all we can, Loraine. Except to cable,"

he added sourly.
"Yes, I suppose so. Poor fellow!"
Colonel Quinnox and his men had been scouring the

hills for bandits. They arrived at the Witch's cabin a

few minutes after Vos Engo and his company. Disregarding

the curses of the old woman, a thorough

search of the place was made. The forest, the ravine,

the mountainside for a mile or more in all directions were

gone over by the searchers. There was absolutely no

sign of the missing man, nor was there the least indication

that there had been foul play.
The old woman's story, reflected by the grandson, was

convincing so far as it went. She said that the young

man remained behind in the kitchen to puzzle himself

over the smoke mystery, while she went out to her doorstep.

The man with the horses became frightened when

she went down to explain the situation to him. He fled.

A few minutes later the gentleman emerged, to find his

horse gone, himself deserted. Cursing, he struck off

down the glen in pursuit of his friend, and that was the

last she saw of him. Not long afterward she heard shooting

in the Gap and sent her grandson to see if anything

could have happened to her late visitor, who, it seems,

owed her one hundred gavvos as a forfeit of some sort.


"Bobby! Don't be foolish. How could I be in love

with him?"


The further prosecution of the search was left to

Colonel Quinnox and his men. Loraine, shuddering, but

resolute, had witnessed the ransacking of the hut, had

urged the arrest of the hag, and had come away disheartened

but satisfied that the woman had told them

the truth. Quinnox's theory was accepted by all. He

believed that King had fallen into the hands of brigands

and that a heavy ransom would be demanded for his

release.
In a warm-tinted room at the Castle, later on in the

evening, the Prince, in pajamas, was discoursing

bravely on the idiosyncrasies of Fate. His only auditor

was the mournful Loraine, who sat beside the royal

bed in which he wriggled vaguely. The attendants were

far down the room.
"Never mind, Aunt Loraine, you can't help it. I'm

just as sorry as you are. Say, are you in love with

him?"
"In love with whom?"
"Mr. King."
"Of course not, silly. What an absurd question. I do

not know him at all."
"That's all right, Aunt Loraine. I believe in love at

first sight. He is a—"
"Bobby! Don't be foolish. How could I be in love

with him?"
"Well, you can't help it sometimes. Even princes fall

in love without knowing it."
"I suppose so," dreamily.
"It's mighty hard to make up your mind which one

you love best, though. Dr. Barrett's daughter in New

York is awful nice, but I think she's—"
"She is twenty years older than you, Bobby, if you

mean to say you are in love with her."
"Well, but I'll grow up, auntie. Anyhow, Paula

Vedrowski is not so old as I. She is—"
"For heaven's sake, Bobby, do go to sleep!"
"Don't you care to hear about my love affairs?"
"You are perfectly ridiculous!"
"All right for you, auntie. I shan't listen when you

want to tell me about yours. Gee, Uncle Jack listens,

you bet. I wish he was here this minute. Say, is he

ever going to get married?" There was no answer.

He peered over the top of the pillow. There were tears

in his Aunt Loraine's eyes. "Oh, say, auntie, darling,

don't cry! I'll—I'll go to sleep, honest!"
She was not in love with Truxton King, but she was

a fine, tender-hearted girl, who suffered because of the

thing that had happened to him and because she loved

his sister.
Over in the Hotel Regengetz, on a little table in the

centre of the room, lay a thick envelope with the royal

arms emblazoned in the upper corner. It contained an

invitation to the private circus that had been arranged

for the little Prince, and it bore the name of Truxton

King.
Across the foot of the bed hung his evening clothes,

laid out by a faithful and well-tipped house valet, snug

and ready for instant use.
But where was Truxton King?

CHAPTER X
THE IRON COUNT
When King, in the kindness of his heart, grasped the

old woman to keep her from falling to the floor, he

played directly into the hands of very material agencies

under her control. There was nothing ghostly or even

spiritual in the incidents that followed close upon the

simulated fainting spell of the fortune-teller. It has been

said before that her bony fingers closed upon his arms in

a far from feeble manner. He had no time for surprise

at this sudden recovery; there was only time to see a

fiendish grin flash into her face. The next instant something

struck him in the face; then with a fierce jerk this

same object tightened about his neck. His attempt to

yell out was checked before a sound could issue from his

lips.
It all came to him in a flash. A noose had been dropped

over his head; as he was pulled backward, his startled,

bulging eyes swept the ceiling. The mystery was explained,

but in a manner that left him small room for

satisfaction. Above him a square opening had appeared

in the ceiling; two ugly, bearded faces were leaning over

the edge and strong hands were grasping a thick rope.

In a frenzy of fear and desperation he cast the old

woman from him and tore violently at the rope.
They were drawing hard from above; his toes were

barely touching the floor; he was strangling. Frantically

he grasped the rope, lifting himself from the

floor in the effort to loosen the noose with his free hand.

A hoarse laugh broke upon his dinning ears, the leering

faces drew nearer; and then, as everything went black,

a heavy, yet merciful blow fell upon his head. As consciousness

left him, he felt himself rushing dizzily upward,

grasped by powerful hands and whisked through

the opening into air so hot and stiffling that his last

thought was of the fires of Hell.
Not many minutes passed before consciousness, which

had been but partially lost, returned to him. The ringing

sensation remained in his head, but he was no longer

choking. The noose had been removed from his neck;

the rope itself was now serving as a bond for his hands

and feet, a fact that impressed itself upon him when he

tried to rise. For some time he lay perfectly still,

urging his senses into play: wondering where he was and

what had happened to him.
It was pitch dark and the air was hot and close. Not

a sound came to his throbbing cars. With characteristic

irrepressibility he began to swear softly, but articulately.

Proof that his profanity was mild—one might

say genteel—came in an instant. A gruff voice, startlingly

near at hand, interrupted him.
"Spit it out, young feller! Swear like a man, not like

a damn canary bird."
Truxton tried hard to pierce the darkness, a strange

thrill passing through his veins. The hidden speaker

was unquestionably an American.
"What the devil does all this mean?" demanded the

captive. "Where am I?"
"It means business, and you're here, that's where you

are," was the sarcastic answer.
"Are you an American?"
"No. I'm a Chinaman."
"Oh, come off! Answer square."
"Well, I was born in Newport." As an afterthought:

"Kentucky."
"You're in a damned nice business, I'll say that for

you," growled Truxton. "Who is responsible for this

outrage?"
He heard the man yawn prodigiously. "Depends on

what you call an outrage."
"This is the damnedest high-handed outrage I've

ever—"
"Better save your breath, young feller. You won't

have it very long, so save what you can of it."
Truxton was silent for a moment, analysing this unique

remark. "You mean I am to stop breathing altogether?"
"Something like that."
"Why?"
"I don't know."
"You don't know? Well, who does?"
"You'll find out when the boss gets good and ready."
"You are a fine American!"
"Look here, young feller, I've been polite to you, so

don't get gay. I'll come over there and kick your jaw

in."
"Come ahead. Anything to break the monotony."
"Didn't you get enough of the hangman's knot and

the sandbag? Want more, eh? Well, if I wasn't so

darned comfortable I'd come over there and give it to

you. Now don't rile me!"
"I deserve to be kicked for being such a blithering fool

as to get into this mess. Come on and kick me."
"You wanted to get a poke at the old man's eye, did

ye? By thunder, that's like an American. Never satisfied

to let things alone. See what it got you into?"
"The old man's eye? What old man?"
"That's for you to find out, if you can. You've made

a hell of a poor start at it."
"You're a good-natured scoundrel"
"Thanks for them kind words."
"Well, what are you going to do with me? I don't

like the air in here. It's awful. How long do I stay

here?"
"Say, you're a gritty little man. I like your nerve.

Too bad we ain't on the same side. I'll tell you this:

you won't be here long. How would the old girl down

there put it? You're going on a long voyage. That's

it. But first we'll get out of this rat hole, just as soon

as them other guys come back from the cave. You'll

get fresh air purty soon. Now, don't talk any more.

I'm through gossipin'!"
"How do you, an American, happen to be mixed up in

a deal like this?"
"It's healthier work than makin' barrels at—I was goin'

to say Sing Sing, but I hear they've changed the name.

I prefer outdoor work."
"Fugitive, eh?"
"You might call it that. I'm wanted in seven States.

The demand for me is great."
Truxton saw that he could get nothing out of the

satirical rascal, so fell to speculating for himself. That

he was still in the loft above the hovel was more or less

clear to him. His mind, now active, ran back to the

final scene in the kitchen. The trap-door in the ceiling,

evidently a sliding arrangement, explained the mysterious

disappearance of the owner of the eye; he had been

whisked up through the aperture by confederates and

the trap-door closed before it could be discovered. The

smoking kettle no longer puzzled him, now that he

knew of the secret room above the kitchen; a skilfully

concealed blow-pipe could have produced the phenomenon.

The space in which he was now lying, half suffocated,

was doubtless a part of the cleverly designed

excavation at the back of the hovel, the lower half being

the kitchen, the upper an actual gateway to the open

air somewhere in the mountainside.
That he had fallen into the hands of a band of conspirators

was also quite clear to him. Whether they

were brigands or more important operators against the

Crown, he was, of course, in no position to decide. Time

would tell.
It was enough that they expected to kill him, sooner

or later. This, in itself, was sufficient to convince him

that he was not to be held for ransom, but to be disposed

of for reasons best known to his captors.
Like a shot the warning of Olga Platanova flashed into

his brain. Here, then, was the proof that she actually

knew of the peril he was in. But why should he be an

object of concern to these men, whoever they were? His

guard had mentioned "the old man." Good heavens,

could he mean Spantz? The cold perspiration was

standing on King's brow. Spantz! He recalled the

wickedness in the armourer's face. But why should

Spantz wish him evil? Again intuition, encouraged by

memory, supplied him with a possible, even plausible explanation.
The Anarchists! The Reds! Olga was an avowed

Anarchist; she was almost a prisoner in the house of her

uncle. Truxton's guard sat up suddenly and felt for

his weapon when the captive let out a bitter oath of

understanding and rage.
"By gad, they think I am a detective!" he added, light

coming to him with a rush.
"What's that?" snapped the other. Truxton could

almost feel the other's body grow tense despite the space

between them. "Are you a detective? Are you? By

God, if you are, I'll finish you up right here.

You—"
"No! They're on the wrong scent. By Jove, the

laugh's on old man Spantz."
"Oho! So you do know what's up, then? Spantz, eh?

Well, what you've guessed at or found out won't make

much difference, my fine young fellow. They've got

you, and you'll be worse off than Danny Deever in the

mornin'! Hello! Here they come. Now we'll get out

of this infernal bake-oven. Say, do you know, you've

been cuddlin' up against a j'int of warm stove pipe for

nearly an hour? Sh!"
The glimmer of a light came bobbing up from somewhere

behind Truxton; he could see the flickering

shadows on the wall. Two men crept into the room a

moment later. One of them carried a lantern; the other

turned King's body over with his foot.
"You damned brute," grated the captive.
"Call him what you like, young feller," said his first

acquaintance. "He can't understand a word you say.

Well, do we pull out?" This to the man with the lantern.
The roof was so low that they were compelled to stoop

in moving about. Truxton saw that the three ruffians

were great, brutal-faced fellows, with bared arms that

denoted toil as well as spoils.
"Immediate!" said the lantern bearer. "Come; we drag

him to the cave."
"Drag? Nix; we c'n carry him, pard. I'm not for

draggin' him down that passage. Grab hold there,—you!

Hey, get his feet, damn you!" The third man

was reluctant to understand, but at last grasped the

prisoner by the feet, swearing in a language of his own.

The Yankee desperado took his shoulders, and together,

with earnest grunts, they followed the man with the

lantern, Truxton knew not whither except that it was

away from the wretched sweat-hole.
He could see that they were crowding through a low,

narrow passage, the earthen sides of which reeked with

moisture. Twice they paused to rest, resuming the

journey after a season of cursing, finally depositing

him with scant courtesy upon the rocky floor of what

proved to be a rather commodious cave. The breath was

almost jarred from his body. He had the satisfaction

of driving his two heels viciously against the person of

the man who had held them the last ten minutes, receiving

a savage kick in return.
Daylight streamed into this convenient "hole in the

wall;" lying upon his side, Truxton faced the opening

that looked out upon the world. He saw nothing but

blue sky. Near the opening, looking down as if into

the valley below, stood the tall, gaunt figure of a man,

thin-shouldered and stooped. His back was to the captive,

but King observed that the three men, with two

companions, who sat at the back of the cave, never removed

their gaze from the striking figure outlined

against the sky.
Many minutes passed before the watcher turned

slowly to take in the altered conditions behind him.

King saw that he was old; grey-haired and cadaverous,

with sharp, hawk-like features. This, then, was the "old

man," and he was not William Spantz. Unlike Spantz

in every particular was this man who eyed him so darkly,

so coldly. Here was a highborn man, a man whose very

manners bespoke for him years at court, a life spent in

the upper world, not among the common people. Truxton

found himself returning the stare with an interest

that brought results.
"Your name is King, I believe," came from the thin

lips of the old man. The tones were as metallic as the

click of steel.
"Yes. May I inquire—"
"No, you may not inquire. Put a gag in his mouth.

I don't care to hear anything from him. Gag him and

cut the rope from his feet. He may walk from now on."
Three men sprang to do his bidding.
King felt in that instant that he was looking for the

first time upon the features of the Iron Count, Marlanx

the dishonoured. He lay there helpless, speechless for

many minutes, glancing at this cruel tyrant. Into his

soul sank the conviction that no mercy would come from

this man, this hater of all men; justice would play no

part in the final, sickening tragedy. It was enough that

Marlanx suspected him of being in the way; to be suspected

was to be condemned. The whole, hellish conspiracy

flashed through his brain. He closed his eyes

with the horror of it all.
Here was Marlanx on Graustark soil, conniving with

cutthroats, commanding them without opposition. What

could it mean except a swift-growing menace to the

Crown—to the little Prince.
Marlanx was speaking. Truxton looked up, as at an

executioner. The lean, cruel face of that beautiful girl's

husband was not far from his own; the fiery eyes were

burning into his. The Iron Count sat upon a boulder

near his feet.
"So you are the Quixote who would tilt at invisible

windmills, eh? I remember you quite well. We have

met before. Perhaps you remember meeting my eye in

Dame Babba's cabin—twice, I think. You remember,

I see. Ha, ha! You were very slow not to have caught

such an old man. You were near to it the first time,

but—you missed it, eh? I thought you might have seen

my heels as I disappeared. I dare say you are wondering

what I intend to do with you, now that I have you.

Well, I am not the man to mince words. Mr. King, you

are quite young, but the good die young. I am very old,

you observe. I will not say that you are to die to-night

or to-morrow or any day, for I do not know. I am going

to send you to a court. Not an ordinary court, Mr.

King, but one of extreme perspicacity. I fancy you will

die before long. We can spare you. I do not approve

of meddlers. It seems to be quite settled that you are a

police agent. Be that as it may, I imagine our little

court of last resort will take no chances, one way or the

other. A man or two, more or less, will not be counted

a year from now."
The steady, cruel eyes fascinated King. He knew that

he was in desperate straits, that he had one chance in a

million to escape, and yet he found himself held by the

spell of those eyes, drinking in certain metallic monotones

as if hypnotised.
"I am glad you called again at my temporary abode,

Mr. King. Americans are always welcome: the sooner

they come, the sooner it's over. It may interest you to

know that I am very partial to Americans. Were I a

cannibal, I could eat them with relish. If I had my way,

all Americans should be in heaven. The earth surely is

not good enough nor big enough for them, and hell is

already overcrowded. Yes," reflectively pressing his

nose with a bony forefinger, "I love the Americans dearly.

I should enjoy a similar visit from Mr. John Tullis. Although,

I may say, he seems to be choosing another way

of testing my hospitality. I expect him to visit me in

my humble castle before many days. I should like to

have him remain there until his dying day." There was

a deep significance in his smile. King shuddered. His

gaze followed the gaunt, spidery old man as he returned

to the opening for another long survey of the valley

below. Night was falling; the sky was growing darker,

and the wind was rising. Marlanx's sharp features were

not so distinguishable when he returned to the boulder.

The men in the cave had not spoken except in whispers.

They appeared to be living in abject fear of this grim

old nobleman.
"Night is coming. I must say farewell, my bold young

friend. My way lies to the north. This is merely a land

of promise to me. You go southward, to the city of

Edelweiss. But not through the gates; oh, no! There

are other ways, as you will find. If you should, by any

chance, escape the jurisdiction of the court I am sending

you to, I sincerely trust you may honour me with another

visit here. I come often to the hovel in the glen.

It is the only friendly house I know of in all Graustark.

Some day I may be able to recompense its beauteous

mistress. My good friends, Dangloss, and Halfont, and

Braze—and Tullis, whom I know only by reputation—are,

as yet, unaware of my glorious return to Graustark,

else they would honour me with their distinguished presence.

Some day I may invite them to dine with me. I

shall enjoy seeing them eat of the humble pie I can put

before them. Good-bye, my brave Sir Galahad; I may

never see you again."
With a courtly bow he turned from the tense-muscled

captive and directed his final instructions to the men.

"Take him at once to the city, but be on your guard. A

single false move now means utter ruin for all of us. Our

affairs go so well at present that we cannot afford to

offend Dame Fortune. She smiles on us, my men. Take

this fool to the house on the Monastery road. There you

will turn him over to the others. It is for them to drag

the truth from his lips. I'd suggest, dear Mr. King,

that you tell them all you know before they begin the

dragging process. It is a very unpleasant way they

have." With a curt nod to the men, he strode out

through the mouth of the cave and was gone. Dusk had

settled down upon mountain and valley; a thin fog swam

high in the air above. One of the men cut the rope that

bound Truxton's feet.
"Get up," said the Newport man. "We've got to be

movin'. How'd you like the old man? Smart bug,

ain't he? Say, he'll throw the hooks into them guys

down in Edelweiss so hard one of these days that they

won't come out till they rot out."
Still gagged and somewhat dizzy, King was hurried off

into the narrow mountain path, closely surrounded by

the five men.
"They tell me your friend, the Cook guy, got plugged

down in the Gap when he tried to duck this afternoon,"

volunteered the Yankee unconcernedly.
Hobbs shot? King's eyes suddenly filled with tears, a

great wave of pity and shame rushing to his heart.

Poor Hobbs! He had led him into this; to gratify a vain-glorious

whim, he had done the little Englishman to death.
The silent, cautious march down the valley, through the

Gap and along the ridge carried them far into the night.

King knew that they were skirting the main roads,

keeping to the almost hidden trails of the mountaineers.

They carried no light, nor did they speak to each other,

except in hoarse whispers. In single file they made their

way, the prisoner between them, weary, footsore and

now desperate in the full realisation of his position.

Being gagged, he could make no appeal to the one man

who might befriend him—his villainous countryman. It

occurred to him—grim thought—that the astute

Marlanx had considered that very probability, and had

made it impossible for him to resort to the cupidity of

the hireling.
At last, when he could scarcely drag his feet after him,

they came to a halt. A consultation followed, but he

could not understand a word. This much he knew: they

were in the hills directly above the northern gates. Two

of the men went forward, moving with extreme caution.

In half an hour they returned and the march was resumed.
Their next halt came sooner than he expected. The

vague, black shadow of a lightless house loomed up before

them. In a twinkling he was hustled across the

road and into a door. Then down a flight of stairs,

through pitchy darkness, guided by two of the men, a

whispered word of advice now and then from the Yankee

saving him from perilous stumbles. He was jerked up

sharply with a command to stand still. A light flashed

suddenly in his face, blinding him for the moment.

Voices in eager, quick conversation came to his ears long

before his eyes could take in the situation.
Soon he saw that they were in a broad, bare cellar;

three men in heavy black beards were in earnest conversation

with several of his captors; all were gesticulating

fiercely.
His Newport companion enlightened him, between puffs

of the pipe he was struggling with. "Here's where we

say good-bye, young fellow. We turn you over to these

gents, whoever they are. I'm sort of out of it when

they get to jabberin' among themselves. I can understand

'em when they talk slow, but, say, did you ever

hear a flock of Union Square sparrows chirp faster than

them fellers is talkin' now? Nix. You go into the

village gay with these Schwabs by the sewer line, I

guess." Truxton pricked up his ears. "The old man

has had a hole chopped in the sewer here, they tell me,

and it's a snap to get into the city. Not very clean or

neat, but it gets you there. Well, so long! They're

ready, I see. They don't monkey long when they've got

a thing to do. I'd advise you not to be too stubborn

when they get you to headquarters; it may go easier with

you. I'm not so damned bad, young feller. It's just

the business I'm in—and the company."
King felt a thrill of real regard for the rascal. He

nodded his thanks and tried to smile. The fellow

grinned and slapped him on the shoulder, unobserved by

the others. In another moment his guardianship was

transferred; he was being hurried across the cellar

toward an open doorway. Down a few stone steps he

was led by the bearded crew, and then pushed through

a hole in what appeared to be a heavy brick wall. He

realised at once where he was. The gurgle of running

water, the odor of foul airs came up to him. It was the

great sewer that ran from the hills through the heart

of the city, flushed continuously by a diverted mountain

stream that swept down from above.
He was wading in cold water over a slippery bottom,

tightly held by two men, the third going ahead with the

lantern. Always ahead loomed the black, opaque circle

which never came nearer, never grew smaller. It was the

ever receding wall of darkness.
He did not know how long they traversed the chill

sewer in this fashion. In time, however, the water got

deeper; rats began to scurry along the sides of the

circle or to swim frantically on in front of the disturbers.

The smells were sickening, overpowering. Only excitement,

curiosity, youth—whatever you may care to

term it-kept him up and going. The everlasting glory

of youth never ends until old age has provided the surfeit

of knowledge; the strife to see ahead, to find out what is

to be, to know,—that is youth. Youth dies when curiosity

ends. The emotion is even stronger than the dread

of what may lie beyond in the pallid sea of uncertainty.
His bones were chilled and creaking with fatigue. He

was remorselessly hungry. There was water, but he

could not drink it.
At last the strange journey ended. They came to a

niche in the slimy wall. Up into this the men climbed,

dragging him after them. The man above was cautiously

tapping on what appeared to be solid masonry.

To King's surprise a section of the wall suddenly

opened before them. He was seized from above by

strong hands and literally jerked through the hole, his

companions following. Up narrow steps, through a

sour-smelling passage and—then, into a long, dimly

lighted room, in the centre of which stood a long table.
He was not permitted to linger here for long, but

passed on into a small room adjoining. Some one,

speaking in English, told him to sit down. The gag was

removed from his stiff, inflamed mouth.
"Fetch him some water," said a voice that he was sure

he recognised—a high, querulous voice.
"Hello, Spantz," articulated Truxton, turning to the

black-bearded, bent figure.
There was an instance of silence. Then Spantz spoke,

with a soft laugh: "You will not know so much to-morrow,

Herr King. Give him the water, man. He

has much to say to us, and he cannot talk with a dry

throat."
"Nor an empty stomach," added King. He drank long

of the pitcher that was held to his lips.
"This is not the Regengetz," growled a surly voice.
"You mean, I don't eat?"
"Not at midnight, my friend."
"It seems to be an all-night joint."
"Enough," cried Spantz. "Bring him out here. The

others have come."
King was pushed out into the larger room, where he

was confronted by a crowd of bewhiskered men and

snaky-eyed women with most intellectual nose-glasses.

It required but a glance to convince him that the

whiskers were false.
For nearly an hour he was probed with questions concerning

his business in Edelweiss. Threats followed

close upon his unsatisfactory answers, though they were

absolutely truthful. There was no attempt made to disguise

the fact that they were conspiring against the

government; in fact, they were rather more open than

secretive. When he thought of it afterward, a chill

crept over him. They would not have spoken so openly

before him if they entertained the slightest fear that he

would ever be in a position to expose them.
"We'll find a way to make you talk to-morrow, my

friend. Starving is not pleasant."
"You would not starve me!" he cried.
"No. You will have the pleasure of starving yourself,"

said a thin-eyed fellow whom he afterward knew as Peter

Brutus.
He was thrown back into the little room. To his surprise

and gratification, the bonds on his wrists were removed.

Afterward he was to know that there was

method in this action of his gaolers: his own utter impotency

was to be made more galling to him by the maddening

knowledge that he possessed hands and feet and

lungs—and could not use them!
He found a match in his box and struck it. There was

no article of furniture. The floor was bare, the walls

green with age. He had a feeling that there would be

rats; perhaps lizards. A search revealed the fact that

his purse, his watch and his pocket-knife were missing.

Another precious match showed him that there were no

windows. A chimney hole in the ceiling was, perhaps,

the only means by which fresh air could reach this dreary

place.
"Well, I guess I'm here to stay," he said to himself.

He sat down with his back to the wall, despair in his

soul. A pitiful, weak smile came to him in the darkness,

as he thought of the result of his endeavour to "show

off" for the benefit of the heartless girl in rajah silk.

"What an ass I am," he groaned. "Now she will never

know."
Sleep was claiming his senses. He made a pillow of his

coat, commended himself to the charity of rats and

other horrors, and stretched his weary bones upon the

relentless floor.
"No one will ever know," he murmured, his last waking

thought being of a dear one at home.

CHAPTER XI
UNDER THE GROUND
Day and night were the same to the occupant of the

little room. They passed with equal slowness and impartial

darkness. Five days that he could account for

crawled by before anything unusual happened to break

the strain of his solitary, inexplicable confinement. He

could tell when it was morning by the visit of a bewhiskered

chambermaid with a deep bass voice, who carried

a lighted candle and kicked him into wakefulness.

The second day after his incarceration began, he was

given food and drink. It was high time, for he was

almost famished. Thereafter, twice a day, he was led

into the larger room and given a surprisingly hearty

meal. Moreover, he was allowed to bathe his face and

hands and indulge in half an hour's futile stretching

of limbs. After the second day few questions were

asked by the men who had originally set themselves up

as inquisitors. At first they had treated him with a

harshness that promised something worse, but an incident

occurred on the evening of the second day that

changed the whole course of their intentions.
Peter Brutus had just voiced the pleasure of the

majority by urging the necessity for physical torture to

wring the government's secrets from the prisoner. King,

half famished, half crazed by thirst, had been listening

to the fierce argument through the thin door that separated

the rooms. He heard the sudden, eager movement

toward the door of his cell, and squared himself against

the opposite wall, ready to fight to the death. Then

there came a voice that he recognised.
A woman was addressing the rabid conspirators in tones

of deadly earnestness. His heart gave a bound. It was

the first time since his incarceration that he had heard

the voice of Olga Platanova, she who had warned him,

she who still must be his friend. Once more he threw

himself to the floor and glued his ear to the crack; her

voice had not the strident qualities of the other women

in this lovely company.
"You are not to do this thing," she was saying. King

knew that she stood between her companions and the

door. "You are not to touch him! Do you hear me,

Peter Brutus? All of you?"
There followed the silence of stupefaction, broken at

last by a voice which he recognised as that of old man

Spantz.
"Olga! Stand aside!"
"No! You shall not torture him. I have said he is no

spy. I still say it. He knows nothing of the police and

their plans. He has not been spying upon us. I am

sure of it."
"How can you be sure of it?" cried a woman's voice,

harsh and strident.
"He has played with you," sneered another.
"I will not discuss the point. I know he is not what

you say he is. You have no right to torture him. You

have no right to hold him prisoner."
"God, girl, we cannot turn him loose now. He must

never go free again. He must die." This was from

Spantz.
"We cannot release him, I grant you," she said, and

Truxton's heart sank. "Not now, but afterward, yes.

When it is all over he can do no harm. But, hear me

now, all of you. If he is harmed in any way, if he is

maltreated, or if you pursue this design to starve him,

I shall not perform my part of the work on the 26th.

This is final."
For a full minute, it seemed to King, no one spoke.
"You cannot withdraw," exclaimed Peter Brutus. "You

are pledged. You are sworn. It is ordained."
"Try me, and see if I will not do as I say. He is to

be treated kindly so long as we hold him here and he is

to be released when the committee is in power. Then

he may tell all that he knows, for it will be of no avail.

He cannot escape, that you know. If he were a spy I

would offer no objection to your methods. He is an

American gentleman, a traveller. I, Olga Platanova,

say this to you. It is not a plea, not a petition; it is

an ultimatum. Spare him, or the glorious cause must

suffer by my defection."
"Sh! Not so loud, girl! He can hear every word you

say!"
"Why should it matter, madam? He is where he can

do no harm to our cause. Let him hear. Let him understand

what it is that we are doing. Are we ashamed of

our duty to the world? If so, then we are criminals, not

deliverers. I am not ashamed of what God wills me to

do. It is horrible, but it is the edict of God. I will

obey. But God does not command us to torture an innocent

man who happens to fall into our hands. No!

Let him hear. Let him know that I, Olga Platanova,

am to hurl the thing that is to destroy the life of Prince

Robin. I am not afraid to have him know to-day what

the world will know next week. Let him hear and revile

me now, as the world will do after it is over and I am

gone. The glory will be mine when all the people of this

great globe are joined to our glorious realm. Then the

world will say that Olga Platanova was not a beast, but

a deliverer, a creator! Let him hear!"
The listener's blood was running cold. The life of

Prince Robin! An assassination! "The thing that will

destroy!" A bomb! God!
For half an hour they argued with her, seeking to turn

her from the stand she had taken; protesting to the last

stage, cursing her for a sentimental fool. Then they

came to terms with her. Truxton King owed his life to

this strange girl who knew him not at all, but who believed

in him. He suffered intensely in the discovery

that she was, in the end, to lend herself to the commission

of the most heartless and diabolical of crimes—the

destruction of that innocent, well-worshipped boy of

Graustark.
"You must be in love with this simple-minded American,

who comes—" Peter Brutus started to say at one

stage of the discussion, when the frail girl was battling

almost physically with her tormentors.
"Stop! Peter Brutus, you shall not say that! You

know where my love lies! Don't say that to me again,

you beast!" she had cried, and Brutus was silenced.
Truxton was brought into the room a few minutes later.

He was white with emotion as he faced the Committee of

Ten. Before a word could be addressed to him he

blurted out:
"You damned cowards! Weak as I am, I would have

fought for you, Miss Platanova, if I could have got

through that door. Thank you for what you have done

to convince these dogs! I would to God I could save

you from this thing you are pledged to do. It is frightful!

I cannot think it of you! Give it up! All of

you, give this thing up! I will promise secrecy—I will

never betray what I have heard. Only don't do this awful

thing! Think of that dear little boy—"
Olga Platanova cried out and covered her eyes with

her hands, murmuring the words "dear little boy" over

and over again. She was led from the room by William

Spantz. Peter Brutus stood over King, whose arms

were held by two stalwart men.
"Enough!" he commanded. "We spare you, not for

her sake, but for the sake of the cause we serve. Hear

me: you are to be held here a prisoner until our plans are

consummated. You will be properly fed and cared for.

You have heard Miss Platanova say that she will cook

the food for you herself, but you are not to see her. Do

not seek to turn her from her purpose. That you cannot

do. She is pledged to it; it is irrevocable. We have

perhaps made a mistake in bringing you here: it would

have been far wiser to kill you in the beginning,

but—"
King interrupted him. "I haven't the least doubt that

you will kill me in the end. She may not be here to

protect me after—after the assassination."
"She is prepared to die by the same bomb that slays

the Prince," was all that Brutus would say in response

to this, but King observed the sly look that went round

amongst them. He knew then that they meant to kill

him in the end.
Afterward, in his little room, he writhed in the agony

of helplessness. The Prince, his court, the government—all

were to be blasted to satisfy the end of this sickening

conspiracy. Loraine! She, too, was doomed! He

groaned aloud in his misery and awe.
Food and water came after that, but he ate and drank

little, so depressed had he become. He sought for every

means of escape that suggested itself to him. The walls,

the floors, the doors, the stairway to the armourer's

shop—all were impassable, so carefully was he guarded.

From time to time he heard inklings of the plot which

was to culminate on the fatal 26th; he did not get the

details in particular, but he knew that the bomb was to

be hurled at the Prince near the entrance to the plaza

and that Marlanx's men were to sweep over the stricken

city almost before the echo died away.
There was a telegraph instrument in the outer room.

He could hear it ticking off its messages day and night,

and could hear the discussion of reports as they came

in or went out. It soon became clear to him that the

wire connected the room with Marlanx's headquarters

near Balak in Axphain, a branch instrument being stationed

in the cave above the Witch's hut. He marvelled

at the completeness of the great conspiracy; and

marvelled more because it seemed to be absolutely unknown

to the omnipresent Dangloss.
On his third night he heard the Committee discussing

the failure of one of Marlanx's most cunning schemes.

The news had come in over the wire and it created no

small amount of chagrin among the Red conspirators.

That one detail in their mighty plot should go contrary

to expectations seemed to disturb them immeasurably.

King was just beginning to realise the stupendous possibilities

of the plot; he listened for every detail with a

mind so fascinated by horror that it seemed hardly able

to grasp the seriousness of his own position.
It seemed that Marlanx deemed it necessary—even imperative—to

the welfare of the movement, that John

Tullis should be disposed of summarily before the crucial

chapter in their operations. Truxton heard the

Committee discussing the fiasco that attended his first attempt

to draw the brainy, influential American out of

the arena. It was clear that Marlanx suspected Tullis

of a deep admiration for his wife, the Countess Ingomede;

he was prepared to play upon that admiration

for the success of his efforts. The Countess disappeared

on a recent night, leaving the court in extreme doubt as

to her fate. Later a decoy telegram was sent by a

Marlanx agent, informing Tullis that she had gone to

Schloss Marlanx, never to return, but so shrewdly

worded that he would believe that it had been sent by

coercion, and that she was actually a prisoner in the

hands of her own husband. Tullis was expected to follow

her to the Castle, bent on rescue. As a matter of

fact, the Countess was a prisoner in the hills near Balak,

spirited away from her own garden by audacious agents

of the Iron Count. Tullis was swift to fall into the

trap, but, to the confusion of the arch-plotter, he was

just as swift to avoid the consequences.
He left Edelweiss with two secret service men, bound

for Schloss Marlanx. All unknown to him, a selected

company of cutthroats were in waiting for him on the

hills near the castle. To the amazement of the conspirators,

he suddenly retraced his tracks and came back to

Edelweiss inside of twenty-four hours, a telegram stopping

him at Gushna, a hundred miles down the line. The

message was from Dangloss and it was in cipher. A

trainman in the service of Marlanx could only say, in

explanation, that the American had smiled as he deciphered

the dispatch and at once left the carriage with

his men to await the up-train at six o'clock.
Peter Brutus repeated a message he had just received

from Marlanx at Balak. It was to the effect that he had

reason to believe that his wife had managed, through

an unknown traitor, to send word to the Tower that she

was not at Schloss Marlanx, nor in any immediate

danger. He felt himself supported in this belief by the

obvious fact that no further efforts had been made by

Tullis or the police since that day. The authorities apparently

were inactive and Tullis was serenely secure

at the Royal Castle. The guard about the Prince, however,

had been largely increased.
Tullis was known to be re-organising the Royal Guard,

supported by the ministry to a man, it was said; not

even the Duke of Perse opposed him.
"The Count is more afraid of this man Tullis than of

all the rest," averred Peter Brutus. "He has reasons

to hate and fear the Americans. That is why he desires

the death of our prisoner. He has said, time and again,

over the wire that King will in some way escape and play

the deuce with our plans. It does not seem possible,

however. We have him absolutely secure, and Olga—well,

you know how she feels about it."
"I don't see why he should be so disturbed by Tullis,"

growled one of the men. "He has no real authority at

court and he is but one man against an unseen army that

will not strike until everything is ready. There can be

no—"
"That is what I have said to my master, Julius, but

he will not be convinced. He says that he has had experience

with one American, Lorry, and he knows the

breed. Tullis has more power at court than the people

think. He is shrewd and strong and not to be caught

napping. As a matter of fact, the Count says, Tullis

has already scented danger in the air and has induced

the ministry to prepare for an uprising. Of course, he

cannot know of the dynamiting that is to open the way

to success, but it is true that if anybody can upset our

plans, it is this meddling American. He is a self-appointed

guardian of the Prince and he is not to be

sneered at. The regents are puppets, nothing more."
Julius Spantz agreed with Brutus. "I know that the

guard is being strengthened and that certain precautions

are being taken to prevent the abduction of the

Prince. It is common rumour among the soldiers that

Count Marlanx will some day seek to overthrow the

government and take the throne. The air is full of

talk concerning this far-distant possibility. Thank God,

it is to be sooner than they think. If Tullis and General

Braze were given a month or two longer, I doubt if we

could succeed. The blow must catch them unprepared."
"This is the 22d, Saturday is the 26th. They can

do nothing in four days," said one of the women.
"Count Marlanx will be ready on the 26th. He has

said so. A new strike will be declared on the railroad

on the 25th and the strikers will be in the city with their

grievances. Saturday's celebration will bring men from

the mountains and the mines to town. A single blow,

and we have won." So spoke Brutus.
"Then why all this fear of Tullis?" demanded Anna

Cromer.
"It is not like the Iron Count," added Madame Drovnask

with a sneer.
Olga Platanova had not spoken. She was not there to

talk. She was only to act on the 26th of July. She

was the means to an end.
"Well, fear or no fear, the Count lies awake trying

to think of a way to entice him from the city before the

26th. It may be silly, madam, but Count Marlanx is

a wiser man than any of us here. He is not afraid of

Dangloss or Braze or Quinnox, but he is afraid of what

he calls 'American luck!' He is even superstitious

about it."
"We must not—we cannot fail," grated William

Spantz, and the cry was reiterated by half a dozen

voices.
"The world demands success of us!" cried Anna

Cromer. "We die for success, we die for failure! It is

all one!"
The next morning, after a sleepless night, Truxton

King made his first determined attempt to escape. All

night long he had lain there thinking of the horrid

thing that was to happen on the black 26th. He counted

the days, the hours, the minutes. Morning brought the

23d. Only three days more! Oh, if he could but get

one word to John Tullis, the man Marlanx feared; if

he could only break away from these fiends long enough

to utter one cry of warning to the world, even with his

dying gasp!
Marlanx feared the Americans! He even feared him,

a helpless captive! The thrill of exultation that ran

through his veins was but the genesis of an impulse that

mastered him later on.
He knew that two armed men stood guard in the outer

room day and night. The door to the stairway leading

into the armourer's shop was of iron and heavily barred;

the door opening into the sewer was even more securely

bolted; besides, there was a great stone door at the foot

of the passage. The keys to these two doors were never

out of the possession of William Spantz; one of his

guards held the key to the stairway door. His only

chance lay in his ability to suddenly overpower two men

and make off by way of the armourer's shop.
When his little door was opened on the morning of the

23d, Truxton King's long, powerful figure shot

through as if sped by a catapult. The man with the

candle and the knife went down like a beef, floored by a

blow on the jaw.
The American, his eyes blazing with hope and

desperation, kept onward—to find himself face to face

with Olga Platanova!
She was staring at him with frightened eyes, her lips

apart, her hands to her breast. The tableau was brief.

He could not strike her down. With a curse he was

turning to the man on the floor, eager to snatch the

keys from his belt. A scream from her drawn lips held

him; he whirled and looked into the now haggard face

of the girl he had considered beautiful. The penalty

for her crime was already written there. She was to die

in three days!
"He has not the key!" she cried. "Nor have I. You

have no chance to escape. Go back! Go back! They

are coming!"
A key rattled in the door. When it swung open, two

men stood in the aperture, both with drawn pistols. The

girl leaped between them and the helpless, defeated

American.
"Remember!" she cried. "You are not to kill him!"
Peter Brutus had risen from the floor, half dazed but

furious. He made a vicious leap at King, his knife ready

for the lunge.
"I'm glad it's you," roared King, leaping aside. His

fist shot out and again Brutus went down. The men in

the doorway actually laughed.
"A good blow, even if it avails you nothing," said one

of them drily. "He is not an especial favorite with us.

Return to your room at once. Miss Platanova, call your

uncle. It is now necessary to bind the fellow's hands.

They are too dangerous to be allowed to roam at large

in this fashion."
All day long Truxton paced his little prison, bitterly

lamenting his ill-timed effort. Now he would be even

more carefully guarded. His hands were bound behind

his back; he was powerless. If he had only waited!

Luck had been against him. How was he to know that

the guard with the keys had gone upstairs when Olga

brought his breakfast down? It was fate.
The 23d dragged itself into the past and the 24th

was following in the gloomy wake of its predecessors.

Two days more! He began to feel the approach of

madness! His own death was not far away. It would

follow that of the Prince and of Olga Platanova, his

friend. But he was not thinking of his own death; he

was thinking of the Prince's life!
The atmosphere of suppressed excitement that characterised

the hushed gatherings in the outer room did not

fail to leave its impression upon him; he knew there was

murder in the hearts of these fanatics; he could feel the

strain that held their hitherto vehement lips to tense

whisperings and mutterings. He could distinguish the

difference between the footsteps of to-day and those of

yesterday; the tread was growing lighter, unconsciously

more stealthy with each passing hour.
Forty-eight hours! That was all!
Truxton found himself crying bitterly from time to

time; not because he was in terror but because he knew

of the thing that hourly drew nearer despite the fact

that he knew!
Olga Platanova's voice was heard no more before the

Committee of Ten. Something told him that she was

being groomed and primed in an upstairs room! Primed

like a gun of war! He wondered if she could be praying

for courage to do the thing that had been set down for

her to do. Food now came irregularly to him. She was

no longer preparing it.
She was making herself ready!
Early that night, as he lay with his ear to the crack of

the door, he heard them discussing his own death. It

was to come as soon as Olga had gone to her reward!

She was not there to defend him. Spantz had said that

she was praying in her room, committing her soul to

God! Truxton King suddenly pricked up his ears, attracted

by a sentence that fell from the lips of one of the

men.
"Tullis is on his way to the hills of Dawsbergen by

this time. He will be out of the way on the 26th safe

enough."
"Count Marlanx was not to be satisfied until he had

found the means to draw him away from Edelweiss,"

said another. "This time it will work like a charm. Late

this afternoon Tullis was making ready to lead a troop

of cavalry into the hills to effect a rescue. Sancta

Maria! That was a clever stroke! Not only does he

go himself, but with him goes a captain with one hundred

soldiers from the fort. Ha, ha! Marlanx is a

fox! A very exceptional fox!"
Tullis off to the hills? With soldiers, to effect a

rescue! Truxton sat up, his brain whirling.
"A wise fox!" agreed Peter Brutus, thickly. His lips

were terribly swollen from King's final blow. "Tullis

goes off chasing a jack-o'-lantern in the hills; Marlanx

sits by and laughs at the joke he's played. It is good!

Almost too good to be true. I wonder what our fine

prisoner will say to it when the new prisoner comes to

keep him company over the 26th."

CHAPTER XII
A NEW PRISONER ARRIVES
It was far past midnight when King was roused from

the doze into which he had fallen, exhausted and disconsolate,

an hour earlier. Sounds of unusual commotion

reached him from the outer room. Instantly he was

wide awake, breathing heavily in the sudden overpowering

fear that he had slept for many hours and that the

time had come for the conspirators to go forth. Was

it the 26th?
Loud, quick commands came to his ears; the moving

of eager footsteps; the drawing of bolts.
"They are here at last," he heard some one say. "God,

this suspense has been horrible. But they are here."
"Stand ready, then, with the guns!" cried Peter

Brutus. "It may be a trick, after all. Don't open that

door down there, Spantz, until you know who is on the

outside."
Then followed a long interval of dead silence.
"It's all right," came at last in the relieved, eager

voice of Peter Brutus. "Clear the way, comrades. Give

them room! By our Holy Father, this is a brave triumph.

Ah!"
Heavy footsteps clogged into the room, accompanied

by stertorous breathing and no small amount of grunting

from masculine throats. Doors were closed, bolts

shot, and then many voices let loose their flow of eager

exclamations. Not one, but three or four languages

were spoken by the excited, intense occupants of the

outer room; King could, make nothing of what they

said. Finally the sharp, incisive voice of William

Spantz broke through the babble, commanding silence.
"Still unconscious," he said, when some measure of

order was secured.
"Yes," grunted one of the men, evidently a newcomer.

"Since we left the house above the ramparts. No need

for gags or bonds, but we used them, just the same.

Now that we are here, what is to be done?"
"We will have our instructions to-morrow. The Count

is to inform us before nightfall where she is to be removed

to. Next week she is to go to Schloss Marlanx."

Brutus inserted a cruel, heartless laugh, and then added:

"There she is to remain until he is quite ready to take her

to new apartments—in town. Trust the master to dispose

of her properly. He knows how to handle women

by this time."
A woman, thought Truxton. The Countess! They

had brought her here from Balak, after all. What a

remorseless brute Marlanx must be to maltreat his beautiful

wife as—Truxton did not complete the angry reflection.

Words from the other side of the door checked

the train of thought.
"To my mind, she is more beautiful than his own wife,"

observed Anna Cromer. "She will be a fine morsel for

the Count, who has even cast longing eyes on so homely

a mortal as I."
"All women are alike to him," said Spantz sententiously.

"I hope she is not to be left here for long. I

don't like women about at a time like this. No offence,

Madame Drovnask."
"She'll go to-morrow night, I'm sure," said Peter. "I

told the Count we could not keep her here over the—over

the 26th. You see, there is a bare possibility that

none of us may ever come back after the bomb is hurled.

See? We don't want a woman to die of starvation down

here, in that event. I don't care what happens to the

man in there. But the Count does not want this one to

starve. Oh, no; not he."
"We must put her in the room with the American for

the present. You are sure he will take her away before

Saturday? A woman's cries are most distressing." It

was Spantz who spoke.
"I'll stop her crying," volunteered Anna Cromer

harshly.
"I fancy you could, my dear," agreed Spantz. They

all laughed.
"She's regaining her senses," exclaimed one of the

men. "Stand back, every one. Give her air."
"Air?" cried Anna Cromer. "It's at a premium down

here, Raoul."
Presently the door to King's room was thrown open.

He had got to his feet and was standing in the centre of

the room, his eyes blinking in the glare of light.
"Holloh!" cried Peter Brutus, "you up, eh? We've

got a fair lady for you, my friend. Get back there,

you dog! Keep in your corner."
Truxton faced the ugly crowd beyond the door for a

moment and then fell back to the corner to watch the

proceedings with wondering, pitying eyes.
"You are a fine bunch of human beings," he blurted

out, savage with despair and rage. No one gave heed

to the compliment.
A man with a lighted candle entered first, holding the

light above his head. He was followed by two others,

who supported the drooping, tottering figure of a

woman.
"Let her sit there against the wall, Drago. Julius,

fetch in more candles. She must not be left in the dark.

He says she is not to be frightened to death. Women

are afraid of the dark—and strange dogs. Let there

be light," scoffed Peter Brutus, spitting toward King.
"I'll get you for that some day," grated the American,

white with anger. Peter hesitated, then spat again and

laughed loudly.
"Enough!" commanded William Spantz. "We are

not children." Turning to King he went on, a touch of

kindness in his voice: "Cheer her if you can. She is

one of your class. Do not let the lights go out."
Raising his hands, he fairly drove the others from the

doorway. An instant later, King and his miserable,

half-conscious companion were alone, locked in together,

the fitful light from the candle on the floor playing hide

and seek in shadows he had not seen before during his

age of imprisonment.
For a long time he stood in his corner, watching the

figure huddled against the opposite wall. Her face was

not plainly visible, her head having dropped forward

until the chin nestled in the lace jabot at her throat. A

mass of tangled hair fell across her eyes; her arms hung

limply at her sides; small, modish riding hoots showed

beneath the hem of her skin, forlorn in their irresoluteness.

Her garments were sadly bedraggled; a pathetic

breast rose and fell in choking sobs and gasps.
Suddenly he started forward, his eyes wide and staring.

He had seen that grey riding habit before! He had seen

the hair!
Two eager steps he took and then halted, half way. She

had heard him and was raising her eyes, bewildered and

wavering between dreamland and reality.
"Great Jehovah!" he gasped, unbelieving. "You? My

God, is it you?"
He dropped to his knees before her, peering into her

startled eyes. A look of abject terror crossed the tired,

tear-stained face. She shrank away from him, shivering,

whimpering like a cowed child.
"What is it? Where am I?" she moaned. "Oh, let me

go! What have I done, that you should bring me here?

Let me go, Mr. King! You are not so wicked as—"
"I? I bring you here?" he interrupted, aghast. Then

he understood. Utter dismay filled his eyes. "You

think that I have done this thing to you? God above

us! Look! I, too, am a prisoner here. I've been here

for days, weeks, years. They are going to kill me after

to-morrow. And you think that I have done this to

you!"
"I don't know what—Oh, Mr. King, what does it all

mean? Forgive me! I see now. You are bound—you

are suffering—you are years older. I see now. But

why is it? What have you done? What have I done?"
She was growing hysterical with terror.
"Don't shrink from me," he urged. "Try to calm yourself.

Try to look upon me as a friend—as a possible

saviour. Lie quiet, do, for a little while. Think it all

out for yourself."
He knelt there before her while she sobbed out the last

agony of alarm. There were no tears in her eyes; racking

sobs shook her slender body; every nerve was aquiver,

he could see. Patiently he waited, never taking his firm,

encouraging gaze from her face. She grew calmer,

more rational. Then, with the utmost gentleness, he

persuaded her to rise and walk about the little room with

him.
"It will give you strength and courage," he urged.

"Poor little girl! Poor little girl!"
She looked up into his face, a new light coming into

her eyes.
"Don't talk now," he said softly. "Take your time.

Hold to my arm, please. There! In a little while you'll

be able to tell me all about it—and then we'll set about

to find a way to escape these devils. We'll laugh at

'em, after all."
For five or ten minutes he led her back and forth across

the room, very tenderly. At first she was faint and uncertain;

then, as her strength and wits came back to her,

courage took the place of despair. She smiled wanly and

asked him to sit down with her.
"A way to escape, you said," she murmured, as he

dropped to her side. "Where are we? What is it all

about?"
"Not so loud," he cautioned. "I'll be perfectly candid

with you. You'll have to be very, very brave. But wait.

Perhaps it will be easier for you to tell me what has

happened to you, so far as you know. I can throw light

on the whole situation, I think. Tell me, please, in your

own way and time. We're in a sorry mess, and it looks

black, but, this much I can tell you: you are to be set

free in a few days, unharmed. You may rest easy.

That much is assured."
"And you?" she whispered, clutching his arm tightly,

the swift thrill of relief dying almost as it was born.

"What of you?"
"Oh, I'll get out all right," he affirmed with a confidence

he did not feel. "I'm going to get you out of

this or die in the attempt. Sh! Don't oppose me," he

went on whimsically. "I've always wanted to be a hero,

and here's my chance. Now tell me what happened to

you."
Her piquant, ever-sprightly face had lost the arrogance

that had troubled all his dreams of conquest. She

was pale and shivering and so sorely distressed that he

had it in his heart to clasp her in his arms as one might

do in trying to soothe a frightened child. Her face

grew cloudy with the effort to concentrate her thoughts;

a piteous frown settled upon her brow.
"I'm not sure that I can recall everything. It is all

so terrible—so unaccountable. It's like a dream that

you try to remember and cannot. Finding you here

in this place is really the strangest part of it. I cannot

believe that I am awake."
She looked long and anxiously into his face, her eyebrows

drawn together in an earnest squint of uncertainty.

"Oh, Mr. King, I have had such a dreadful—dreadful

time. Am I awake?"
"That's what I've been asking of myself," he murmured.

"I guess we're both awake all right. Nightmares

don't last forever."
Her story came haltingly; he was obliged to supply

many of the details by conjecture, she was so hazy and

vague in her memory.
At the beginning of the narrative, however, Truxton

was raised to unusual heights; he felt such a thrill of

exaltation that for the moment he forgot his and her

immediate peril. In a perfectly matter-of-fact manner

she was informing him that her search for him had not

been abandoned until Baron Dangloss received a telegram

from Paris, stating that King was in a hospital

there, recovering from a wound in the head.
"You can imagine what I thought when I saw you here

a little while, ago," she said, again looking hard at his

face as if to make sure. "We had looked everywhere

for you. You see, I was ashamed. That man from

Cook's told us that you were hurt by—by the way I

treated you the day before you disappeared, and—well,

he said you talked very foolishly about it."
He drew a long breath. Somehow he was happier than

he had been before. "Hobbs is a dreadful ass," he

managed to say.
It seems that the ministry was curiously disturbed by

the events attending the disappearance of the Countess

Ingomede. The deception practised upon John Tullis,

frustrated only by the receipt of a genuine message

from the Countess, was enough to convince the authorities

that something serious was afoot. It may have

meant no more than the assassination of Tullis at the

hands of a jealous husband; or it may have been a part

of the vast conspiracy which Dangloss now believed

to be in progress of development.
"Development!" Truxton King had exclaimed at this

point in her narrative. "Good God, if Dangloss only

knew what I know!"
There had been a second brief message from the Countess.

She admitted that she was with her husband at

the Axphain capital. This message came to Tullis and

was to the effect that she and the Count were leaving

almost immediately for a stay at Biarritz in France.

"Mr. King," said the narrator, "the Countess lied. They

did not go to Biarritz. I am convinced now that she is

in the plot with that vile old man. She may even expect

to reign in Graustark some day if his plans are carried

out. I saw Count Marlanx yesterday. He was in Graustark.

I knew him by the portrait that hangs in the

Duke of Perse's house—the portrait that Ingomede always

frowns at when I mention it to her. So, they did

not go to France."
She was becoming excited. Her eyes flashed; she spoke

rapidly. On the morning of the 23d she had gone for

her gallop in the famous Ganlook road, attended by two

faithful grooms from the Royal stables.
"I was in for a longer ride than usual," she said, with

sudden constraint. She looked away from her eager

listener. "I was nervous and had not slept the night

before. A girl never does, I suppose."
He looked askance. "Yes?" he queried.
She was blushing, he was sure of it. "I mean a girl is

always nervous and distrait after—after she has promised,

don't you see."
"No, I don't see."
"I had promised Count Vos Engo the night before that

I—Oh, but it really has nothing to do with the story.

I—"
Truxton was actually glaring at her. "You mean that

you had promised to marry Count Vos Engo!" he stammered.
"We will not discuss—"
"But did you promise to be his wife? Is he the man

you love?" he insisted. She stared at him in surprise

and no little resentment.
"I beg of you, Mr. King—" she began, but he interrupted

her.
"Forgive me. I'm a fool. Don't mind me." He sank

back against the wall, the picture of dejection. "It

doesn't matter, anyway. I've got to die in a day or

two, so what's the odds?"
"How very strangely you talk. Are you sure—I mean,

do you think it is fever? One suffers so—"
He sighed deeply. "Well, that's over! Whew! It

was a dream, by Jove!"
"I don't understand."
"Please go on."
She waited a moment and then, looking down, said

very gently: "I'm so sorry for you." He laughed, for

he thought she pitied him because he had awakened from

the dream.
Then she resumed her story, not to be interrupted

again. He seemed to have lost all interest.
She had gone six or eight miles down the Ganlook

road when she came up with five troopers of the Royal

Guard. It was a lonely spot at the junction of the King's

Highway and the road to the mines. One of the troopers

came forward and respectfully requested her to turn

off into the mine road until a detachment passed, in

charge of a gang of desperadoes taken at the Inn of

the Hawk and Raven the night before. Unsuspecting,

she rode off into the forest lane for several hundred

yards.
It was a trap. The men were not troopers, but brigands

gotten up in the uniform of the guard. Once

away from the main highway, they made prisoners of

her and the two grooms. Then followed a long ride

through roads new to her. At noon they came to a halt

while the rascals changed their clothing, appearing in

their true garb, that of the mountaineer. Half dead

with dread, she heard them discussing their plans; they

spoke quite freely in the presence of the well-beaten

grooms, who were led to expect death before many

hours. It was the design of the bandits to make their

way to the almost impregnable fastnesses in the hills of

Dawsbergen, the wild principality to the south. There

they could hold her against all hope of rescue, until an

immense sum of money was paid over in ransom by her

dispairing friends.
When night came they were high in the mountains

back of the Monastery, many hours ahead of any pursuit.

They became stupidly careless, and the two grooms

made a dash for freedom. One of them was killed, but

the other escaped. She was afterward to recall that no

effort was made to recapture him; they deliberately allowed

him to escape, their cunning purpose becoming

only too apparent later on.
Instead of hurrying on to Dawsbergen, they dropped

swiftly down into the valley above the city. No secret

was made of the ruse they had employed to mislead the

prospective pursuers. The rescue party, they swore

joyously, would naturally be led by John Tullis; he

would go with all haste to the Dawsbergen hills.

The word of the trusty groom would be taken as

positive proof that the captive was in that country.

She shuddered as she listened to their exultant chuckles.

It had been a most cunningly conceived plan

and it promised to result profitably for them in the

end.
Some time during the slow, torturing ride through the

forest she swooned. When she came to her senses she

was in a dimly lighted room, surrounded by men. The

gag had been removed from her mouth. She would

have shrieked out in her terror, had not her gaze rested

upon the figure of a man who sat opposite, his elbows on

the back of the chair which he straddled, his chin on his

arms. He was staring at her steadily, his black eyes

catching her gaze and holding it as a snake holds the

bird it has charmed.
She recognised the hard, hawk-like face. There could

be no mistake. She was looking into the face that made

the portrait of the Iron Count so abhorrent to her: the

leathery head of a cadaver with eyes that lived. A portrait

of Voltaire, the likeness of a satyr, a suggestion of

Satan—all rushed up from memory's storehouse to hold

her attention rapt in contemplation of this sinister

figure.
He smiled. It was like the crumpling of soft leather.

Then, with a word to one of the men, he abruptly left

the room. After that she broke down and cried herself

into the sleep of exhaustion.
All the next day she sat limp and helpless in the chair

they had brought to her. She could neither eat nor drink.

Late in the afternoon Marlanx came again. She knew

not from whence he came: he stood before her suddenly,

as if produced by the magic of some fabled genie, smiling

blandly, his hands clasped behind his back, his attitude

one of lecherous calculation.
Truxton King ground his teeth with rage and despair

while she was breathlessly repeating the suave compliments

that oozed from the lips of the tormentor.
"He laughed when I demanded that he should restore

me to my friends. He chided me when I pleaded and

begged for mercy. My questions were never answered.

He only said that no harm was to come to me; I was

merely touching purgatory that I might better appreciate

paradise when I came to it. Oh, it was horrible!

I thought I would go mad. Finally I called him a beast;

I don't know what else I said. He merely smiled. Presently

he called one of the men into the room. He said

something about a sewer and a hole in the ground. Then

the man went out and I heard the clicking of a telegraph

instrument. I heard certain instructions. I was to be

taken to a certain place in the city at nightfall and kept

there until to-morrow night, when I am again to be removed

by way of the river. That is all I know. Where

am I, Mr. King? Oh, this dreadful place! Why are

we here—you and I?"
King's heart throbbed fiercely one more. He was looking

straight into the piteous, wondering eyes; his gaze

fell to the parted, tremulous lips. A vast hunger possessed

his soul. In that moment he could have laid down

his life for her, with a smile of rejoicing.
Then he told her why she was there, why he was there—and

of the 26th. The dreadful 26th!
Her eyes grew wide with horror and understanding;

her bosom rose and fell rapidly with the sobs of suppressed

terror. At last he had finished his stupefying

tale; they sat side by side staring into each other's eyes,

helpless, stricken.
"God in heaven!" she repeated over and over again, in

a piteous whisper.
The candle flickered with feeble interest in the shadows

that began to grow in the farthest corner. The

girl drew closer to the side of the strong yet powerless

man. Their gaze went to the sputtering candle. It was

going out and they would be in utter darkness. And yet

neither thought of the supply of fresh candles in the

corner.
King brought himself out of the strange lethargy with

a jerk. It was high time, for the light was going.
"Quick!" he cried. "The candle! Light a fresh one.

My hands are bound."
She crept to the candles and joined the wicks. A new

light grew as the old one died. Then she stood erect,

looking down upon him.
"You are bound. I forgot."
She started forward, dropping to her knees beside

him, an eager gleam in her eyes. "If I can untie the

rope—will that help? Can you do anything? You are

strong. There must be a way. There must be one little

chance for you—for us. Let me try."
"By Jove," he whispered admiringly, his spirits leaping

to meet hers. "You've got pluck. You put new life in

me. I—I was almost a—a quitter."
"You have been here so long," she explained quickly.

"And tied all these days." She was tugging at the knot.
"Only since I gave that pleasant punch to Peter

Brutus."
"That shows what you can do," she whispered warmly.

"Oh, I wonder! I wonder if we have a chance! Anyway,

your arms will be free. I shall feel safer if your

arms are free."
He sat with his back to her while she struggled with

the stubborn knots. A delicious thrill of pleasure swept

over him. She had said she would feel safer if his arms

were free! She was struggling, with many a tense

straining of delicate fingers, to undo the bonds which

held him helpless. The touch of her eager fingers, the

closeness of her body, the warmth of her breathing—he

was beginning to hope that the effort might be prolonged

interminably.
At last, after many despairing tugs, the knot relaxed.

"There!" she cried, sinking back exhausted. "Oh, how

it must have hurt you! Your wrists are raw!"
He suppressed the tactless impulse to say that he preferred

a rope on the wrists to one about his neck,

realising that the jest could only shock and not amuse

her under the present conditions.
His arms were stiff and sore and hung like lead at his

sides. She watched him, with narrowed eyes, while he

stood off and tried to work blood and strength back into

his muscles.
"Do you think you can—can do anything now, Mr.

King?" she asked, after a long interval.
He would not tell her how helpless he was, even with

his hands free. So he smiled bravely and sought to reassure

her with the most imposing boasts he could utter.

She began to breathe easier; the light in her eyes grew

brighter, more hopeful.
"We must escape," she said, as if it were all settled.
"It cannot be to-night," he gently informed her, a

sickness attacking her heart. "Don't you think you'd

better try to get some sleep?"
He prevailed upon her to lie down, with his coat for a

pillow. In two minutes she was asleep.
For an hour or more he sat there, looking sorrowfully

at the tired, sweet face, the utmost despair in his soul.

At last he stretched himself out on the floor, near the

door, and as he went to sleep he prayed that Providence

might open a way for him to prove that she was not

depending on him in vain.

CHAPTER XIII
A DIVINITY SHAPES
It was pitch dark when he awoke.
"By heaven, it was a dream, after all," he murmured.

"Well, thank God for that. She isn't in this damnable

hole. And," with a quickening of the blood, "she hasn't

said she was going to marry Vos Engo."
The sound of light breathing came to his ears. He sat

up. His hands were free. It had not been a dream. She

was lying over there asleep. The candle had burnt itself

out, that was all. He crept softly across the floor; in

the darkness he found her, and touched the garments

she wore—and drew back enthralled. A strange joy

filled him; she was his for the time being. They were

equals in this direful, unlovely place; royal prejudice

stood for nothing here. The mad desire to pick her up

in his arms and hold her close came over him—only to

perish as quickly as it flamed. What was he thinking

of?
She stirred restlessly as he crept back to the door. The

sharp, quick intake of her breath told him that she was

awake. He stopped and utter silence fell upon the room.
A little moan escaped her lips: "Who is it? Why is

it so dark? What—"
"It is I," he whispered eagerly. "King. Don't be

afraid. The candle burnt out while we were asleep. I

did not intend to sleep. I'm sorry. We can't have a

light now until some one comes in the morning. Don't

be afraid."
"I am afraid. Where are you?"
"Here!" He hastened to her side. As he came up she

touched his face with her hand timorously. He caught

the wayward fingers in his own and held them, drawing

quite close to her. "It's all right," he said.
"Will they come soon?"
"I hope not—I mean, yes; it must be morning."
"I loathe the dark," she sighed. Presently her head

dropped over against his shoulder and she was asleep

again.
"I don't give a damn if they never come," thought

Truxton King, intoxicated with bliss.
Afraid to move for fear of disturbing her, he sat there

for an hour or more his back twisted and uncomfortable,

but never so resolute. He would not have moved

for all the world.
All this time his brain was working like mad in the

new-found desire to perform miracles for the sake of

this lovely, unattainable creature. Was there no way

to foil these triumphant conspirators? He was forgetting

the Prince, the horrors of the 26th; he was thinking

only of saving this girl from the fate that Marlanx

had in store for her. Vos Engo may have had the

promise, but what could it profit him if Marlanx had the

girl?
"I've got about as much chance as a snowball," he reflected,

courage and decision growing stronger each moment.

"I might just as well die one way as another. If

I could only catch 'em napping for a minute, I might

turn the trick. God, that would be—" he was lost in

ecstatic contemplation of the glory that such an event

would bring.
Footsteps in the outer room recalled him to the bitter

reality of their position. He awoke her and whispered

words of encouragement into her bewildered ears. Then

he put on his coat and threw himself on the floor, first

wrapping the rope about his wrists to deceive the

guard.
A key turned in the padlock and the bolt was raised.

Old man Spantz stood in the doorway, peering in at

them. In surly tones Truxton replied to his sharp

query, saying that the candle had gone out while he

slept.
"It is noon," said the old man irascibly. Then he came

in and lighted a candle.
"Noon of the 25th," said Truxton bitterly. "In

twenty-four hours it will be all over, eh, Spantz?"
"At noon to-morrow," said Spantz grimly.
There were half a dozen men in the outer room, conversing

in low, excited tones; the fervent gesticulations

which usually marked their discussions were missing,

proving the constraint that had descended upon them.

One of them—it was Julius Spantz—brought in the

food for the prisoners, setting it on the floor between

them.
"It is usually the duty of our friend Julius to feed

me," observed Truxton to his fellow-prisoner. "I dare

say he won't mind if you relieve him of the task."
"She can feed you if she likes," growled Julius.
"Julius?" queried the girl from the Castle, peering at

the man. "Not Julius Spantz, of the armoury?"
"The same," said Truxton. Julius laughed awkwardly

and withdrew. "Son of our distinguished host here.

Permit me to present Herr William—"
"Enough," snarled William Spantz, with a threatening

movement toward King. His manner changed completely,

however, when he turned to address the young

lady. "I beg to inform you, madam, that your stay in

this unwholesome place is to be brief. Pray endure it

for the remainder of this day. To-night you will be

removed to more pleasant quarters, that a friend has

prepared for you. I may say to you, however, that it

will he necessary to place a gag in your mouth before

you depart. This is to be a critical night in our affairs."

He lifted an inspired gaze heavenward. "Let me assure

you, madam, that the two gentlemen who are to conduct

you to the Count's—to your new quarters, are considerate,

kindly men; you need feel no further alarm. I am

requested to tell you this, so that you may rest easy for

the balance of the day. As for you, my friend," turning

to Truxton and smiling ironically, "I deeply deplore

the fact that you are to remain. You may be lonesome in

the dead hours, for, as you may imagine, we, your dearest

friends, will be off about a certain business that is known

to you, if I mistake not in believing that you have

listened at the door these many nights. When we next

gather in the room beyond, a new dispensation will have

begun. You may be interested then to hear what we

have to say—out there."
Truxton was silent for a moment, a sudden, swift

thought flooding his brain. Controlling the quiver of

anticipation in his voice, he took occasion to say:
"I only hope you'll not forget to come back. I should

be lonesome, Spantz."
"Oh, we'll not forget you."
"I suppose not. By the way, would you mind telling

me what has become of your niece?"
Spantz glared at him. "She does not meet with us

now. My niece is consecrating her every thought to

the task that lies before her. You will not see her again."
"It's an infernal shame, that's what it is," exclaimed

King, "to put it all upon that poor girl! God, I'd give

ten years of my life to lead her out of this devil's mess.

She's too good for—for that. It's—"
"She will be out of it, as you say, to-morrow, my

excellent Samaritan. She knows." There could be no

mistake as to the meaning of the prophetic words.
With a profound bow to the lady and a leer for King,

he departed, bolting the door behind him. Instantly

King was at her side.
"An idea has come to me," he whispered eagerly. "I

think I see a way. By George, if it should only happen

as I hope it may!"
"Tell me!" she insisted.
"Not now. I must think it all out carefully. It won't

do to get your hopes up and then fail."
Whatever the thought was that had come to him, it

certainly had put new life and hope into him. She nibbled

at the unwholesome food, never removing her eyes

from his tall, restless figure as he paced the floor, his

brows knit in thought. Finally he sat down beside her,

calmly helping himself to a huge slice of bread and a

boiled carrot.
"I've never liked carrots before. I love 'em now. I'm

taking them for my complexion."
"Don't jest, Mr. King. What is it you intend to do?

Please tell me. I must know. You heard what he said

about taking me to the Count's. He meant Marlanx.

I will die first."
"No. I will die first. By the way, I may as well tell

you that I wasn't thinking altogether of how we are to

escape. There was something else on my mind." He

stopped and looked at her puzzled face. "Why should

I save you from Marlanx just to have you hurry off

and get married to Vos Engo? It's a mean thought, I

know," hastily, "and unworthy of a typical hero, but,

just the same, I hate to think of you marrying some

one—else."
"Some one else?" she questioned, a pucker on her forehead.
"Oh, I know I wouldn't have a ghost of a chance, even

if there wasn't a Vos Engo. It isn't that," he explained.

"I recognise the—er—difference in our stations

and—"
"Are you crazy, Mr. King?"
"Not now. I was a bit touched, I think, but I'm over

it now. I dare say it was caused by excessive reading

of improbable romances. Life rather takes it out of a

fellow, don't you know. It's all simple enough in books,

but in—"
"What has all this got to do with your plan to escape?"
"Nothing at all. It merely has to do with my ambition

to become a true hero. You see, I'm an amateur hero.

Of course, this is good practice for me; in time, I may

become an expert and have no difficulty in winning a

duchess or even a princess. Don't misunderstand me.

I intend to do all I can toward rescuing you to-night.

The point I'm trying to get at is this: don't you think

it's pretty rough on a hero to save the girl for some

other fellow to snap up and marry?"
"I think I begin to see," she said, a touch of pink

coming into her cheeks.
"That's encouraging," he said, staring gloomily at the

food he had put aside. "You are quite sure you

promised Vos Engo that you'd marry him?"
"No. I did not promise him that I'd marry him," she

said, leaning back and surveying him between narrowed

lids.
"I beg your pardon. You said you had promised—"
"You did not allow me time to finish. I meant to say

that I had promised to let him know in a day or two.

That is all, Mr. King." There was a suspicious tremor

in her voice and her gaze wavered beneath his unbelieving

stare.
"What's that?" he demanded. "You—you don't mean

to say that—Oh, Lord! I wonder! I wonder if I have

a chance—just a ghost of a chance?" He leaned very

close, incredulous, fascinated. "What is it that you

are going to let him know? Yes or no?"
"That was the question I was considering when the

brigands caught me," she answered, meeting his gaze

fairly. "I haven't thought of it since."
"Of course, he is in your own class," said Truxton

glumly.
She hesitated an instant, her face growing very serious.

"Mr. King, has no one told you my name—who I am?"

she asked.
"You are the Prince's aunt, that's all I know."
"No more his aunt in reality than Jack Tullis is his

uncle. I thought you understood."
"Who are you, then?"
"I am Jack Tullis's sister, a New Yorker bred and

born, and I live not more than two blocks from

your—"
"For the love of—" he began blankly; then words

failed him, which was just as well. He gulped twice,

joy or unbelief choking him. The smile that crept into

her face dazzled him; he stared at her in speechless

amazement. "Then—then, you are not a duchess or

a—" he began again.
"Not at all. A very plain New Yorker," she said,

laughing aloud in sudden hysteria. For some reason she

drew quickly away from him. "You are not disappointed,

are you? Does it spoil your romance to—"
"Spoil it? Disappointed? No! By George, I—I

can't believe that any such luck—no, no, I don't mean it

just that way! Let me think it out. Let me get it

through my head." He leaned back against the wall

and devoured her with eager, disturbing eyes. "You are

Tullis's sister? You live near—Oh, I say, this is glorious!"

He arose and took a turn about the room. In

some nervousness and uncertainty she also came to her

feet, watching him wonderingly. He hurried back to

her, a new light in his eyes. She was very desirable,

this slender, uncertain person in the crumpled grey.
"Miss Tullis," he said, a thrill in his voice, "you are

a princess, just the same. I never was so happy in my

life as I am this minute. It isn't so black as it was. I

thought I couldn't win you because you—"
"Win me?" she gasped, her lips parted in wonder.
"Precisely. Now I'm looking at it differently. I

don't mind telling you that I'm in love with you—desperately

in love. It's been so with me ever since that

day in the Park. I loved you as a duchess or a princess,

and without hope. Now, I—I—well, I'm going to

hope. Perhaps Vos Engo has the better of me just now,

but I'm in the lists with him—with all of them. If I

get you out of this place—and myself as well—I want

you to understand that from this very minute I am

trying to win you if it lies in the power of any American

to win a girl who has suitors among the nobility. Will—will

you give me a chance—just a ghost of a chance?

I'll try to do the rest."
"Are—are you really in earnest?" she murmured, composure

flying to the winds.
"Yes; terribly so," he said gently. "I mean every word

of it. I do love you."
"I—I cannot talk about it now, Mr. King," she fluttered,

moving away from him in a sudden panic. Presently

he went over to her. She was standing near the

candle, staring down at the flame with a strangely preoccupied

expression in her eyes.
"Forgive me," he said. "I was hasty, inconsiderate. I—"
"You quite took my breath away," she panted, looking

up at him with a queer little smile.
"I know," he murmured.
Her troubled gaze resumed its sober contemplation of

the flame.
"How was I to tell—" she began, but checked herself.

"Please, Mr. King, you won't say anything more to me

about—about it,—just now, will you? Shall we talk

of our plans for to-night? Tell me about them."
He lowered his eyes, suddenly disheartened. "I only

ask you to believe that I am desperately in earnest."
"I cannot comprehend how—I mean, it is so very wonderful.

You don't think me unappreciative, or mean,

do you?"
"Of course not. You are startled, that's all. I'm a

blundering fool. Still, you must agree that I was

frightfully bowled over when I found that you were not

what I thought. I couldn't hold back, that's all. By

Jove, isn't it wonderful? Here I've been looking all

over the world for you, only to find that you've been

living around the corner from me all these years! It's

positively staggering! Why," with a sudden burst of

his unquenchable buoyancy, "we might have been married

two years ago and saved all this trouble. Just think

of it!"
She smiled. "I do like you," she said warmly, giving

him her hand. He kissed it gallantly and stepped back—resolutely.
"That's something," he said with his humblest, most

conquering smile.
"You won't leave me to my fate because you think I'm

going to marry—some one else?"
He grew very sober. "Miss Tullis, you and I have one

chance in a thousand. You may as well know the truth."
"Oh, I can't bear the thought of that dreadful old

man," she cried, abject distress in her eyes.
He gritted his teeth and turned away. She went back

to the corner, dully rearranging the coat he had given

her for comfort. She handled it with a tenderness that

would have astonished the garment had it been capable

of understanding. For a long time she watched him in

silence as he paced to and fro like a caged lion. Twice

she heard him mutter: "An American girl—good

Lord," and she found herself smiling to herself—the

strange, vagrant smile that comes of wonder and self-gratification.
Late in the afternoon—long hours in which they had

spoken to each other with curious infrequency, each

a prey to sombre thoughts—their door was unlocked

and Anna Cromer appeared before them, accompanied

by two of the men. Crisply she commanded the girl to

come forth; she wanted to talk with her.
She was in the outer room for the better part of an

hour, listening to Anna Cromer and Madame Drovnask,

who dinned the praises of the great Count Marlanx into

her ears until she was ready to scream. They bathed

the girl's face and brushed her hair and freshened her

garments. It occurred to her that she was being prepared

for a visit of the redoubtable Marlanx himself,

and put the question plainly.
"No," said Anna Cromer. "He's not coming here.

You are going to him. He will not be Count Marlanx

after to-morrow, but Citizen Marlanx—one of the

people, one of us. Ah, he is a big man to do this."
Little did they know Marlanx!
"Julius and Peter will come for you to-night," said

Madame Drovnask, with an evil, suggestive smile. "We

will not be here to say farewell, but, my dear, you will

be one of us before—well, before many days have

passed."
Truxton was beginning to tremble with the fear that

she would not be returned to their room, when the door

was opened and she came in—most gladly, he could see.

The two women bade him a cool, unmistakable Good-bye,

and left him in charge of the men who had just come

down from the shop above.
For half an hour Peter Brutus taunted him. It was

all he could do to keep his hands wrapped in the rope

behind his back; he was thankful when they returned

him to his cell. The time was not ripe for the dash he

was now determined to make.
"Get a little nap, if you can," he said to Loraine, when

the door was locked behind him. "It won't be long before

something happens. I've got a plan. You'll have

your part to play. God grant that it may work out

well for us. You—you might pray if—if—"
"Yes, I can pray," she said simply. "I'll do my part,

Mr. King."
He waited a moment. "We've been neighbours in New

York for years," he said. "Would you mind calling me

Truxton,—and for Adele's sake, too?"
"It isn't hard to do, Truxton."
"Good!" he exclaimed.
She rebelled at the mere thought of sleep, but, unfastening

her collar and removing the jabot, she made

herself a comfortable cushion of his coat and sat back

in her corner, strangely confident that this strong, eager

American would deliver her from the Philistines—this

fighting American with the ten days' growth of beard

on his erstwhile merry face.
Sometime in the tense, suffocating hours of the night

they heard the sounds of many footsteps shuffling about

the outer room; there were hoarse, guttural, subdued

good-byes and well-wishes, the creaking of heavy doors

and the dropping of bolts. Eventually King, who had

been listening alertly, realised that but two of the men

remained in the room—Peter Brutus and Julius Spantz.
An hour crept by, and another, seemingly interminable

King was fairly groaning under the suspense. The

time was slowly, too slowly approaching when he was

to attempt the most desperate act in all this sanguinary

tragedy—the last act for him, no doubt, but the one

in which he was to see himself glorified.
There remained the chance—the slim chance that only

Providence considers. He had prayed for strength and

cunning; she had prayed for divine intervention. But,

after all, Luck was to be the referee.
He had told her of his plan; she knew the part she was

to play. And if all went well—ah, then! He took a

strange lesson in the language of Graustark: one sentence,

that was all. She had whispered the translation

to him and he had grimly repeated it, over and over

again. "She has fainted, damn her!" It was to be their

"Open Sesame"—if all went well!
Suddenly he started to his feet, his jaws set, his eyes

gleaming. The telegraph instrument was clicking in

the outer room!
He had wrapped his handkerchief about his big right

hand, producing a sort of cushion to deaden the sound

of a blow with the fist and to protect his knuckles; for

all his strength was to go into that one mighty blow. If

both men came into the room, his chance was smaller;

but, in either event, the first blow was to be a mighty

one.
Taking his position near the girl, who was crouching

in real dismay, he leaned against the wall, his hands behind

him, every muscle strained and taut.
The door opened and Julius Spantz, bewhiskered and

awkward, entered. He wore a raincoat and storm hat,

and carried a rope in one of his hands. He stopped just

inside the door to survey the picture.
"Time you were asleep," he said stupidly, addressing

King.
"I'd put you to sleep, Julius, if Miss Tullis could have

managed to untie these infernal bonds," said Truxton,

with pleasant daring.
"I don't tie lovers' knots," grinned Julius, pleased with

his own wit. "Come, madam, I must ask you to stand

up. Will you put your own handkerchief in your mouth,

or must I use force—ah, that's good! I'm sorry, but

I must wrap this cloth about—"
He did not complete the sentence, for he had come

within range. The whole weight of Truxton King's

body was behind the terrific blow that landed on the

man's jaw. Loraine suppressed the scream that rose to

her white lips. Julius Spantz's knees crumpled; he

lunged against the wall and was sliding down when King

caught him in his arms. The man was stunned beyond

all power of immediate action. It was the work of an

instant to snatch the revolver from his coat pocket.
"Guard the door!" whispered King to the girl, pressing

the revolver into her hand. "And shoot if you have

to!"
A handkerchief was stuffed into the unconscious man's

mouth; the long coat and boots were jerked from his

limp body before his hands and feet were bound with the

rope he carried; the bushy whiskers and wig were removed

from his head and transferred in a flash to that

of the American. Then the boots, coat and hat found

a new wearer.
Peter Brutus was standing in the stairway, leading to

the sewer, listening eagerly for sounds from either side.
"Hurry up, Julius," he called imperatively. "They

are below with the boat. They have given the signal."
The new Julius uttered a single sentence; that was all.

If Peter heard the noise attending the disposal of his

comrade, he was justified in believing that the girl had

offered some resistance. When a tall, grunting man

emerged from the inner room, bearing the limp figure

of a girl in a frayed raincoat, he did not wait to ask

questions, but rushed over and locked the cell-door. Then

he led the way down the narrow stairway, lighting the

passage with a candle. His only reply to King's guttural

remark in the Graustark language was:
"Don't speak, you fool! Not a word until we reach

the river."
Down the steps they went to the opening in the wall of

the sewer. There, before the bolts were drawn by Brutus,

a series of raps were exchanged by men outside and

the one who held the keys within.
A moment later, the girl was being lowered through the

hole into rough, eager arms. Brutus and his companion

dropped through, the secret block of masonry

was closed, and off through the shallow waters of the

sewer glided the party riverward in the noiseless boat

that had come up to ferry them.
There were three men in the boat, not counting Truxton

King.

CHAPTER XIV
ON THE RIVER
No word was spoken during this cautious, extraordinary

voyage underground. The boat drifted slowly through

the narrow channel, unlighted and practically unguided.

Two of the men sat at the rowlocks, but the oars rested

idly in the boat. With their hands they kept the craft

from scraping against the walls.
The pseudo-Julius supported his charge in the stern

of the boat; Peter Brutus sat in the bow, a revolver in

his hand, his gaze bent upon the opaqueness ahead. A

whispered word of encouragement now and then passed

from the lips of the hopeful American into the ear of the

almost pulseless girl, who lay up against his knee.
"We'll do it—sure!" he whispered once, ever so softly.
"Yes," she scarcely, breathed, but he heard and was

thrilled. The rope had dropped from her arms; she

had taken the handkerchief from her mouth at his whispered

command.
At last the boat crept out into the rainy, starless night.

He drew the skirts of his own mackintosh over her

shoulders and head. A subdued command came from the

man in the bow; the oars slipped into the deep, black

waters of the river; without a splash or a perceptible

sound the little craft scudded toward midstream. The

night was so inky black that one could not see his hand

before his face.
At least two of the occupants opened up their throats

and lungs and gulped in the wet, fresh air. Never had

anything been so glorious to Truxton King as these first

tremendous inhalations of pure, free air. She felt his

muscles expand; his whole body grew stronger and more

vital. Her heart was pounding violently against his

leg; he could feel its throbs, he could hear the quick,

eager panting of her breath.
It was now that he began to wonder, to calculate

against the plans of their silent escort. Whither were

they bound? When would his chance come to strike

the final, surprising blow? Only the greatest effort at

self-control kept him from ruining everything by premature

action; his exultation was getting the better of

him. Coolness and patience were greater assets now

than strength and daring.
The boat turned in mid-stream and shot swiftly up the

river, past the black fortress with its scattered sentry

lights, where slept a garrison in sweet ignorance of the

tragedy that was to come upon them when the sun was

high. The lights of the city itself soon peeped down

into the rain-swept waters; music from the distant cafés

came faintly to the ears of the midnight voyagers. A

safe haven at their very elbows, and yet unattainable.
The occasional creak of an oar, a whispered oath of

dismay, the heavy breathing of toilers, the soft blowing

of the mist-that was all; no other sound on the broad,

still river. It was, indeed, a night fit for the undertaking

at hand.
Truxton began to chafe under the strain. His uneasiness

was increased by the certain conviction that before

long they would be beyond the city, the walls of

which were gradually slipping past He could not even

so much as guess at their destination. There was also

the likelihood of encountering reinforcements, sent out

to meet the boatmen, or for protection at the time of

landing. A hundred doubts and misgivings assailed

him. To suddenly open fire on the rascals went against

the grain. A dashing, running fight on shore was more

to his liking. An ill-timed move would foil them even as

success was in their grasp.
He considered their chances if he were to overturn the

frail boat and strike out for shore in the darkness. This

project he gave up at once: he did not know the waters

nor the banks between which they glided. They were

past the walls now and rowing less stealthily. Before

long they would be in a position to speak aloud; it

would be awkward for him. The situation was rapidly

growing more and more desperate; the time was near at

hand when the final effort would have to be exerted. He

slipped the revolver from his pocket; somehow he was

unable to keep his teeth from chattering; but it was

through excitement, not fear.
Suddenly the boat turned to the right and shot toward

the unseen bank. They were perhaps half a mile above

the city wall. Truxton's mind was working like a trip-hammer.

He was recalling a certain nomad settlement

north of the city, the quarters of fishermen, poachers and

horse-traders: a squalid, unclean community that lay

under the walls between the northern gates and the

river. These people, he was not slow to surmise, were

undoubtedly hand in glove with Marlanx, if not so

surely connected with the misguided Committee of Ten.

This being the eve of the great uprising, it was not

unlikely that a secret host lay here awake and ready for

the foul observance of the coming holiday; here, at

least, chafed an eager, vicious, law-hating community

of mendicants and outcasts.
He had little time to speculate on the attitude of the

denizens of this unwholesome place. The prow of the

boat grated on the pebbly bank, and Peter Brutus

leaped over the edge into the shallow water.
"Come on, Julius—hand her over to me!" he cried,

making his way to the stern.
As he leaned over the side to seize the girl in his arms,

Truxton King brought the butt of the heavy revolver

down upon his skull. Brutus dropped across the gunwale

with a groan, dead to all that was to happen in the

next half hour or more.
King was anxious to avoid the hullaballoo that shooting

was sure to create on shore. Action had been forced

upon him rather precipitously, but he was ready. Leaning

forward, he had the two amazed oarsmen covered

with the weapon.
"Hands up! Quick!" he cried. Two pairs of hands

went up, together with strange oaths. Truxton's eyes

had grown used to the darkness; he could see the men

quite plainly. "What are you doing?" he demanded of

Loraine, who, behind him, was fumbling in the garments

of the unconscious Brutus.
"Getting his revolver," she replied, with a quaver in

her voice.
"Good!" he said exultantly. "Let's think a minute,"

he went on. "We don't dare turn these fellows loose,

even if we disarm them. They'll have a crowd after us

in two minutes." Still, keeping the men covered, he

cudgelled his brain for the means of disposing of them.

"I have it. We must disarm them, tie them up and set

'em adrift. Do you mind getting out into the water?

It's ankle deep, that's all. I'll keep them covered while

you take their guns."
"Nice way to treat a friend," growled one of the men.
"A friend? By George, it's my Newport acquaintance.

Well, this is a pleasure! I suppose you know that I'll

shoot if you resist. Better take it quietly."
"Oh, you'll shoot, all right," said the other. "I told

them damn fools that a Yankee'd get the better of 'em,

even if they ran a steam roller over him two or three

times. Say, you're a pippin! I'd like to take off my

hat to you."
"Don't bother. I acknowledge the tribute."
Loraine Tullis was in the water by this time. With

nervous haste she obeyed King's instructions; the big

revolvers were passed back to him.
"I've changed my mind," said Truxton' suddenly.

"We'll keep the boat. Get in, Miss Tullis. There!

Now, push off, Newport."
"What the devil—" began Newport, but King silenced

him. The boat slowly drifted out into the current.
"Now, row!" he commanded. With his free hand he

reached back and dragged the limp Brutus into the

boat. "'Gad, I believe he's dead," he muttered.
For five minutes the surly oarsmen pulled away, headed

in the direction from which they came.
"Can you swim?" demanded King.
"Not a stroke," gasped Newport. "Good Lord, pal,

you're not going to dump us overboard. It's ten feet

deep along here."
"Pull on your left, hard. That's right. I'm going

to land you on the opposite shore-and then bid you a

cheerful good-night."
Two minutes later they ran up under the western bank

of the stream, which at this point was fully three hundred

yards wide. The nearest bridge was a mile and a

half away and habitations were scarce, as he well knew.

Under cover of the deadly revolver, the two men dropped

into the water, which was above their waists; the limp

form of Peter Brutus was pulled out and transferred to

the shoulders of his companions.
"Good-night," called out Truxton King cheerily. He

had grasped the oars; the little boat leaped off into the

night, leaving the cursing desperadoes waist-deep in the

chilly waters.
"See you later," sang out Newport, with sudden

humour.
"We'll go south," said Truxton King to the girl who

sat in the stern, clutching the sides of the boat with

tense fingers. "I don't know just where we'll land, but

it won't be up in Devil's Patch, you may rest assured of

that. Pardon me if I do not indulge in small talk and

bonmots; I'm going to be otherwise employed for some

time, Miss Tullis. Do you know the river very well?"
"Not at all," she replied. "I only know that the barge

docks are below here somewhere. I'm sure we can get

into the city if we can find the docks. Let me take the

oars, too, Mr. King. I can row."
"No. Please sit where you are and keep your eyes

ahead. Can you see where we're going?"
"I can see the lights. We're in mid-stream, I think.

It's so very dark and the wind is coming up in a gale.

It's—it's going to storm. Don't you think we'd better

try for a landing along the walls? They say the river is

very treacherous." She was trembling like a leaf.
"I'll row over to the east side, but I don't like to get

too close to the walls. Some one may have heard the

shouts of our friends back there."
Not another word passed between them for ten or

twelve minutes. She peered anxiously ahead, looking for

signs of the barge dock, which lay somewhere along this

section of the city wall. In time, of course, the marooned

desperadoes might be expected to find a way to

pursue them, or, at least, to alarm watchful confederates

on the city side of the river. It was a tense, anxious

quarter of an hour for the liberated pair. So near to

absolute safety, and yet so utterly in the dark as to

what the next moment, might develop—weal or woe.
At least the sound of rapidly working rowlocks came

to the girl's ears. They were slipping along in the dense

blackness beneath the walls, making as little noise as

possible and constantly on the lookout for the long,

low dock.
"They're after us," grated Truxton, in desperation.

"They've got word to friends one way or another. By

Jove! I'm nearly fagged, too. I can't pull much farther.

Hello! What's this?"
The side of the boat caromed off' a solid object in the

water, almost spilling them into the wind-blown river.
"The docks!" she whispered. "We struck a small

scow, I think. Can you find your way in among the

coal barges?"
He paddled along slowly, feeling his way, scraping

alongside the big barges which delivered coal from the

distant mines to the docks along the river front. At

last he found an opening and pushed through. A moment

later they were riding under the stern of a broad,

cargoless barge, plumb up against the water-lapped

piles of the dock.
Standing in the bow of the boat he managed to pull

himself up over the slippery edge. It was the work of a

second to draw her up after him. With an oar which

he had thought to remove beforehand, he gave the boat

a mighty shove, sending it out into the stream once

more.
Then, hand in hand, they edged slowly, carefully along

the gravel-strewn dock, between vast piles of lumber and

steep walls of coal. It was only necessary to find the

railway company's runways leading into the yards

above; in time of peace there was little likelihood that

the entrances to the dock would be closed, even at night.
Loud curses came up from the river, proclaiming the

fact that the pursuers had found the empty boat. Afterwards

they were to learn that "Newport's" shouts had

brought a boatload of men from the opposite bank,

headed by the innkeeper, in whose place Loraine was to

have encountered Marlanx later on, if plans had not miscarried.

She was to have remained in this outside inn

until after the sacking of the city on the following day.

The girl translated one remark that came up to them

from the boatload of pursuers:
"The old man is waiting back there. He'll kill the lot

of us if we don't bring the girl."
By this time King had located the open space which

undoubtedly afforded room for the transfer of cargoes

from the dock to the company's yards inside the walls.

Without hesitation he drew her after him up this wide,

sinister roadway. They stumbled on over the rails of the

"dummy track," collided with collier trucks, slipped on

the soggy chutes, but all the while forged ahead toward

the gates that so surely lay above them.
The pursuers were trying for a landing, noisily, even

boisterously. It struck Truxton as queer that these

men were not afraid of alarming the watchmen on the

docks or the man at the gate above. Suddenly it came

to him that there would be no one there to oppose the

landing of the miscreants. No doubt hundreds of men

already had stolen through these gates during the night,

secreting themselves in the fastnesses of the city, ready

for the morrow's fray. It is no small wonder that he

shuddered at the thought of it.
There was no one on the wharf—at least, no one in

sight. They rushed up the narrow railway chutes and

through one of the numerous gateways that opened out

upon the barge docks. No one opposed them; no one

was standing guard. From behind came the sound of

rushing footsteps. Lightning flashed in the sky and

the rumble of thunder broke over the desolate night.
"They'll see us by the lightning," gasped Truxton,

almost ready to drop from faintness and exhaustion.

He was astounded, even alarmed, to find that his strength

had been so gravely depleted by confinement and lack

of nourishment.
They were inside the city walls. Ahead of them, in

that labyrinth of filthy streets lay the way to the distant

square. His arm was now about her waist, for she

was half-fainting; he could hear her gasping and moaning

softly, inarticulate cries of despair. Switch-lights

blinked in the distance. Off to the right of them windows

showed lights; the clang of a locomotive bell came

to them as from a great distance.
Their progress was abruptly halted by the appearance

of a man ahead, standing like a statue in the middle of

the network of tracks. They stumbled toward him, not

knowing whether he was friend or foe. One look into

their faces, aided by the flare of a yardman's lantern,

and the fellow turned tail and fled, shouting as he did

so.
Following a vivid flash of lightning, two shots were

fired by the men who were now plunging up through the

gates, a hundred yards or more away. The same flash

of lightning showed to King the narrow, muddy street

that stretched ahead of them, lined with low, ugly houses

of a nondescript character. Instead of doing the obvious

thing, he turned sharply to the left, between the

lines of freight cars. Their progress was slow; both

were ready to drop; the way was dark and unknown to

them.
At last they came to the end of their rope: they were

literally up against the great city wall! They had

reached the limits of the railway yards and were blocked

on all sides by they knew not how many rows of cars.

Somewhere off to the right there were streets and houses

and people, but they did not have the strength to try to

reach them.
A car door stood open in front of them. He waited

for a second flash of lightning to reveal to him the nature

of its interior. It was quite empty. Without

hesitation he clambered in and pulled her up after him.

They fell over, completely fagged.
A few minutes later the storm broke. He managed to

close the door against the driving torrents.
She was sobbing plaintively, poor, wet, bedraggled

sweetheart—he called her that, although she did not hear

him.
"We've fooled them," he managed to whisper, close to

her ear. "They won't look here. You're safe, Loraine.

'Gad, I'd like to see any one get you away from me

now."
She pressed his arm, that was all. He found himself

wondering what answer she would give to Vos Engo

when he took her to him to-morrow. To-morrow! This

was the 26th! Would there be a to-morrow for any of

them—for Vos Engo, for Tullis, for the Prince? For

her?
"There will be time to warn them in the morning," he

thought, dulled by fatigue. "We can't go on now."
"Truxton," he heard her saying, tremulously, "do you

think we can do anything for them—the Prince and

those who are with him? How can we lie here when

there is so much to be done?"
"When the storm abates—when we are rested—we

will try to get away from here. Those devils know that

I will give the alarm. They will have hundreds of men

watching to head us off. It means everything to them.

You see, I know their plans. But, Loraine, dear little

girl, brave as you are and willing as I am, we can't go

on until we've pulled ourselves together. We're safe

here for awhile. Later on, we'll try to steal up to the

city. They will be watching every approach to the

Castle and to the Tower, hoping to stop me in time.

We must out-fox them again. It will be harder, too,

little girl. But, if I don't do any more, I pledge you

that I'll save you from Marlanx."
"Oh, I know you will. You must, Truxton."
"I'd—I'd like to be sure that I am also saving you

from Vos Engo. I hate to think of you throwing yourself

away on one of these blithering, fortune-hunting

noblemen." She pressed his arm again. "By Jove, it's

great fun being a hero, after all—and it isn't so difficult,

if the girl helps you as you helped me. It's too

bad I couldn't do it all by myself. I have always counted

on rescuing you from an Ogre's castle or something of

that sort. It's rather commonplace as it is, don't you

think?"
"I don't—know what—you're talking about," she

murmured. Then she was fast asleep.
The storm raged; savage bursts of wind rocked the

little freight car; the rain hissed viciously against their

frail hotel; thunder roared and lightning rent sky and

earth. The weary night-farers slept with pandemonium

dinning in their ears.
He sat with his back against the side of the car, a,

pistol in one hand, the other lying tenderly upon the

drenched hair of the girl whose head rested upon his

leg. She had slipped down from his shoulder; he did

not have the desire or the energy to prevent it. At his

side lay the discarded whiskers. Manfully as he had

fought against the impelling desire to sleep, he could not

beat it off. His last waking thought was of the effort

he must make to reach Dangloss with the warning.
Then the storm abated; the soft drip of rain from the

eaves of the car beat a monotonous tattoo in the pools

below; the raw winds from the mountains blew stealthily

in the wake of the tornado, picking up the waste that

had been left behind only to cast it aside with a moan

of derision.
Something stirred in the far end of the car. A still,

small noise as of something alive that moved with the

utmost wariness. A heavy, breathing body crept

stealthily across the intervening space; so quietly that

a mouse could have made but little less noise.
Then it stopped; there was not a sound inside the car

except the deep, regular breathing of Truxton King.

The girl's respiration was so faint that one might have

thought she did not breathe at all. Again the sly, cautious

movement of a heavy body; the creaking of a joint

or two, the sound of a creature rising from a crouching

position to the upright; then the gentle rubbing of

cloth, the fumbling of fingers in a stubborn pocket.
An instant later the bluish flame of a sulphur match

struggled for life, growing stronger and brighter in the

hand of a man who stood above the sleepers.

CHAPTER XV
THE GIRL IN THE RED CLOAK
Inside of an hour after the return of the frightened,

quivering groom who had escaped from the brigands in

the hills, Jack Tullis was granted permission by the war

department to take a hundred picked men with him in the

effort to overtake and capture the abductors of his sister.

The dazed groom's story hardly had been told to the

horrified brother before he was engaged in telephoning

to General Braze and Baron Dangloss. A hurried consultation

followed. Other affairs that had been troubling

the authorities for days were forgotten in the face

of this distressing catastrophe; there was no time to be

lost if the desperadoes were to be headed before they succeeded

in reaching the Dawsbergen passes with their

lovely captive. Once there, it would be like hunting a

needle in a haystack; they could elude pursuit for days

among the wild crags of upper Dawsbergen, where none

but outlaws lived, and fierce beasts thrived.
Unluckily for the dearest hopes of the rescuing party,

the miserable groom did not reach the city until almost

noon of the day following the abduction. He had lost

his way and had wandered all night in the forests. When

Miss Tullis failed to return at nightfall, her brother,

having in mind the mysterious disappearance of Truxton

King and the flight of Countess Ingomede, was preparing

to set forth in search of her. A telephone message

from Ganlook, fifteen miles north of the city, came

at seven o'clock, just as he was leaving the Castle. The

speaker purported to be the Countess Prandeville, a very

estimable chatelaine who ruled socially over the grim old

village of Ganlook. She informed Tullis that his sister

was with her for the night, having arrived in the afternoon

with a "frightful headache." She would look after

the dear child, of whom she was very fond, and would

send her down in the morning, when she would surely be

herself again. Greatly relieved, Tullis gave up his plan

to ride off in quest of her; he knew the amiable Countess,

and felt that his sister was in good hands.
It was not until the return of the groom that he recalled

the fact that the voice on the telephone was not

quite like that of the Countess. He had been cleverly

hoodwinked. Baron Dangloss, obtaining connection

with the Prandeville household in Ganlook, at once discovered

that Loraine had not been in the chateau in

many days.
The fierce, cock-robin baron was sadly upset. Three

prominent persons had been stolen from beneath his nose,

so to speak. He was beside himself with rage and dismay.

This last outrage was the climax. The old man

adored the sister of Jack Tullis; he was heartbroken and

crushed by the news of the catastrophe. For a while he

worked as if in a daze; only the fierce spurring of Jack

Tullis and Vos Engo, who believed himself to be an accepted

suitor, awoke him from an unusual state of

lethargy. It is even said that the baron shed tears without

blowing his nose to discredit the emotion.
The city was soon to know of the fresh outrage at the

hands of the bandits in the hills. Great excitement prevailed;

there were many sincere lamentations, for the

beautiful American girl was a great favourite—especially

with those excellent persons who conducted bazaars in

the main avenues. Loraine, being an American, did not

hesitate to visit the shops in person: something that the

native ladies never thought of doing. Hundreds of

honest citizens volunteered to join in a search of the

hills, but the distinction was denied them.
The war department issued official notice to all merchants

that their places of business must be decorated

properly against the holiday that would occur on the

morrow. Shops were to be closed for two hours at midday,

during the ceremonies attending the unveiling of

the Yetive monument in the Plaza. The merchants

might well give their time to decorating their shops;

the soldiers could do all the searching and all the fighting

that was necessary. Strict orders, backed by

method, were issued to the effect that no one was to pass

through the gates during the day, except by special

permission from General Braze.
Count Vos Engo was eager to accompany the expedition

to Dawsbergen in search of his wayward lady-love.

Tullis, who liked the gay young nobleman despite the

reputation he had managed to live down, was willing that

he should be the one to lead the troops, but Colonel

Quinnox flatly refused to consider it.
"To-morrow's celebration in the city will demand the

attendance of every noble officer in the guard," he said.

"I cannot allow you to go, Count Vos Engo. Your

place is here, beside the Prince. Line officers may take

charge of this expedition to the hills; they will be amply

able to manage the chase. I am sorry that it happens

so. The Royal Guard, to a man, must ride with the

Prince to-morrow."
Captain Haas, of the dragoons, was put in charge of

the relief party, much to the disgust of Vos Engo;

and at two o'clock in the afternoon they were ready to

ride away. The party was armed and equipped for a

bitter chase. Word had been sent to Serros, the capital

of Dawsbergen, asking the assistance of Prince Dantan

in the effort to overtake the abductors. A detachment,

it was announced in reply, was to start from Serros during

the afternoon, bound for the eastern passes.
Baron Dangloss rode to the southern gate with the

white-faced, suffering Tullis. "We will undoubtedly receive

a communication from the rascals this afternoon

or to-morrow," he said gloomily. "They will not be

slow to make a formal demand for ransom, knowing that

you and your sister are possessed of unlimited wealth.

When this communication arrives it may give us a clue

to their whereabouts; certainly as to their methods. If

it should be necessary, Tullis, to apprise you of the

nature of this demand, I, myself, will ride post haste

to St. Michael's Pass, which you are bound to reach to-morrow

after your circuit of the upper gaps. It is

possible, you see, that an open attack on these fellows

may result in her—er—well, to be frank—her murder.

Damn them, they'd do it, you know. My place to-morrow

is here in the city. There may be disturbances.

Nothing serious, of course, but I am uneasy. There are

many strangers in the city and more are coming for the

holiday. The presence of the Prince at the unveiling of

the statue of his mother—God bless her soul!—is a

tremendous magnet. I would that you could be here

to-morrow, John Tullis; at Prince Robin's side, so to

speak."
"Poor little chap! He was terribly cut up when I told

him I was going. He wanted to come. Had his little

sword out, and all that. Said the celebration could be

postponed or go hang, either one. Look after him

closely to-morrow, Dangloss. I'd shoot myself if anything

were to happen to him. Marlanx is in the air; I

feel him, I give you my word, I do! I've been depressed

for days. As sure as there's a sun up yonder, that old

scoundrel is planning something desperate. Don't forget

that we've already learned a few things regarding

his designs." He waited a moment before uttering his

gravest fear. "Don't give him a chance to strike at

the Prince."
"He wouldn't dare to do that!"
"He'd dare anything, from what I've heard of him."
"You hate him because—"
"Go on! Yes, I hate him because he has made her

unhappy. Hello, who's this?"
A man who had ridden up to the gates, his horse covered

with foam, was demanding admission. The

warders halted him unceremoniously as Dangloss rode

forward. They found that he was one of the foremen

in the employ of the railway construction company. He

brought the disquieting news that another strike had

been declared, that the men were ugly and determined to

tear up the track already laid unless their demands were

considered, and, furthermore, that there had been severe

fighting between the two factions engaged on the work.

He urgently implored Dangloss to send troops out to

hold the rioters in check. Many of the men were demanding

their pay so that they might give up their

jobs and return to their own lands.
"What is your name?" demanded the harassed minister

of police.
"Polson," replied the foreman. He lied, for he was

no other than John Cromer, the unsavoury husband of

Anna Cromer, of the Committee of Ten.
"Come with me," said Dangloss. "We will go to

General Braze. Good-bye and good luck, Tullis."
The little baron rode back into the city, accompanied

by the shifty-eyed Cromer, while John Tullis sped off

to the south, riding swiftly by the side of the stern-faced

Captain Haas, an eager company of dragoons behind,

a mountain guide in front.
At that very moment, Loraine Tullis was comparing

notes with Truxton King in the room beneath the

armourer's shop; Count Marlanx was hiding in the

trader's inn outside the northern gates; the abductors

themselves were scattered about the city, laughing triumphantly

over the success of the ruse that had drawn

the well-feared American away on a wild-goose chase

to the distant passes of Dawsbergen. More than that:

at five o'clock in the afternoon a second detachment of

soldiers left the city for the scene of the riots in the

construction camps, twenty miles away.
Surely the well-laid plans of the Iron Count were being

skilfully carried out!
All afternoon and evening men straggled in from the

hills and surrounding country, apparently loth to miss

the early excitement attending the ceremonies on the

following day. Sullen strikers from the camps came

down, cursing the company but drinking noisy toasts

to the railroad and its future. The city by night

swarmed with revelling thousands; the bands were playing,

the crowds were singing, and mobs were drinking

and carousing in the lower end. The cold, drizzling rain

that began to blow across the city at ten o'clock did

little toward checking the hilarity of the revellers.

Honest citizens went to bed early, leaving the streets to

the strangers from the hills and the river-lands. Not

one dreamed of the ugly tragedy that was drawing to

a climax as he slept the sleep of the just, the secure, the

conscience-free.
At three o'clock in the morning word flew from brothel

to brothel, from lodging house to lodging house, in all

parts of the slumbering city; a thousand men crept out

into the streets after the storm, all animated by one impulse,

all obeying a single fierce injunction.
They were to find and kill a tall American! They

were to keep him or his companion from getting in

touch with the police authorities, or with the Royal

Castle, no matter what the cost!
The streets were soon alive with these alert, skulking

minions. Every approach to the points of danger was

guarded by desperate, heavily armed scoundrels who

would not have hesitated an instant if it came to their

hands to kill Truxton King, the man with all their

dearest secrets in his grasp. In dark doorways lounged

these apparently couchless strangers; in areaways and

alleys, on doorsteps they found shelter; in the main

streets and the side streets they roamed. All the time

they had an eager, evil eye out for a tall American and

a slender girl!
Dangloss's lynx-eyed constabulary kept close watch

over these restless, homeless strangers, constantly ordering

them to disperse, or to "move on," or to "find a bed,

not a doorstep." The commands were always obeyed;

churlishly, perhaps, in many instances, but never with

physical resistance.
At five o'clock, a stealthy whisper went the rounds,

reaching the ear of every vagabond and cutthroat engaged

in the untiring vigil. Like smoke they faded

away. The silent watch was over.
The word had sped to every corner of the town that

it was no longer necessary to maintain the watch for

Truxton King. He was no longer in a position to give

them trouble or uneasiness!
The twenty-sixth dawned bright and cool after the

savage storm from the north. Brisk breezes floated

down from the mountain peaks; an unreluctant sun

smiled his cheeriest from his seat behind the hills, warmly

awaiting the hour when he could peep above them for

a look into the gala nest of humanity on the western

slope. Everywhere there was activity, life, gladness

and good humour.
Gaudy decorations which had been torn away by the

storm were cheerfully replaced; workmen refurbished

the public stands and the Royal box in the Plaza; bands

paraded the avenues or gave concerts in Regengetz

Circus; troops of mounted soldiers and constabulary

patroled the streets. There was nothing to indicate to

the municipality that the vilest conspiracy of the age—of

any age—was gripping its tentacles about the city of

Edelweiss, the smiling, happy city of mountain and

valley. No one could have suspected guile in the laughter

and badinage that masked the manner of the men

who were there to spread disaster in the bunting-clad

thoroughfares.
"I don't like the looks of things," said Baron Dangloss,

time and again. His men were never so alert as

to-day and never so deceived.
"There can't be trouble of any sort," mused Colonel

Quinnox. "These fellows are ugly, 'tis true, but they

are not prepared for a demonstration. They are unarmed.

What could they do against the troops, even

though they are considerably depleted?"
"Colonel, we'll yet see the day when Graustark regrets

the economy that has cut our little army to almost

nothing. What have we now, all told? Three hundred

men in the Royal Guard. Less than six hundred in the

fortress. I have a hundred policemen. There you are.

To-day there are nearly two hundred soldiers off in the

mountains on nasty business of one sort or another.

'Gad, if these ruffians from the railroad possessed no

more than pistols they could give us a merry fight.

There must be a thousand of them. I don't like it.

We'll have trouble before the day's over."
"General Braze says his regulars can put down any

sort of an uprising in the city," protested Quinnox.

"In case of war, you know we have the twenty thousand

reserves, half of whom were regulars until two years

ago."
"Perfectly true. Quinnox, it's your duty to take care

of the Prince. You've done so in your family for fifteen

generations. See to it that Prince Robin is well looked

after to-day, that's all."
"Trust me for that, Baron," said Quinnox with his

truest smile. Even Marlanx knew that he would have

to kill a Quinnox before a Graustark ruler could be

reached.
By eleven o'clock the streets in the neighbourhood of

the Plaza were packed with people. All along Castle

Avenue, up which the Prince was to drive in the coach

of State, hung the proud, adoring burghers and their

families: like geese to flock, like sheep to scatter. At

twelve the Castle gates were to be thrown open for the

brilliant cavalcade that was to pass between these cheering

rows of people. In less than a quarter of an hour

afterward, the Prince and his court, the noble ladies

and gentlemen of Graustark, with the distinguished

visitors from other lands, would pass into the great

square through Regengetz Circus.
At the corner below the crowded Castle Café, in the

north side of the square, which was now patroled by

brilliant dragoons, two men met and exchanged the

compliments of the day. One of them had just come

up on horseback. He dismounted, leaving the animal in

charge of an urchin who saw a gavvo in sight. This

man was young and rather dashing in appearance. The

other was older and plainly a citizen of some consequence.
"Well?" said the latter impatiently, after they had

passed the time of day for the benefit of the nearest on-lookers.

The younger man, slapping his riding boot

with his crop, led the way to the steps of a house across

the sidewalk. Both had shot a swift, wary glance at

one of the upper windows.
"Everything is ready. There will be no hitch," said

the horseman in low tones.
"You have seen Spantz?"
"Sh! No names. Yes. The girl is ready."
"And the fortress?"
"Fifty men are in the houses opposite and others will

go there—later on."
"We must keep the reserves out of the fortress. It

would mean destruction if they got to the gun-rooms and

the ammunition houses."
"Is he here?" with a motion toward the upper window.
"Yes. He came disguised as an old market woman,

just after daybreak."
"Well, here's his horse," said the other, "but he'll have

to change his dress. It isn't a side saddle." The young

villain laughed silently.
"Go up now to the square, Peter. Your place is

there."
If one had taken the time to observe, he might have

seen that the young man wore his hat well forward, and

that his face was unnaturally white. We, who suspect

him of being Peter Brutus, have reason to believe that

there was an ugly cut on the top of his head and that

it gave him exceeding pain.
Shortly after half past eleven o'clock certain groups

of men usurped the positions in front of certain buildings

on the south side of the square. A score here, a

half score there, others below them. They favoured the

shops operated by the friends of the Committee of

Ten; they were the men who were to take possession of

the rifles that lay hidden behind counters and walls.

Here, there, everywhere, all about the city, other instructed

men were waiting for the signal that was to

tell them to hustle deadly firearms from the beds of

green-laden market wagons. It was all arranged with

deadly precision. There could be no blunder. The

Iron Count and his deputies had seen to that.
Men were stationed in the proper places to cut all telephone

and telegraph wires leading out of the city.

Others were designated to hold the gates against fugitives

who might seek to reach the troops in the hills.
Marlanx's instructions were plain, unmistakable. Only

soldiers and policemen were to be shot; members of the

royal household were already doomed, including the

ministry and the nobles who rode with the royal carriage.
The Committee of Ten had said that there would not

be another ministry, never another Graustark nobility;

only the Party of Equals. The Iron Count had smiled

to himself and let them believe all that they preached

in secret conclave. But he knew that there would be

another ministry, a new nobility and a new ruler, and

that there would be no Committee of Ten!
Two thousand crafty mercenaries, skilled rioters and

fighters from all parts of the world stood ready in the

glad streets of Edelweiss to leap as one man to the

standard of the Iron Count the instant he appeared in

the square after the throwing of the bomb. A well-organised,

carefully instructed army of no mean dimensions,

in the uniform of the lout and vagabond, would

rise like a flash of light before the dazzled, panic-stricken

populace, and Marlanx would be master. Without

the call of drum or bugle his sinister soldiers of

fortune would leap into positions assigned them; in orderly,

determined company front, led by chosen officers,

they would sweep the square, the Circus and the avenues,

up-town to the Castle, down-town to the fortress and

the railway station, everywhere establishing the pennant

of the man who had been banished.
The present dynasty was to end at one o'clock! So

said Marlanx! How could Dangloss or Braze or Quinnox

say him nay? They would be dead or in irons

before the first shock of disaster had ceased to thrill.

The others? Pah! They were as chaff to the Iron

Count.
The calm that precedes the storm fell upon the waiting

throng; an ominous silence spread from one end of the

avenue to the other. For a second only it lasted. The

hush of death could not have been quieter nor more

impressive. Even as people looked at each other in

wonder, the tumult came to its own again. Afterward

a whole populace was to recall this strange, depressing

second of utter stillness; to the end of time that sudden

pall was spoken of with bated breath and in awe.
Then, from the distant Castle came the sound of

shouts, crawling up the long line of spectators for the

full length of the avenue to the eager throng in Regengetz

Circus, swelling and growing louder as the news

came that the Prince had ridden forth from the gates.

Necks were craned, rapt eyes peered down the tree-topped

boulevard, glad voices cried out tidings to those

in the background. The Prince was coming!
Bonny, adorable Prince Robin!
Down the broad avenue came the Royal Military Band,

heading the brilliant procession. Banners were flying;

gold and silver standards gleamed in the van of the

noble cavalcade; brilliantly uniformed cuirassiers and

dragoons on gaily caparisoned horses formed a gilded

phalanx that filled the distant end of the street, slowly

creeping down upon the waiting thousands, drawing

nearer and nearer to the spot of doom.
A stately, noble, inspiring procession it was that swept

toward the Plaza. The love of the people for their

little Prince welled up and overflowed in great waves of

acclamation. Pomp and display, gold and fine raiment

were but the creation of man; Prince Robin was, to them,

the choicest creation of God. He was their Prince!
On came the splendid phalanx of guardsmen, followed

by rigid infantrymen in measured tread; the clattering

of horses' hoofs, the beat of drums, the clanking of

scabbards and the jangling of royal banners, rising

even above the hum of eager voices. The great coach

of gold, with its half score of horses, rolled sombrely beneath

nature's canopy of green, surrounded on all sides

by proud members of the Royal Guard. Word came

down the line that the Prince sat alone in the rear seat of

the great coach, facing the Prime Minister and Countess

Halfont. Two carriages from the royal stables preceded

the Prince's coach. In the first was the Duke of

Perse and three fellow-members of the Cabinet; the

second contained Baron Dangloss and General Braze.

After the Prince came a score or more of rich equipages

filled with the beauty, the nobility, the splendour of this

rich little court.
The curtains in a house at the corner of the square

parted gently. A hawk-faced old man peered out upon

the joyous crowd. His black eyes swept the scene. A

grim smile crept into his face. He dropped the curtains

and walked away from the window, tossing a

cigarette into a grate on the opposite side of the room.

Then he looked at his watch.
All of the bands in the square had ceased playing when

the Castle gates were opened for the royal procession:

only the distant, rythmic beat of a lively march came up

from the avenue to the ears of this baleful old man in

the second-story front room of the home of apothecary

Boltz.
At the extreme outer side of Regengetz Circus a small

group of men and women stood, white-faced and immovable,

steadfastly holding a position in the front

rank of spectators. Shrinking back among this determined

coterie was the slender, shuddering figure of

Olga Platanova, haggard-faced, but with the light of

desperation in her eyes.
As the procession drew nearer, the companions of this

wretched girl slunk away from her side, losing themselves

in the crowd, leaving her to do her work while they

sought distant spots of safety. Olga Platanova, her

arms folded beneath the long red cloak she wore, remained

where they had placed her and—waited!

CHAPTER XVI
THE MERRY VAGABOND
The man who stood in the middle of the freight-car,

looking down in wonder at the fugitives, was a tall

vagabond of the most picturesque type. No ragamuffin

was ever so tattered and torn as this rakish individual.

His clothes barely hung together on his lank frame; he

was barefoot and hatless; a great mop of black hair

topped his shrewd, rugged face; coal-black eyes snapped

and twinkled beneath shaggy brows and a delighted,

knowing grin spread slowly over his rather boyish countenance.

He was not a creature to strike terror to the

heart of any one; on the contrary, his mischievous,

sprightly face produced an impression of genuine good

humour and absolute indifference to the harsh things

of life.
Long, thin lips curled into a smile of delicious regard;

his sides shook with the quiet chuckle of understanding.

He did not lose his smile, even when the match burned

his finger tips and fell to the floor of the car. Instead,

the grin was broader when he struck the second match

and resumed his amused scrutiny of his fellow-lodgers.

This time he practised thrift: he lighted a cigarette

with the match before tossing it aside. Then he softly

slid the car door back in its groove and looked out into

the moist, impenetrable night. A deep sigh left his

smiling lips; a retrospective langour took possession

of his long frame; he sighed again, and still he smiled.
Leaning against the side of the door this genial gypsy

smoked in blissful silence until the stub grew so short

that it burned his already singed fingers. He was thinking

of other days and nights, and of many maids in far-off

lands, and of countless journeys in which he, too,

had had fair and gentle company—short journeys, yes,

but not to be forgotten. Ah, to be knight of the road

and everlasting squire to the Goddess of Love! He

always had been that—ever since he could remember;

he had loved a hundred briefly; none over long. It was

the only way.
Once more he turned to look upon the sleeping pair.

This time he lighted the stub of a tallow candle. The

tender, winning smile in his dark eyes grew to positive

radiance. Ah, how he envied this great, sleeping wayfarer!

How beautiful his mistress! How fortunate the

lover! And how they slept—how tired they were!

Whence had they come? From what distant land had

they travelled together to reach this holiday-garnished

city in the hills? Vagabonds, tramps! They were of

his world, a part of his family; he knew and had loved

a hundred of her sisters, he was one of a hundred-thousand

brothers to this man.
Why should he stay here to spoil their waking hour?

The thought came to him suddenly. No; he would

surrender his apartment to them. He was free and

foot-loose; he could go elsewhere. He would go elsewhere.
Softly he tip-toed to his own corner of the car, looking

over his shoulder with anxious eyes to see that his movements

did not disturb them. He gathered up his belongings:

an ancient violin case, a stout walking stick,

a goodly sized pack done up in gaudy cloth, a well-worn

pair of sandals with long, frayed lacings. As

gently he stole back to the door. Here he sat down,

with his feet hanging outside the car. Then, with many

a sly, wary glance at his good comrades, he put on his

sandals and laced them up the leg. He tossed a kiss to

the sleeping girl, his dark gypsy face aglow with admiration

and mischief, and was about to blow out the

light of his candle. Then he changed his mind. He

arose and stood over them again, looking long and

solemnly at the face of the sleeping girl. Ah, yes, she

was the most beautiful he had ever seen—the very

fairest. He had known her sisters, but-no, they were

not like this one. With a sly grimace of envy he shook

his fist at the tall man whose leg served as a pillow for

the tired head.
The girl looked wan and tired—and hungry. Poor

thing! Never had he seen one so sweet and lovely as

she; never had he seen such a shockingly muddy mackintosh,

however, as the one she wore, never were hands so

dirty as the slender ones which lay limp before her.

With a determined shake of his head and a new flash of

the eye he calmly seated himself and began to open his

ragged pack. Once he paused, a startled look in his

face. He caught sight of the revolver at Truxton's side

for the first time. The instant of alarm passed and a

braver smile than ever came. Ah, here was a knight

who would fight for his lady love! Good fellow! Bravo!
At last his small store of food lay exposed. Without

hesitation he divided the pieces of smoked venison, giving

one part to himself, two to the sleepers; then the

miller's bread and the cheese, and the bag of dates he

had bought the day before. He tied up his own slender

portion and would have whistled for the joy of it all

had he not bethought himself in time.
From one of his pockets he drew out tobacco and

cigarette papers. With his back planted up against

the wall of the car, his legs crossed and his feet wiggling

time to the inward tune he sang, he calmly rolled half

a dozen cigarettes and placed them, one by one, beside

the feast. One match from his thin supply he placed

alongside the cigarettes. Then he looked very doubtful.

No; one might blow out. He must not be niggardly.

So he kept two for himself and gave three to

the guest at his banquet.
Again he blew a kiss to the prettiest girl he had ever

seen. Snuffing his candle, he dropped to the ground and

closed the door against all spying, uncivil eyes.
The first grey of dawn was growing in the sombre east.

He looked out over the tops of cars and sniffed the air.

The rain was over. He knew. A tinge of red that none

but the gypsy could have distinguished betrayed the approach

of a sunny day. Jauntily he swung off down

the path between the lines of cars, his fickle mind wavering

between the joys of the coming day and the memory

of the loveliest Romany he had ever encountered.
Daybreak found him at the wharf gates. It was

gloomy here and silent; the city above looked asleep and

unfruitful. His heart was gay; he longed for company.

Whimsical, careless hearted, he always obeyed the impulse

that struck him first. As he stood there, surveying

the wet, deserted wharf, it came to him suddenly that

if he went back and played one soft love-song before the

door of the car, they might invite him to join them in

the breakfast that the genie had brought.
His long legs were swift. In five minutes he was half

way down the line of cars, at the extreme end of which

stood the happy lodging place of his heart's desire.

Then he paused, a dubious frown between his eyes. No!

he said, slapping his own cheek soundly; it would not

be fair! He would not disturb them, not he! How

could he have thought of such a thing. Le bon Dieu!

Never! He would breakfast alone!
Coming to an empty flat car, direct from the quarries,

he resolutely seated himself upon its edge, and, with

amiable resignation, set about devouring his early meal,

all the while casting longing, almost appealing glances

toward the next car but one. Busy little switch engines

began chugging about the yards; the railroad, at least,

was exhibiting some signs of life. Here and there the

crews were "snaking" out sections and bumping them

off to other parts of the gridiron; a car here, a car there—all

aflounder, but quite simple to this merry wanderer.

He knew all about switching, he did. It did not

cause him the least uneasiness when a sudden jar told

him that an engine had been attached to the distant end

of the string in which he breakfasted. Nor was he

disturbed when the cars began to move. What cared he?

He would ride in his dining-car to the objective switch,

wherever that was, and no doubt would find himself

nearer the main freight depot, with little or no walking

to do on his journey to the square.
But the "string" was not bound for another track in

the yards; it was on its way to the main line, thence off

through the winding valley into strange and distant

lands.
Sir Vagabond, blissfully swinging his heels and munching

his venison, smiled amiably upon the yard men as he

passed them by. So genial was the smile, so frank the

salutation, that not one scowled back at him or hurled

the chunk of coal that bespeaks a surly temper. Down

through the maze of sidetracks whisked the little train,

out upon the main line with a thin shriek of greeting,

past the freight houses—it was then that Sir Vagabond

sat up very straight, a look of mild interest in his

eyes. Interest gave way to perplexity, perplexity to

concern. What's this? Leaving the city? He wasted

no time. This would never do! Clutching his belongings

to his side, he vaulted from one hand, nimbly and

with the gracefulness of wide experience, landing safely

on his feet at the roadside.
There he stood with the wry, dazed look of a man who

suddenly finds himself guilty of arrant stupidity, watching

the cars whiz past on their way to the open country.

Just ahead was the breach in the wall through which all

trains entered or left the city. Into that breach shot

the train, going faster and faster as it saw the straight,

clear track beyond. He waited until the tail end

whisked itself out of sight in the cut below the city walls,

and then trudged slowly, dejectedly in the opposite direction,

his heart in his boots. He was thinking of the

luckless pair in the empty "box."
Suddenly he stopped, his chin up, his hands to his

sides. A hearty peal of laughter soared from his lips.

He was regarding the funny side of the situation. The

joke was on them! It was rich! The more he thought

of their astonishment on awaking, the more he laughed.

He leaned against a car.
His immense levity attracted attention. Four or five

men approached him from the shadows of the freight

houses, ugly, unsmiling fellows. They demanded of him

the cause of his unseemly mirth. With tears in his

merry black eyes he related the plight of the pretty

slumberers, dwelling more or less sentimentally on the

tender beauty of the maiden fair. They plied him with

questions. He described the couple—even glowingly.

Then the sinister fellows smiled; more than that, they

clapped each other on the back and swore splendidly.

He was amazed and his own good humour gave way to

fierce resentment. What right had these ruffians to

laugh at the misfortunes of that unhappy maid?
A switchman came up, and one of the men, a lank

American whom we should recognise by the sound of

his voice (having heard it before), asked whither the

train was bound and when it would first stop in its

flight.
"At the Poo quarries, seventeen kilometers down the

line. They cut out a few empties there. She goes on

to the division point after that."
"Any trains up from that direction this morning?"

demanded "Newport."
"Not till this afternoon. Most of the crews are in the

city for the—" But the switchman had no listeners

beyond that statement.
And so it was that the news spread over town at five

o'clock that Truxton King was where he could do no

harm. It was well known that the train would make

forty miles an hour down the steep grade into the lower

valley.
Up into the city strolled Sir Vagabond, his fiddle in

his hand, his heart again as light as a feather. Some

day—ah, some day! he would see her again on the road.

It was always the way. Then he would tell her how

unhappy he had been—for a minute. She was so pretty,

so very pretty! He sighed profoundly. We see no

more of him.
When Truxton King first awoke to the fact that they

were no longer lying motionless in the dreary yards,

he leaped to his feet with a startled shout of alarm.

Loraine sat up, blinking her eyes in half-conscious wonder.

It was broad daylight, of course; the train was

rattling through the long cut just below the city walls.

With frantic energy he pulled open the door. For a

minute he stared at the scudding walls of stone so close

at hand, uncomprehendingly. Then the truth burst

upon him with the force of a mighty blow. He staggered

back, his jaw dropping, his eyes glaring.
"What the dev—Great God, Loraine! We're going!

We're moving!" he cried hoarsely.
"I know it," she gasped, her body rocking violently

with the swaying of the wild, top-heavy little car.
"Great Scott! How we're pounding it! Fifty miles

an hour. Where are we?" he cried, aghast. He could

scarcely keep his feet, so terrific was the speed and so

sickening the motion.
She got to her feet and lurched to his side. "Don't fall

out!" she almost shrieked. He drew back with her. Together

they swayed like reeds in a windstorm, staring

dizzily at the wall before them.
Suddenly the train shot out into the open, farm-spattered valley.

Truxton fell back dumbfounded.
"The country!" he exclaimed. "We've been carried

away. I—I can't believe my senses. Could we have

slept—what a fool, what an idiot! God in heaven! The

Prince! He is lost!" He was beside himself with

anguish and despair, raging like a madman, cursing

himself for a fool, a dog, a murderer!
Little less distressed than her companion, Loraine Tullis

still had the good sense to keep him from leaping from

the car. He had shouted to her that he must get back to

the city; she could go on to the next town and find a

hiding place. He would come to her as soon as he had

given the alarm.
"You would be killed," she cried, clutching his arm

fiercely. "You never can jump, Truxton. See how we

are running. If you jump, I shall follow. I won't go

on alone. I am as much to blame as you."
The big, strong fellow broke down and cried, utterly

disheartened.
"Don't cry, Truxton, please don't cry!" she pleaded.

"Something will happen. We must stop sometime.

Then we can get another train back, or telegraph, or

hire a wagon. It must be very early. The sun is

scarcely up. Do be brave! Don't give up!"
He squared his shoulders. "You put me to shame!" he

cried abjectly. "I'm—I'm unnerved, that's all. It was

too much of a blow. After we'd got away from those

scoundrels so neatly, too. Oh, it's maddening! I'll be

all right in a minute. You plucky, plucky darling!"
The train whirled through a small hamlet without even

slackening its speed. Truxton endeavoured to shout a

warning to two men who stood by the gates; but they

merely laughed, not comprehending. Then he undertook

to arrest the attention of the engineer. He leaned

from the door and shouted. The effort was futile, almost

disastrous. A lurch came near to hurling him to

the rocky road bed. Now and then they passed farmers

on the high road far above, bound for the city. They

called out to them, but the cries were in vain. With every

minute they were running farther and farther away

from the city of Edelweiss; every mile was adding to the

certainty of the doom which hung over the little Prince

and his people.
A second small station flew by. "Ronn: seven kilometers

to Edelweiss." He looked at her in despair.
"We're going faster and faster," he grated. "This is

the fastest train in the world, Loraine, bar none."
Just then his gaze alighted on the pathetic breakfast

and the wandering cigarettes. He stared as if hypnotised.

Was he going mad? An instant later he was on

his hands and knees, examining the mysterious feast.

She joined him at once; no two faces ever before were

so puzzled and perplexed.
"By heaven!" he exclaimed, drawing her away from

the spot in quick alarm, comprehension flooding his

brain. "I see it all! We've been deliberately shanghaied!

We've been bottled up here, drugged, perhaps,

and shipped out of town by fast freight—no destination.

Don't touch that stuff! It's probably full of poison.

Great Scott! What a clever gang they are! And what

a blithering idiot they have in me to deal with. Oh,

how easy!"
Whereupon he proceeded to kick the unoffending

breakfast, cigarettes and all, out of the car door. To

their dying day they were to believe that the food had

been put there by agents of the great conspirator. It

readily may be surmised that neither of them was given

to sensible deductions during their astounding flight.

If they had thought twice, they might have seen the

folly of their quick conclusions. Marlanx's men would

not have sent Loraine off in a manner like this. But the

distracted pair were not in an analytical frame of mind

just then; that is why the gentle munificence of Sir

Vagabond came to a barren waste.
Mile after mile flew by. The unwilling travellers, depressed

beyond description, had given up all hope of

leaving the car until it reached the point intended by

the wily plotters. To their amazement, however, the

speed began to slacken perceptibly after they had left

the city ten or twelve miles behind. Truxton was leaning

against the side of the door, gloomily surveying the

bright, green landscape. For some time Loraine had

been steadying herself by clinging to his arm. They had

cast off the unsightly rain coats and other clumsy articles.

Once, through sheer inability to control his impulses,

he had placed his arm about her slim waist, but

she had gently freed herself. Her look of reproach

was sufficient to check all future impulses of a like

nature.
"Hello!" said he, coming out of his bitter dream.
"We're slowing up." He looked out and ahead. "No

station is in sight. There's a bridge down the road a

bit—yes, there's our same old river. By George!" His

face was a study.
"What is it?" she cried, struck by his sudden energy

of speech.
"They're running slow for the bridge. Afraid of the

floods. D'ye see? If they creep up to it as they do

in the United States when they're cautious, we'll politely

drop off and—'Pon my soul, she's coming down to a

snail's pace. We can swing off, Loraine. Now's our

chance!"
The train was barely creeping up to the bridge. He

clasped her in the strong crook of his left arm, slid

down to a sitting position, and boldly pushed himself

clear of the car, landing on his feet. Staggering forward

with the impetus he had received, he would have

fallen except for a mighty effort. A sharp groan

escaped his lips as he lowered her to the ground. She

looked anxiously into his face and saw nothing there

but relief.
The cars rumbled across the bridge, picked up speed

beyond, and thundered off in the distance with never so

much as a thought of the two who stood beside the

track and laughed hysterically.
"Come along," said the man briefly. "We must try

to reach that station back there. There I can telegraph

in. Oh!" His first attempt to walk brought out a

groan of pain.
He had turned his ankle in the leap to the ground. She

was deeply concerned, but he sought to laugh it off.

Gritting his teeth determinedly, he led the way back

along the track.
"Lean on me," she cried despairingly.
"Nonsense," he said with grim stubbornness. "I don't

mind the pain. We can't stop for a sprained ankle.

It's an old one I got playing football. We may have to

go a little slow, but we'll not stop, my dear—not till

we get word to Dangloss!"
She found a long, heavy stick for him; thereafter he

hobbled with greater speed and less pain. At a wagon-road

crossing they paused to rest, having covered two

miles. The strain was telling on him; perspiration stood

out in great drops upon his brow; he was beginning to

despair. Her little cry of joy caused him to look up

from the swollen ankle which he was regarding with

dubious concern. An oxcart was approaching from the

west.
"A ride!" she cried joyously. She had been ready to

drop with fatigue; her knees were shaking. His first

exclamation of joy died away in a groan of dismay. He

laughed bitterly.
"That thing couldn't get us anywhere in a week," he

said.
"But it will help," she cried brightly, an optimist by

force of necessity.
They stopped the cart and bargained for a ride to

Ronn. The man was a farmer, slow and suspicious.

He haggled.
"The country's full of evil men and women these days,"

he demurred. "Besides I have a heavy enough load as

it is for my poor beasts."
Miss Tullis conducted the negotiations, making the

best of her year's acquaintance with the language of the

country.
"Don't tell him why we are in such a hurry," cautioned

King. "He may be a Marlanx sympathiser."
"You have nothing in your cart but melons," she said

to the farmer, peeping under the corner of the canvas

covering.
"I am not going through Ronn, but by the high road

to Edelweiss," he protested. "A good ten kilometers."
"But carry us until we come up with some one who can

give us horses."
"Horses!" he croaked. "Every horse in the valley is

in Edelweiss by this time. This is the great day there.

The statue of—"
"Yes, yes, I know. We are bound for Edelweiss. Can

you get us there in two hours?"
"With these beasts, poor things? Never!"
"It will be worth your while. A hundred gavvos if

you carry us to a place where we can secure quicker

transportation."
In time she won him over. He agreed to carry them

along the way, at his best speed, until they came up with

better beasts or reached the city gates. It was the best

he could do. The country was practically deserted on

this day. At best there were but few horses in the

valley; mostly oxen. They climbed up to the seat and

the tortuous journey began. The farmer trotted beside

the wheel nearly all of the way, descanting warmly

in painful English on the present condition of things in

the hills.
"The rascals have made way with the beautiful Miss

Tullis. She is the American lady stopping at the

Castle. You should see her, sir. Excepting our dear

Princess Yetive—God rest her soul—she is the most

beautiful creature Graustark has ever seen. I have seen

her often. Not quite so grand as the Countess Ingomede,

but fairer, believe me. She is beloved by everyone.

Many a kind and generous word has she spoken to me.

My onion beds are well known to her. She has come to

my farm time and again, sir, with the noble personages,

while riding, and she has in secret bought my little slips

of onions. She has said to me that she adores them,

but that she can only eat them in secret. Ah, sir, it

is a sad day for Graustark that evil has happened to her.

Her brother, they say, is off in the Dawsbergen hills

searching for her. He is a grand man."
His passengers were duly interested. She nudged the

lugubrious Truxton when the man spoke of the onions.

"What a fibber! I hate onions."
"She is to be married to the Count Vos Engo; a fine

lad, sir. Now she is gone, I don't know what he will

do. Suicide, mayhap. Many is the time I have cautioned

her not to ride in the hills without a strong

guard. These bandits are getting very bold."
"Do you know the great Count Marlanx?" demanded

King, possessed of a sudden thought. The man faced

him at the mention of the name, a suspicious gleam in

his eyes.
"Count Marlanx!" he snorted. Without another word,

he drew the beasts to a standstill. There was no mistaking

the angry scowl. "Are you friends of that

snake? If you are, get out of my cart."
"He's all right," cried Truxton. "Tell him who we

are, Loraine, and why we must get to the city."
Five minutes later, the farmer, overcome by the stupendous

news, was lashing his oxen with might and main;

the astonished beasts tore down the road to Ronn so

bravely that there seemed some prospect of getting a

telegram through in time. All the way the excited

countryman groaned and swore and sputtered his prayers.

At Ronn they learned that the operator had been

unable to call Edelweiss since seven o'clock. The wires

were down or had been cut. Truxton left a message

to be sent to Dangloss in case he could get the wire, and

off they started again for the city gates, having lost

considerable time by the diverted mile or two.
Not man, woman or child did they encounter as the

miles crept by. The country was barren of humanity.

Ahead of them was the ascent to be conquered by oxen

so old and feeble that the prospect was more than

dubious.
"If it should be that my team gives out, I will run on

myself to give the alarm," cried the worthy, perspiring

charioteer. "It shall not be! God preserve us!"
Three times the oxen broke down, panting and stubborn;

as many times he thwacked them and kicked them

and cursed them into action again. They stumbled

pitifully, but they did manage to go forward.
In time the city gates came in sight—far up the

straight, narrow road. "Pray God we may not be too

late," groaned the farmer. "Damn the swine who took

their horses to town before the sun was up. Curse

them for fools and imbeciles. Fools never get into

heaven. Thank the good Lord for that."
It seemed to the quivering Americans that the gates

were mocking them by drawing farther away instead of

coming nearer.
"Are we going backward?" groaned Truxton, his

hands gripping the side of the bounding seat.
Near the gates, which were still open, it occurred to

him in a single flash of dismay that he and Loraine

would be recognised and intercepted by Marlanx watchers.

Between the fierce jolts of the great cart he

managed to convey his fears to her.
It was she who had the solution. They might succeed

in passing the gates if they hid themselves in the bed of

the cart, underneath the thick canvas covering. The

farmer lifted the cloth and they crawled down among

the melons. In this fashion they not only covered the

remainder of the distance, half stifled by the heat and

half murdered by the uncomfortable position, but passed

through the gates and were taken clattering down the

streets toward the centre of town.
"To the Tower!" cried the anxious Truxton.
"Impossible!" shouted the farmer. "The streets are

roped off and the crowds are too great."
"Then let us out as near to the Tower as possible,

cried the other.
"Here we are," cried the driver, a few minutes later,

pulling up his half dead oxen and leaping to the ground.

He threw off the covering and they lost no time in tumbling

from their bed of melons to the cobble-stone pavement

of a narrow alley into which he had turned for

safety. "Through this passage!" he gasped, hoarse

with excitement. "The Tower is below. Follow me!

My oxen will stand. I am going with you!" His

rugged face was aglow.
Off through the alley they hurried, King disdaining

the pain his ankle was giving him. They came to the

crowded square a few minutes later. The clock in the

Cathedral pointed to twelve o'clock and after! The

catastrophe had not yet taken place; the people were

laughing and singing and shouting. They were in time.

Everywhere they heard glad voices crying out that the

Prince was coming! It was the Royal band that they

heard through dinning ears!
"Great God!" cried Truxton, stopping suddenly and

pointing with trembling hand to a spot across the street

and a little below where they had pushed through the

resentful, staring throng on the sidewalk. "There she

is! At the corner! Stop her!"
He had caught sight of Olga Platanova.
The first row of dragoons was already passing in front

of her. Less than two hundred feet away rolled the

royal coach of gold! All this flashed before the eyes of

the distracted pair, who were now dashing frantically

into the open street, disregarding the shouts of the

police and the howls of the crowd.
"An anarchist!" shouted King hoarsely. He looked

like one himself. "The bomb! The bomb! Stop the

Prince!"
Colonel Quinnox recognised this bearded, uncouth

figure, and the flying, terrified girl at his heels. King

was dragging her along by the hand. There was an

instant of confusion on the part of the vanguard, a

drawing of sabres, a movement toward the coach in

which the Prince rode.
Quinnox alone prevented the dragoons from cutting

down the pallid madman who stumbled blindly toward

the coaches beyond. He whirled his steed after an

astonished glance in all directions, shouting eager commands

all the while. When he reached the side of the

gasping American, that person had stopped and was

pointing toward the trembling Olga, who had seen and

recognised him.
"Stop the coach!" cried King. Loraine was running

frantically through the ranks of horsemen, screaming

her words of alarm.
The Duke of Perse leaped from his carriage and ran

forward, shouting to the soldiers to seize the disturbers.

Panic seized the crowd. There was a mad rush for the

corner above. Olga Platanova stood alone, her eyes

wide and glassy, staring as if petrified at the face of

Truxton King.
He saw the object in her wavering hand. With a

yell he dashed for safety down the seething avenue. The

Duke of Perse struck at him as he passed, ignoring the

frantic cry of warning that he uttered. A plain, white-faced

farmer in a smock of blue was crossing the street

with mighty bounds, his eyes glued upon the arm of the

frail, terrified anarchist. If he could only arrest that

palsied, uncertain arm!
But she hurled the bomb, her hands going to her eyes

as she fell upon her knees.

CHAPTER XVII.
THE THROWING OF THE BOMB
The scene that followed beggars all powers of description.
A score of men and horses lay writhing in the street;

others crept away screaming with pain; human flesh and

that of animals lay in the path of the frenzied, panic-stricken

holiday crowd; blood mingled with the soft mud

of Regengetz Circus, slimy, slippery, ugly!
Rent bodies of men in once gaudy uniforms, now

flattened and bruised in warm, oozy death, were piled in

a mass where but a moment before the wondering vanguard

of troopers had clustered. For many rods in all

directions stunned creatures were struggling to their

feet after the stupendous shock that had felled them.

The clattering of frightened horses, the shouts and

screams of men and women, the gruesome rush of ten

thousand people in stampede—all in twenty seconds after

the engine of death left the hand of Olga Platanova.
Olga Platanova! There was nothing left of her! She

had failed to do the deed expected of her, but she would

not hear the execrations of those who had depended upon

her to kill the Prince. We draw a veil across the picture

of Olga Platanova after the bomb left her hand;

no one may look upon the quivering, shattered thing

that once was a living, beautiful woman. The glimpse

she had of Truxton King's haggard face unnerved her.

She faltered, her strength of will collapsed; she hurled

the bomb in a panic of indecision. Massacre but not

conquest!
Down in an alley below the Tower, a trembling, worn

team of oxen stood for a day and night, awaiting the

return of a master who was never to come back to them.

God rest his simple soul!
Truxton King picked himself up from the street,

dazed, bewildered but unhurt. Everywhere about him

mad people were rushing and screeching. Scarcely

knowing what he did, he fled with the crowd. From behind

him came the banging of guns, followed by new

shouts of terror. He knew what it meant! The revolutionists

had begun the assault on the paralysed

minions of the government.
Scores of Royal Guardsmen swept past him, rushing

to the support of the coach of gold. The sharp, shrill

scream of a single name rose above the tumult. Some

one had seen the Iron Count!
"Marlanx!"
He looked back toward the gory entrance to the Circus.

There was Marlanx, mounted and swinging a sabre on

high. Ahead was the mass of carriages, filled with the

white-faced, palsied prey from the Court of Graustark.

Somewhere in that huddled, glittering crowd were two

beings he willingly would give his own life to save.
Foot soldiers, policemen and mounted guardsmen began

firing into the crowd at the square, without sense or

discretion, falling back, nevertheless, before the well-timed,

deliberate advance of the mercenaries. From

somewhere near the spot where Olga Platanova fell came

a harsh, penetrating command:
"Cut them off! Cut them off from the Castle!"
It was his cue. He dashed into the street and ran toward

the carriages, shouting with all his strength:
"Turn back! It is Marlanx! To the Castle!"
Then it was that he saw the Prince. The boy was

standing on a seat on the royal coach of state, holding

out his eager little hands to some one in the thick of the

crowd that surged about him. He was calling some

one's name, but no one could have heard him.
Truxton's straining eyes caught sight of the figure in

grey that struggled forward in response to the cries

and the extended hands. He pushed his way savagely

through the crowd; he came up with her as she reached

the side of the coach, and with a shout of encouragement

grasped her in his arms.
"Aunt Loraine! Aunt Loraine!" He now heard the

name the boy cried with all his little heart.
Two officers struck at the uncouth, desperate American

as he lifted the girl from the ground and deliberately

tossed her into the coach.
"Turn back!" he shouted. A horseman rode him down.

He looked up as the plunging animal's hoofs clattered

about his head. Vos Engo, with drawn sword, was

crowding up to the carriage door, shouting words of

rejoicing at sight of the girl he loved.
Somehow he managed to crawl from under the hoofs

and wheels, not without thumps and bruises, and made

his way to the sidewalk. The coach had swung around

and the horses were being lashed into a gallop for the

Castle gates.
He caught a glimpse of her, holding the Prince in her

arms, her white, agonised face turned toward the mob.

Distinctly he heard her cry:
"Save him! Save Truxton King!"
From the sidewalks swarmed well-armed hordes of

desperadoes, firing wildly into the ranks of devoted

guardsmen grouped in the avenue to cover the flight of

their royal charge. Truxton fled from the danger zone

as fast as his legs would carry him. Bullets were striking

all about him. Later on he was to remember his

swollen, bitterly painful ankle; but there was no thought

of it now. He had played football with this same ankle

in worse condition than it was now—and he had played

for the fun of it, too.
He realised that his life was worth absolutely nothing

if he fell into the hands of the enemy. His only chance

lay in falling in with some sane, loyal citizen who could

be prevailed upon to hide him until the worst was over.

There seemed no possibility of getting inside the Castle

grounds. He had done his duty and—he laughed

bitterly as he thought of it—he had been ridden down

by the men he came to save.
Some one was shouting his name behind in the scurrying

crowd. He turned for a single glance backward.

Little Mr. Hobbs, pale as a ghost, his cap gone, his

clothing torn, was panting at his elbow.
"God save us!" gasped Hobbs. "Are you alive or am

I seeing all the bloody ghosts in the world?"
"I'm alive all right," cried King. "Where can we go?

Be quick, Hobbs! Think! Don't sputter like that. I

want to be personally conducted, and damned quick at

that."
"Before God, sir, I 'aven't the idea where to go,"

groaned Hobbs. "It's dreadful! Did you see what the

woman did back there—"
"Don't stop to tell me about it, Hobbs. Keep on running.

Go ahead of me. I'm used to following the man

from Cook's."
"Right you are, sir. I say, by Jove, I'm glad to see

you—I am. You came right up out of the ground as

if—"
"Is there no way to get off this beastly avenue?"

panted King. "They're shooting back there like a pack

of wild men. I hate to think of what's going on."
"Dangloss will 'ave them all in the jug inside of ten

minutes, take my word—"
"They'll have Dangloss hanging from a telephone;

pole, Hobbs! Don't talk! Run!"
Soldiers came riding up from behind, turning to fire

from their saddles into the throng of cutthroats, led

by the grim old man with the bloody sabre. In the

centre of the troop there was a flying carriage. The

Duke of Perse was lying back in the seat, his face like

that of a dead man. Far ahead rattled the royal coach

and the wildly flying carriages of state.
"The Prince is safe!" shouted King joyously. "They'll

make it! Thank God!"
Colonel Quinnox turned in his saddle and searched out

the owner of that stirring voice.
"Come!" he called, drawing rein as soon as he caught

sight of him.
Even as King rushed out into the roadway a horseman

galloped up from the direction of the Castle. He pulled

his horse to his haunches almost as he was riding over the

dodging American.
"Here!" shouted the newcomer, scowling down upon

the young man. "Swing up here! Quick, you fool!"
It was Vos Engo, his face black with fury. Quinnox

had seized the hand of Mr. Hobbs on seeing help for

King and was pulling him up before him. There was

nothing for Truxton to do but to accept the timely

help of his rival. An instant later he was up behind him

and they were off after the last of the dragoons.
"If you don't mind, Count, I'll try my luck," grated

the American. Holding on with one arm, he turned and

fired repeatedly in the direction of the howling crowd

of rascals.
"Ride to the barracks gates, Vos Engo!" commanded

Colonel Quinnox. "Be prepared to admit none but the

Royal Reserves, who are under standing orders to report

there in time of need."
"God grant that they may be able to come," responded

the Count. Over his shoulder he hissed to his companion.

"It was not idle heroics, my friend, nor philanthropy

on my part. I was commanded to come and fetch

you. She would never have spoken to me again if I had

refused."
"She? Ah, yes; I see. Good! She did not forget

me!" cried Truxton, his heart bounding.
"My own happiness depends on my luck in getting you

to safety," rasped the Count. "My life's happiness.

Understand, damn you, it is not for you that I risk my

life."
"I understand," murmured Truxton, a wry smile on

his pale lips. "You mean, she is going to pay you in

some way for picking me up, eh? Well, I'll put an

end to that. I'll drop off again. Then you can ride on

and tell her—I wouldn't be a party to the game. Do you

catch my meaning?"
"You would, eh?" said the Count angrily. "I'd like

to see you drop off while we're going at this—"
"I've got my pistol in the middle of your back," grated

Truxton. "Slow up a bit or I'll scatter your vertebræ

all over your system. Pull up!"
"As you like," cried Vos Engo. "I've done my part.

Colonel Quinnox will bear witness." He began pulling

his horse down. "Now, you are quite free to drop off."
Without a word the American swung his leg over and

slid to the ground. "Thanks for the lift you've given

me," he called up to the astonished officer.
"Don't thank me," sang out his would-be saviour as

he put spur to his horse.
It is a lamentable thing to say, but Truxton King's

extraordinary sacrifice was not altogether the outgrowth

of heroism. We have not been called upon at

any time to question his courage; we have, on the other

hand, seen times when he displayed the most arrant foolhardiness.

I defy any one to prove, however, that he

ever neglected an opportunity to better himself by

strategy at the expense of fortitude. Therefore, it is

not surprising that even at such a time as this we may

be called upon to record an example of his spectacular

cunning.
Be sure of it, he did not decide to slide from Vos Engo's

horse until he saw a way clear to better his position,

and at the same time to lessen the glory of his unpleasant

rescuer.
Less than a hundred yards behind loped a riderless

horse; the dragoon who had sat the saddle was lying

far back in the avenue, a bullet in his head. Hobbling

to the middle of the road, the American threw up his

hands and shouted briskly to the bewildered animal.

Throwing his ears forward in considerable doubt, the

horse came to a standstill close at hand. Five seconds

later King was in the saddle and tearing along in the

wake of the retreating guard, his hair blowing from

his forehead, his blood leaping with the joy of achievement.
Mr. Hobbs afterward informed him that Count Vos

Engo's oaths were worth going miles to avoid.
"We need such men as King!" cried Colonel Quinnox

as he waited inside the gates for the wild rider. A moment

later King dashed through and the massive bolts

were shot.
As he pulled up in front of the steward's lodge to

await the orders of the Colonel, the exultant American

completed the soliloquy that began with the mad impulse

to ride into port under his own sails.
"I'll have to tell her that he did a fine thing in coming

back for me, much as he hated to do it. What's more,

I shan't say a word about his beastly temper. We'll let

it pass. He deserves a whole lot for the part he played.

I'll not forget it. Too bad he had to spoil it all by talking

as he did. But, hang me, if he shall exact anything

from her because he did a thing he didn't want to do.

I took a darned sight bigger chance than he did, after

all. Good Lord, what a mess I would have been in if

the nag hadn't stopped! Whew! Well, old boy, you

did stop, God bless you. Colonel," he spoke, as Quinnox

came up, "do you think I can buy this horse? He's

got more sense than I have."
Small bodies of foot soldiers and policemen fighting

valiantly against great odds were admitted to the

grounds during the next half hour. Scores had been

killed by the fierce, irregular attack of the revolutionists;

others had become separated from their comrades

and were even now being hunted down and destroyed

by the infuriated followers of Marlanx. A hundred

or more of the reserves reached the upper gates

before it occurred to the enemy to blockade the streets

in that neighbourhood. General Braze, with a few of his

men, bloody and heartsick, was the last of the little

army to reach safety in the Castle grounds, coming up

by way of the lower gates from the fortress, which they

had tried to reach after the first outbreak, but had found

themselves forestalled.
The fortress, with all guns, stores and ammunition, was

in the hands of the Iron Count and his cohorts.
Baron Dangloss had been taken prisoner with a whole

platoon of fighting constables. This was the last appalling

bit of news to reach the horrified, disorganised

forces in the Castle grounds.
Citizens had fled to their homes, unmolested. The

streets were empty, save for the armed minions of the

Iron Count. They rushed hither and thither in violent

detachments, seeking out the men in uniform, yelling

and shooting like unmanageable savages.
Before two o'clock the city itself was in the hands of

the hated enemy of the Crown. He and his aliens, malefactors

and all, were in complete control of the fortress,

the gates and approaches, the Tower and the bloody

streets. A thousand of them,—eager, yelling ruffians,—marched

to within firing distance of the Castle walls and

held every approach against reinforcements. Except

for the failure to destroy the Prince and his counsellors,

the daring, unspeakable plans of Count Marlanx had

been attended by the most horrifying results. He was

master. There was no question as to that. The few

hundred souls in the Castle grounds were like rats in a

trap.
A wise as well as a cruel man was Marlanx. He lost

no time in issuing a manifesto to the stunned, demoralised

citizens of Edelweiss. Scores of criers went

through the streets during the long, wretched afternoon,

announcing to the populace that Count Marlanx had

established himself as dictator and military governor of

the principality—pending the abdication of the Prince

and the beginning of a new and substantial regime. All

citizens were commanded to recognise the authority of

the dictator; none except those who disobeyed or resented

this authority would be molested. Traffic would

be resumed on the following Monday. Tradespeople

and artisans were commanded to resume their occupations

under penalty of extreme punishment in case of

refusal. These and many other edicts were issued from

Marlanx's temporary headquarters in the Plaza—almost

at the foot of the still veiled monument of the beloved

Princess Yetive.
Toward evening, after many consultations and countless

reports, Marlanx removed his headquarters to the

Tower. He had fondly hoped to be in the Castle long

before this. His rage and disappointment over the

stupid miscarriage of plans left no room for conjecture

as to the actual state of his feelings. For hours he had

raved like a madman. Every soldier who fell into his

hands was shot down like a dog.
The cells and dungeons in the great old tower were

now occupied by bruised, defeated officers of the law.

Baron Jasto Dangloss, crushed in spirit and broken of

body, paced the blackest and narrowest cell of them all.

The gall and wormwood that filled his soul was not to

be measured by words. He blamed himself for the catastrophe;

it was he who had permitted this appalling

thing to grow and burst with such sickening results. In

his mind there was no doubt that Marlanx had completely

overthrown the dynasty and was in full possession

of the government. He did not know that the

Prince and his court had succeeded in reaching the

Castle, whose walls and gates were well-nigh impregnable

to assault, even by a great army. If he had

known this he might have rejoiced!
Late in the evening he received a visit from Marlanx,

the new master.
The Iron Count, lighted by a ghostly lantern in the

hands of a man who, ten hours before, had been a

prisoner within these very walls, came up to the narrow

grating that served as a door and gazed complacently

upon the once great minister of police.
"Well," said Dangloss, his eyes snapping, "what is it,

damn you?"
Marlanx stroked his chin and smiled. "I believe this

is my old confrère, Baron Dangloss," he remarked.

"Dear me, I took you, sir, to be quite impeccable. Here

you are, behind the bars. Will wonders never cease?"
Dangloss merely glared at him.
The Iron Count went on suavely: "You heard me,

Baron. Still, I do not require an answer. How do you

like your new quarters? It may please you to know that

I am occupying your office, and also that noble suite

overlooking the Plaza. I find myself most agreeably

situated. By the way, Baron, I seem to recall something

to mind as I look at you. You were the kindly

disposed gentleman who escorted me to the city gates a

few years ago and there turned me over to a detachment

of soldiers, who, in turn, conveyed me to the border. If

I recall the occasion rightly, you virtually kicked me

out of the city. Am I right?"
"You are!" was all that the bitter Dangloss said, without

taking his fierce gaze from the sallow face beyond

the bars.
"I am happy to find that my memory is so good," said

Marlanx.
"I expect to be able to repeat the operation," said

Dangloss.
"How interesting! You forget that history never repeats

itself."
"See here, Marlanx, what is your game? Speak up;

I'm not afraid of you. Do you intend to take me out

and shoot me at sunrise?"
"Oh, dear me, no! That would be a silly proceeding.

You own vast estates in Graustark, if I mistake not, just

as I did eight or nine years ago. Well, I have come

into my own again. The Crown relieved me of my

estates, my citizenship, my honour. I have waited long

to regain them. Understand me, Dangloss; I am in

control now; my word is law. I do not intend to kill

you. It is my intention to escort you to the border and

kick you out of Graustark. See for yourself how it

feels. Everything you possess is to be taken away from

you. You will be a wanderer on the face of the earth—a

pauper. All you have is here. Therein lies the

distinction: I had large possessions in other lands. I

had friends and a following, as you see. You will have

none of these, Baron."
"A splendid triumph, you beast!"
"Of course, you'd much prefer being shot."
"Not at all. Banish me, if you please; strip me of all

I possess. But I'll come back another day, Count

Marlanx."
"Ah, yes; that reminds me. I had quite forgotten to

say that the first ten years of your exile are to be spent

in the dungeons at Schloss Marlanx. How careless of

me to have neglected to state that in the beginning. In

ten years you will be seventy-five, Baron. An excellent

time of life for one to begin his wanderings over the

world which will not care to remember him."
"Do you expect me to get down on my knees and plead

for mercy, you scoundrel?"
"I know you too well for that, my dear Baron."
"Get out of my sight!"
"Pray do not forget that I am governor of the Tower

at present. I go and come as I choose."
"God will punish you for what you have done. There's

solace in that."
"As you like, Baron. If it makes it easier for you to

feel that God will take a hand in my humble affairs, all

well and good. I grant you that delectable privilege."
Baron Dangloss turned his back upon his smiling

enemy, his body quivering with passion.
"By the way, Baron, would you care to hear all the

latest news from the seat of war? It may interest you

to know that the Castle is besieged in most proper

fashion. No one—"
"The Castle besieged? Then, by the Eternal, you did

not take the Prince!"
"Not at all! He is in the Castle for a few hours of

imaginary safety. To-night my men will be admitted

to the grounds by friends who have served two masters

for a twelve-month or longer."
"Traitors in the Castle?" cried Dangloss in horror.

He was now facing the Count.
"Hardly that, my dear sir. Agents, I should call them.

Isn't it splendid?"
"You are a—"
"Don't say it, Baron. Save your breath. I know what

you would call me, and can save you the trouble of

shouting it, as you seem inclined to do."
"Thank God, your assassins not only failed to

dynamite the boy, but your dogs failed to capture him.

By heaven, God is with Prince Robin, after all!"
"How exalted you seem, Baron! It is a treat to look

at you. Oh, another thing: the Platanova girl was not

my assassin."
"That's a lie!"
"You shall not chide me in that fashion, Baron. You

are very rude. No; the girl was operating for what I

have since discovered to be the Committee of Ten, leading

the Party of Equals in Graustark. To-morrow

morning I shall have the Committee of Ten seized and

shot in the public square. We cannot harbour dynamiters

and assassins of that type. There are two-score

or more of anarchist sympathisers here. We will cheerfully

shoot all of them—an act that you should have

performed many days ago, my astute friend. It might

have saved trouble. They are a dangerous element in

any town. Those whom I do not kill I shall transport

to the United States in exchange for the Americans who

have managed to lose themselves over here. A fair exchange,

you see. Moreover, I hear that the United

States Government welcomes the Reds if they are white

instead of yellow. Clever, but involved, eh? Well,

good night, Baron. Sleep well. I expect to see you

again after the rush of business attending the adjustment

of my own particular affairs. In a day or two I

shall move into the Castle. You may be relieved to

know that I do not expect to find the time to kick you

out of Graustark under a week or ten days."
"My men: what of them? The brave fellows who were

taken with me? You will not deprive—"
"In time they will be given the choice of serving me as

policemen or serving the world as examples of folly.

Rest easy concerning them. Ah, yes, again I have

stupidly forgotten something. Your excellent friend,

Tullis, will not re-enter Edelweiss alive. That is quite

assured, sir. So you see, he will, after all, be better off

than you. I don't blame him for loving my wife. It

was my desire to amicably trade my wife off to him for

his charming sister, but the deal hangs fire. What a

scowl! I dare say you contemplate saying something

bitter, so I'll retire. A little later on I shall be

chatting with the Prince at the Castle. I'll give him

your gentlest felicitations."
But Marlanx was doomed to another disappointment

before the night was over. The Castle gates were not

opened to his forces. Colonel Quinnox apprehended the

traitors in time to prevent the calamity. Ten hostlers

in the Royal stables were taken redhanded in the attempt

to overpower the small guard at the western gates.

Their object was made plain by the subsequent futile

movement of a large force of men at that particular

point.
Prince Robin was safe for the night.

CHAPTER XVIII
TRUXTON ON PARADE
Count Marlanx was a soldier. He knew how to take

defeat and to bide his time; he knew how to behave in

the hour of victory and in the moment of rout. The

miscarriage of a detail here and there in this vast, comprehensive

plan of action did not in the least sense

discourage him. It was no light blow to his calculations,

of course, when the designs of an organisation

separate and distinct from his own failed in their purpose.

It was part of his plan to hold the misguided

Reds responsible for the lamentable death of Prince

Robin. The people were to be given swift, uncontrovertible

proof that he had no hand in the unforeseen transactions

of the anarchists, who, he would make it appear,

had by curious coincidence elected to kill the Prince

almost at the very hour when he planned to seize the

city as a conqueror.
His own connection with the operations of the mysterious

Committee of Ten was never to be known to the

world. He would see to that.
At nine o'clock on Sunday morning a small group of

people gathered in the square: a meeting was soon in

progress. A goods-box stood over against the very

spot on which Olga Platanova died. An old man began

haranguing the constantly growing crowd, made up

largely of those whose curiosity surpassed discreetness.

In the group might have been seen every member of the

Committee of Ten, besides a full representation of those

who up to now had secretly affiliated with the Party of

Equals. A red flag waved above the little, excited group

of fanatics, close to the goods-box rostrum. One member

of the Committee was absent from this, their first

public espousal of the cause. Later on we are to discover

who this man was. Two women in bright red waists

were crying encouragement to the old man on the box,

whose opening sentences were no less than an unchanted

requiem for the dead martyr, Olga Platanova.
In the midst of his harangue, the hand of William

Spantz was arrested in one of its most emphatic gestures.

A look of wonder and uncertainty came into his face as

he gazed, transfixed, over the heads of his hearers in the

direction of the Tower.
Peter Brutus was approaching, at the head of a group

of aliens, all armed and marching in ominously good

order. Something in the face of Peter Brutus sent a

chill of apprehension into the very soul of the old

armourer.
And well it may have done so.
"One moment!" called out Peter Brutus, lifting his

hand imperatively. The speaker ceased his mouthings.

"Count Marlanx desires the immediate presence of the

following citizens at his office in the Tower. I shall call

off the names." He began with William Spantz. The

name of each of his associates in the Committee of Ten

followed. After them came a score of names, all of them

known to be supporters of the anarchist cause.
"What is the business, Peter?" demanded William

Spantz.
"Does it mean we are to begin so soon the establishing

of the new order—" began Anna Cromer, her face

aglow. Peter smiled wanly.
"Do not ask me," he said, emphasising the pronoun.

"I am only commanded to bring the faithful few before

him."
"But why the armed escort?" growled Julius Spantz,

who had spent an unhappy twenty-four hours in bondage.
"To separate the wheat from the chaff," said Peter.

"Move on, good people, all you whose names were not

called." The order was to the few timid strangers who

were there because they had nowhere else to go. They

scattered like chaff.
Ten minutes later every member of the Committee of

Ten, except Peter Brutus, was behind lock and bar, together

with their shivering associates, all of them

dumbly muttering to themselves the awful sentence that

Marlanx had passed upon them.
"You are to die at sunset. Graustark still knows how

to punish assassins. She will make an example of you

to-day that all creatures of your kind, the world over,

will not be likely to forget in a century to come. There

is no room in Graustark for anarchy. I shall wipe it

out to-day."
"Sir, your promise!" gasped William Spantz. "We

are your friends—the true Party of—"
"Enough! Do not speak again! Captain Brutus, you

will send criers abroad to notify the citizens that I,

Count Marlanx, have ordered the execution of the ringleaders

in the plot to dynamite the Prince. At sunset,

in the square. Away with the carrion!"
Then it was, and not till then, that the Committee of

Ten found him out! Then it was that they came to

know Peter Brutus! What were their thoughts, we

dare not tell: their shrieks and curses were spent against

inpenetrable floors and walls. Baron Dangloss heard,

and, in time, understood. Even he shrank back and

shuddered.
It has been said that Marlanx was a soldier. There is

one duty that the soldier in command never neglects:

the duty to those who fell while fighting bravely for or

against him. Sunday afternoon a force of men was set

to work burying the dead and clearing the pavements.

Those of his own nondescript army who gave up their

lives on the 26th were buried in the public cemeteries.

The soldiers of the Crown, as well as the military police,

were laid to rest in the national cemetery, with honours

befitting their rank. Each grave was carefully marked

and a record preserved. In this way Marlanx hoped

to obtain his first footing in the confidence and esteem

of the citizens. The unrecognisable corpse of Olga

Platanova was buried in quicklime outside the city walls.

There was something distinctly gruesome in the fact

that half a dozen deep graves were dug alongside hers,

hours before death came to the wretches who were to

occupy them.
At three o'clock the Iron Count coolly sent messengers

to the homes of the leading merchants and bankers of

the city. They, with the priests, the doctors, the municipal

officers and the manufacturers were commanded to

appear before him at five o'clock for the purpose of

discussing the welfare of the city and its people. Hating,

yet fearing him, they came; not one but felt in his heart

that the old man was undisputed ruler of their destinies.

Hours of horror and despair, a night and a day of

bitter reflection, had brought the trembling populace to

the point of seeing clearly the whole miserable situation.

The reserves were powerless; the Royal Guard was besieged

and greatly outnumbered; the fortress was lost.

There was nothing for them to do but temporise. Time

alone could open the way to salvation.
Marlanx stated his position clearly. He left no room

for doubt in their minds. The strings were in his hands:

he had but to pull them. The desire of his life was about

to be attained. Without hesitation he informed the

leading men of the city that he was to be the Prince of

Graustark.
"I have the city," he said calmly. "The farms and

villages will fall in line. I do not worry over them.

In a very short time I shall have the Castle. The question

for you to decide for yourselves is this: will you be

content to remain here as thrifty, peaceable citizens,

protecting your fortunes and being protected by a man

and not by a child. If not, please say so. The alternative

is in the hands of the Crown. I am the Crown. The

Crown may at any time confiscate property and banish

malcontents and disturbers. A word to the wise, gentlemen.

Inside of a week we will have a new government.

You will not suffer under its administration. I should

be indeed a fool to destroy the credit or injure the integrity

of my own dominion. But, let me say this,

gentlemen," he went on after a pause, in which his

suavity gave way to harshness; "you may as well understand

at the outset that I expect to rule here. I will

rule Graustark or destroy her."
The more courageous in his audience began to protest

against the high-handed manner in which he proposed

to treat them. Not a few declared that they would

never recognise him as a prince of the realm. He waited,

as a spider waits, until he thought they had gone far

enough. Then he held up his hand and commanded

silence.
"Those of you who do not expect or desire to live

under my rule—which, I promise you, shall be a wise

one,—may leave the city for other lands just as soon

as my deputies have completed the formal transfer of

all your belongings to the Crown treasury—all, I say,

even to the minutest trifle. Permit me to add, in that

connection, gentlemen: the transfer will not be a prolonged

affair."
They glared back at him and subsided into bitter

silence.
"I am well aware that you love little Prince Robin. Ha!

You may not cheer here, gentlemen, under penalty of my

displeasure. It is quite right that you should, as loyal

subjects, love your Prince, whoever he may be. I shall

certainly expect it. Now, respecting young master

Robin: I have no great desire to kill him."
He waited to see the effect of this brutal announcement.

His hearers stiffened and—yes, they held their breath.
"He has one alternative—he and his lords. I trust

that you, as sensible gentlemen, will find the means to

convey to him your advice that he seize the opportunity

I shall offer him to escape with his life. No one really

wants to see the little chap die. Let me interrupt myself

to call to your attention the fact that I am punishing

the anarchists at sunset. This to convince you that

assassination will not be tolerated in Graustark. To

resume: the boy may return to America, where he belongs.

He is more of an American than one of us. I

will give him free and safe escort to the United States.

Certain of his friends may accompany him; others

whom I shall designate will be required to remain here

until I have disposed of their cases as I see fit. These

conditions I shall set forth in my manifesto to the

present occupant of the Castle. If he chooses to accept

my kindly terms, all well and good. If not, gentlemen,

I shall starve him out or blow the Castle down about

his smart little ears. You shudder! Well, I can't blame

you. I shudder myself sometimes when I think of it.

There will be a great deal of royal blood, you know. Ah,

that reminds me: It may interest you to hear that I

expect to establish a new nobility in Graustark. The

present house of lords is objectionable to me. I trust

I may now be addressing at least a few of the future

noble lords of Graustark. Good day, gentlemen. That

is all for the present. Kindly inform me if any of my

soldiers or followers overstep the bounds of prudence.

Rapine and ribaldry will not be tolerated."
The dignitaries and great men of the city went away,

dazed and depressed, looking at each other from bloodshot

eyes. Not one friend had Marlanx in that group,

and he knew it well. He did not expect them to submit

at once or even remotely. They might have smiled,

whereas they frowned, if they could have seen him

pacing the floor of his office, the moment the doors closed

behind their backs, clenching his hands and cursing

furiously.
At the Castle the deepest gloom prevailed. It was like

a nightmare to the beleaguered household, a dream from

which there seemed to be no awakening. Colonel Quinnox's

first act after posting his forces in position to

repel attacks from the now well-recognised enemy, was

to make sure of the safety of his royal master. Inside

the walls of the Castle grounds he, as commander of the

Royal Guard, ruled supreme. General Braze tore off

his own epaulets and presented himself to Quinnox as a

soldier of the file; lords and dukes, pages and ministers,

followed the example of the head of the War Department.

No one stood on the dignity of his position; no

one does, as a rule, with the executioner staring him in the

face. Every man took up arms for the defence of the

Castle, its Prince and its lovely women.
Prince Robin, quite recovered from his fright, donned

the uniform of a Colonel of the Royal Dragoons, buckled

on his jewelled sword, and, with boyish zeal, demanded

Colonel Quinnox's reasons for not going forth to slay the

rioters.
"What is the army for, Colonel Quinnox?" he asked

with impatient wonder.
It was late in the afternoon and the Prince was seated

in the chair of state, presiding over the hurriedly called

Council meeting. Notably absent were Baron Dangloss

and the Duke of Perse. Chief officers of the Guard and

the commissioned men of the army were present—that

is, all of them who had not gone down under the treacherous fire.
"Your Highness," said the Colonel bitterly, "the real

army is outside the walls, not inside. We are a pitiful

handful-less than three hundred men, all told, counting

the wounded. Count Marlanx heads an army of

several thousand. He—"
"He wants to get in here so's he can kill me? Is that

so, Colonel Quinnox?" The Prince was very pale, but

quite calm.
"Oh, I wouldn't put it just that way, your—"
"Oh, I know. You can't fool me. I've always known

that he wants to kill me. But how can he? That's the

question; how can he when I've got the Royal Guard to

keep him from doing it? He can't whip the Royal

Guard. Nobody can. He ought to know that. He

must be awful stupid."
His perfect, unwavering faith in the Guard was the

same that had grown up with every prince of Graustark

and would not be gainsaid. A score of hearts swelled

with righteous pride and as many scabbards rattled as

heels clicked and hands went up in salute.
"Your Highness," said Quinnox, with a glance at his

fellow-officers, "you may rely upon it, Count Marlanx

will never reach you until he has slain every man in the

Royal Guard."
"And in the army—our poor little army," added General

Braze.
"Thank you," said the Prince. "You needn't have

told me. I knew it." He leaned back in the big chair,

almost slipping from the record books on which he sat,

a brave scowl on his face. "Gee, I wish he'd attack us

right now," he said, with ingenuous bravado.
The council of war was not a lengthy one. The storm

that had arisen out of a perfectly clear sky was briefly

discussed in all its phases. No man there but realised the

seriousness of the situation. Count Halfont, who

seemed ten years older than when we last saw him, addressed

the Cabinet.
"John Tullis is still outside the city walls. If he does

not fall into a trap through ignorance of the city's

plight, I firmly believe he will be able to organise an

army of relief among the peasants and villagers. They

are loyal. The mountaineers and shepherds, wild fellows

all, and the ones who have fallen into the spider's net.

Count Marlanx has an army of aliens; they are not even

revolutionists. John Tullis, if given the opportunity,

can sweep the city clear of them. My only fear is that

he may be tricked into ambush before we can reach him.

No doubt Marlanx, in devising a way to get him out of

the city, also thought of the means to keep him out."
"We must get word to Tullis," cried several in a breath.

A dozen men volunteered to risk their lives in the attempt

to find the American in the hills. Two men were chosen—by

lot. They were to venture forth that very night.
"My lords," said the Prince, as the Council was on the

point of dissolving, "is it all right for me to ask a question

now?"
"Certainly, Robin," said the Prime Minister.
"Well, I'd like to know where Mr. King is."
"He's safe, your Highness," said Quinnox.
"Aunt Loraine is worried, that's all. She's sick, you

see—awful sick. Do you think Mr. King would be

good enough to walk by her window, so's she can see for

herself? She's in the royal bedchamber."
"The royal bedchamber?" gasped the high chamberlain.
"I gave up my bed right off, but she won't stay in it.

She sits in the window most of the time. It's all right

about the bed. I spoke to nurse about it. Besides, I

don't want to go to bed while there's any fighting going

on. So, you see, it's all right. Say, Uncle Caspar, may

I take a crack at old Marlanx with my new rifle if I

get a chance? I've been practising on the target range,

and Uncle Jack says I'm a reg'lar Buffalo Bill."
Count Halfont unceremoniously hugged his wriggling

grand-nephew. A cheer went up from the others.
"Long live Prince Robin!" shouted Count Vos Engo.
Prince Robin looked abashed. "I don't think I could

hit him," he said with becoming modesty. They laughed

aloud. "But, say, don't forget about Mr. King. Tell

him I want him to parade most of the time in front of

my windows."
"He has a weak ankle," began Colonel Quinnox lamely.
"Very difficult for him to walk," said Vos Engo, biting

his lips.
The Prince looked from face to face, suspicion in his

eyes. It dawned on him that they were evading the

point. A stubborn line appeared between his brows.
"Then I command you, Colonel Quinnox, to give him

the best horse in the stables. I want him to ride."
"It shall be as you command, your Highness."
A few minutes later, his grand-uncle, the Prime

Minister, was carrying him down the corridor; Prince

Robin was perched upon the old man's shoulder, and was

a thoughtful mood.
"Say, Uncle Caspar, Mr. King's all right, isn't he?"
"He is a very brave and noble gentleman, Bobby. We

owe to his valour the life of the best boy in all the

world."
"Yes, and Aunt Loraine owes him a lot, too. She says

so. She's been crying, Uncle Caspar. Say, has she

just got to marry Count Vos Engo?"
"My boy, what put that question into your mind?"
"She says she has to. I thought only princes and

princesses had to marry people they don't want to."
"You should not believe all that you hear."
Bobby was silent for twenty steps. Then he said:

"Well, I think she'll make an awful mistake if she lets

Mr. King get away."
"My boy, we have other affairs to trouble us at present

without taking up the affairs of Miss Tullis."
"Well, he saved her life, just like they do in story

books," protested the Prince.
"Well, you run in and tell her this minute that Mr.

King sends his love to her and begs her to rest easy.

See if it doesn't cheer her up a bit."
"Maybe she's worried about Uncle Jack. I never

thought about that," he faltered.
"Uncle Jack will come out on top, never fear," cried

the old man.
Half an hour later, Truxton King, shaven and shorn,

outfitted and polished, received orders to ride for twenty

minutes back and forth across the Plaza. He came

down from Colonel Quinnox's rooms in the officer's row,

considerably mystified, and mounted the handsome bay

that he had brought through the gates. Haddan, of

the Guard, rode with him to the Plaza, but could offer

no explanation for the curious command.
Five times the now resentful American walked his horse

across the Plaza, directly in front of the terrace and the

great balconies. About him paced guardsmen, armed

and alert; on the outer edge of the parade ground a

company of soldiers were hurrying through the act of

changing the Guard; in the lower balcony excited men

and women were walking back and forth, paying not the

least attention to him. Above him frowned the grey,

lofty walls of the Castle. No one was in view on the

upper balcony, beyond which he had no doubt lay the

royal chambers. He had the mean, uncomfortable feeling

that people were peering at him from remote windows.
Suddenly a small figure in bright red and gold and

waving a tiny sword appeared at the rail of the broad

upper gallery. Truxton blinked his eyes once or, twice

and then doffed his hat. The Prince was smiling eagerly.
"Hello!" he called. Truxton drew rein directly below

him.
"I trust your Highness has recovered from the shock

of to-day," he responded. "I have been terribly anxious.

Are you quite well?"
"Quite well, thank you." He hesitated for a moment,

as if in doubt. Then: "Say, Mr. King, how's your

leg?"
Truxton looked around in sudden embarrassment. A

number of distressed, white-faced ladies had paused in

the lower gallery and were staring at him in mingled

curiosity and alarm. He instantly wondered if Colonel

Quinnox's riding clothes were as good a fit as he had

been led to believe through Hobbs and others.
"It's—it's fine, thank you," he called up, trying to

subdue his voice as much as possible.
Bobby looked a trifle uncertain. His glance wavered

and a queer little wrinkle appeared between his eyes.

He lowered his voice when he next spoke.
"Say, would you mind shouting that a little louder,"

he called down, leaning well over the rail.
Truxton flushed. He was pretty sure that the Prince

was not deaf. There was no way out of it, however, so

he repeated his communication.
"It's all right, your Highness."
Bobby gave a quick glance over his shoulder at one

of the broad windows. Truxton distinctly saw the blinds

close with a convulsive jerk.
"Thanks! Much obliged! Good-bye!" sang out the

Prince, gleefully. He waved his hand and then hopped

off the chair on which he was standing. Truxton heard

his little heels clatter across the stone balcony. For a

moment he was nonplused.
"Well, I'm—By Jove! I understand!" He rode off

toward the barracks, his head swimming with joy, his

heart jumping like mad. At the edge of the parade

ground he turned in his saddle and audaciously lifted

his hat to the girl who, to his certain knowledge, was

standing behind the tell-tale blind.
"Cheer up, Hobbs!" he sang out in his new-found

exuberance as he rode up to the dismal Englishman,

who moped in the shade of the stable walls. "Don't be

down-hearted. Look at me! Never say die, that's my

motto."
"That's all very well, sir," said Hobbs, removing the

unlighted pipe from his lips, "but you 'aven't got a dog

and a parrot locked up in your rooms with no one to

feed them. It makes me sick, 'pon my soul, sir, to

think of them dying of thirst and all that, and me here

safe and sound, so to speak."
That night Haddan and a fellow-subaltern attempted

to leave the Castle grounds by way of the private gate

in the western wall, only to be driven back by careful

watchers on the outside. A second attempt was made

at two o'clock. This time they went through the crypt

into the secret underground passage. As they crawled

forth into the blackest of nights, clear of the walls,

they were met by a perfect fusillade of rifle shots. Haddan's

companion was shot through the leg and arm and

it was with extreme difficulty that the pair succeeded in

regaining the passage and closing the door. No other

attempt was made that night. Sunday night a quick

sortie was made, it being the hope of the besieged that

two selected men might elude Marlanx's watch-dogs

during the melee that followed. Curiously enough, the

only men killed were the two who had been chosen to run

the gauntlet in the gallant, but ill-timed attempt to

reach John Tullis.
On Monday morning the first direct word from Count

Marlanx came to the Castle. Under a flag of truce, two

of his men were admitted to the grounds. They presented

the infamous ultimatum of the Iron Count. In brief, it

announced the establishment of a dictatorship pending

the formal assumption of the crown by the conqueror.

With scant courtesy the Iron Count begged to inform

Prince Robin that his rule was at an end. Surrender

would result in his safe conduct to America, the home of

his father; defiance would just so surely end in death

for him and all of his friends. The Prince was given

twenty-four hours in which to surrender his person to

the new governor of the city. With the expiration of

the time limit mentioned, the Castle would be shelled from

the fortress, greatly as the dictator might regret the

destruction of the historic and well-beloved structure.

No one would be spared if it became necessary to bombard;

the rejection of his offer of mercy would be taken

as a sign that the defenders were ready to die for a lost

cause. He would cheerfully see to it that they died as

quickly as possible, in order that the course of government

might not be obstructed any longer than necessary.
The defenders of the Castle tore his message in two and

sent it back to him without disfiguring it by a single

word in reply. The scornful laughter which greeted

the reading of the document by Count Halfont did not

lose any of its force in the report that the truce-bearers

carried, with considerable uneasiness, to the Iron

Count later on.
No one in the Castle was deceived by Marlanx's promise

to provide safe conduct for the Prince. They knew

that the boy was doomed if he fell into the hands of this

iniquitous old schemer. More than that, there was not

a heart among them so faint that it was not confident

of eventual victory over the usurper. They could hold

out for weeks against starvation. Hope is an able provider.
A single, distant volley at sunset had puzzled the men

on guard at the Castle. They had no means of knowing

that the Committee of Ten and its wretched friends

had been shot down like dogs in the Public Square.

Peter Brutus was in charge of the squad of executioners.
Soon after the return of Marlanx's messengers to the

Tower, a number of carriages were observed approaching

in Castle Avenue. They were halted a couple of

hundred yards from the gates and once more a flag of

truce was presented. There was a single line from

Marlanx:

"I am sending indisputable witnesses to bear testimony

to the thoroughness of my conquest.


"MARLANX."


Investigation convinced the captain of the Guard that

the motley caravan in the avenue was made up of loyal,

representative citizens from the important villages of

the realm. They were admitted to the grounds without

question.
The Countess Prandeville of Ganlook, terribly agitated,

was one of the first to enter the haven of safety,

such as it was. After her came the mayors and the

magistrates of a dozen villages. Count Marlanx's reason

for delivering these people over to their friends in

the Castle was at once manifest.
By the words of their mouths his almost complete

mastery of the situation was conveyed to the Prince's

defenders. In every instance the representative from

a village sorrowfully admitted that Marlanx's men were

in control. Ganlook, an ancient stronghold, had been

taken without a struggle by a handful of men. The

Countess's husband was even now confined in his own

castle under guard.
The news was staggering. Count Halfont had based

his strongest hopes on the assistance that would naturally

come from the villages. Moreover, the strangely

commissioned emissaries cast additional gloom over the

situation by the report that mountaineers, herdsmen and

woodchoppers in the north were flocking to the assistance

of the Iron Count, followed by hordes of outlaws

from the Axphain hills. They were swarming into the

city. These men had always been thorns in the sides of

the Crown's peace-makers.
"It is worse than I thought," said Count Halfont, after

listening to the words of the excited magistrates. "Are

there no loyal men outside these walls?"
"Thousands, sir, but they are not organised. They

have no leader, and but little with which to fight against

such a force."
"It is hard to realise that a force of three or four thousand

desperadoes has the power to defy an entire kingdom.

A city of 75,000 people in the hands of hirelings!

The shame of it!"
Truxton King was leaning against a column not far

from the little group, nervously pulling away at the

pipe Quinnox had given him. As if impelled by a common

thought, a half dozen pairs of eyes were turned in

his direction. Their owners looked as quickly away,

again moved by a common thought.
The Minister of Mines gave utterance to a single sentence

that might well have been called the epitome of

that shrewd, concentrated thought:
"There must be some one who can get to John Tullis

before it is too late."
They looked at one another and then once more at the

American who had come among them, avowedly in quest

of adventure.

CHAPTER XIX
TRUXTON EXACTS A PROMISE
Truxton King had been in a resentful frame of mind

for nearly forty-eight hours. In the first place, he had

not had so much as a single glimpse of the girl he now

worshipped with all his heart. In the second place, he

had learned, with unpleasant promptness, that Count

Vos Engo was the officer in command of the House

Guard, a position as gravely responsible as it was honourable.

The cordon about the Castle was so tightly drawn

in these perilous hours that even members of the household

were subjected to examination on leaving or entering.
Truxton naturally did not expect to invade the Castle

in search of the crumb of comfort he so ardently desired;

he did not, however, dream that Vos Engo would deny

him the privilege of staring at a certain window from a

rather prim retreat in a far corner of the Plaza.
He had, of course, proffered his services to Colonel

Quinnox. The Colonel, who admired the Americans,

gravely informed him that there was no regular duty

to which he could be assigned, but that he would expect

him to hold himself ready for any emergency. In case

of an assault, he was to report to Count Vos Engo.
"We will need our bravest men at the Castle," he had

said. Truxton glowed under the compliment. "In the

meantime, Mr. King, regain your strength in the park.

You show the effect of imprisonment. Your adventures

have been most interesting, but I fancy they invite rest

for the present."
It was natural that this new American should become

an object of tremendous interest to every one in and

about the Castle. The story of his mishaps and his

prowess was on every lip; his timely appearance in

Regengetz Circus was regarded in the light of divine

intervention, although no one questioned the perfectly

human pluck that brought it about. Noble ladies smiled

upon him in the park, to which they now repaired with

timorous hearts; counts and barons slapped him on the

back and doughty guardsmen actually saluted him with

admiration in their eyes.
But he was not satisfied. Loraine had not come forward

with a word of greeting or relief; in fact, she had

not appeared outside the Castle doors. Strangely

enough, with the entire park at his disposal, he chose to

frequent those avenues nearest the great balconies.

More than once he visited the grotto where he had first

seen her; but it was not the same. The occasional crack

of a rifle on the walls no longer fired him with the

interest he had felt in the beginning. Forty-eight

hours had passed and she still held aloof. What could

it mean? Was she ill? Had she collapsed after the

frightful strain?
Worse than anything else: was she devoting all of her

time to Count Vos Engo?
Toward dusk on Monday, long after the arrival of the

refugees, he sat in gloomy contemplation of his own

unhappiness, darkly glowering upon the unfriendly

portals from a distant stone bench.
A brisk guardsman separated himself from the knot

of men at the Castle doors and crossed the Plaza toward

him.
"Aha," thought Truxton warmly, "at last she is sending

a message to me. Perhaps she's—no, she couldn't

be sending for me to come to her."
Judge his dismay and anger when the soldier, a bit

shamefaced himself, briefly announced that Count Vos

Engo had issued an order against loitering in close

proximity to the Castle. Mr. King was inside the limit

described in the order. Would he kindly retire to a

more distant spot, etc.
Truxton's cheek burned. He saw in an instant that

the order was meant for him and for no one else—he

being the only outsider likely to come under the head

of "loiterer." A sharp glance revealed the fact that

not only were the officers watching the little scene, but

others in the balcony were looking on.
Resisting the impulse to argue the point, he hastily

lifted his hat to the spectators and turned into the

avenue without a word.
"I am sorry, sir," mentioned the guardsman earnestly.
Truxton turned to him with a frank smile, meant for

the group at the steps. "Please tell Count Vos Engo

that I am the last person in the world to disregard

discipline at a time like this."
His glance again swept the balcony, suddenly becoming

fixed on a couple near the third column. Count Vos

Engo and Loraine Tullis were standing there together,

unmistakably watching his humiliating departure. To

say that Truxton swore softly as he hurried off through

the trees would be unnecessarily charitable.
The next morning he encountered Vos Engo near the

grotto. Two unsuccessful attempts to leave the Castle

grounds had been made during the night. Truxton had

aired his opinion to Mr. Hobbs after breakfast.
"I'll bet my head I could get away with it," he had

said, doubly scornful because of a sleepless night. "They

go about it like a lot of chumps. No wonder they are

chased back."
Catching sight of Vos Engo, he hastened across the

avenue and caught up to him. The Count was apparently

deep in thought.
"Good morning," said Truxton from behind. The

other whirled quickly. He did not smile as he eyed the

tall American. "I haven't had a chance to thank you

for coming back for me last Saturday. Allow me to

say that it was a very brave thing to do. If I appeared

ungrateful at the time, I'm sure you understood my

motives."
"The whole matter is of no consequence, Mr. King,"

said the other quietly.
"Nevertheless, I consider it my duty to thank you. I

want to get it out of my system. Having purged myself

of all that, I now want to tell you of a discovery that

I made last evening."
"I am not at all interested."
"You will be when I have told you, however, because

it concerns you."
"I do not like your words, Mr. King, nor the way in

which you glare at me."
"I'm making it easier to tell you the agreeable news,

Count Vos Engo; that's all. You'll be delighted to

hear that I thought of you nearly all night and still

feel that I have not been able to do you full justice."
"Indeed?" with a distinct uplifting of the eyebrows.
"Take your hand off your sword, please. Some other

time, perhaps, but not in these days when we need men,

not cripples. I'll tell you what I have discovered and

then we'll drop the matter until some other time. We

can afford a physical delay, but it would be heartless to

keep you in mental suspense. Frankly, Count, I have

made the gratifying discovery that you are a damned

cur."
Count Vos Engo went very white. He drew his dapper

figure up to its full height, swelled his Robin Redbreast

coat to the bursting point, and allowed his right hand

to fly to his sword. Then, as suddenly, he folded his

arms and glared at Truxton.
"As you say, there is another and a better time. We

need dogs as well as men in these days."
"I hope you won't forget that I thanked you for coming

back last Saturday."
The Count turned and walked rapidly away.
Truxton leaned against the low wall alongside the

Allée. "I don't know that I've helped matters any," he

said to himself ruefully. "He'll not let me get within

half a mile of the Castle after this. If she doesn't come

out for a stroll in the park, I fancy I'll never see her—Heigho!

I wish something would happen! Why

doesn't Marlanx begin bombarding? It's getting

devilish monotonous here."
He strolled off to the stables, picking up Mr. Hobbs

on the way.
"Hobbs," he said, "we've got to find John Tullis,

that's all there is to it." He was scowling fiercely at

a most inoffensive lawn-mower in the grass at the left.
"I daresay, sir," said Mr. Hobbs with sprightly decisiveness.

"He's very much needed."
"I'm going to need him before long as my second."
"Your second, sir? Are you going to fight a duel?"
"I suppose so," lugubriously. "It's too much to expect

him to meet me with bare fists. Oh, Hobbs, I wish we

could arrange it for bare knucks!" He delivered a

mighty swing at an invisible adversary. Hobbs's hat

fell off with the backward jerk of surprise.
"Oh, my word!" he exclaimed admiringly, "wot a

punch you've got!"
Later on, much of his good humour was restored and

his vanity pleased by a polite request from Count

Halfont to attend an important council in the "Room

of Wrangles" that evening at nine.
Very boldly he advanced upon the Castle a few

minutes before the appointed hour. He went alone, that

he might show a certain contempt for Count Vos Engo.

Notwithstanding the fact that he started early enough

for the Chamber, he was distressingly late for the

meeting.
He came upon Loraine Tullis at the edge of the

Terrace. She was walking slowly in the soft shadows

beyond the row of lights on the lower gallery. King

would have passed her without recognition, so dim was

the light in this enchanted spot, had not his ear caught

the sound of a whispered exclamation. At the same

time the girl stopped abruptly in the darkest shadow.

He knew her at a glance, this slim girl in spotless white.
"Loraine!" he whispered, reaching her side in two

bounds. She put out her hands and he clasped them.

A quick, hysterical little laugh came from her lips.

Plainly, she was confused. "I've been dying for a

glimpse of you. Do you think you've treated me—"
"Don't, Truxton," she pleaded, suddenly serious. She

sent a swift glance toward the balconies. "You must

not come here. I saw—well, you know. I was so

ashamed. I was so sorry."
He still held her hands. His heart was throbbing

furiously.
"Yes, they ordered me to move on, as if I were a common

loafer," he said, with a soft chuckle. "I'm used

to it, however. They ran me out of Meshed for taking

snapshots; they banished me from Damascus, and they

all but kicked me out of Jerusalem—I won't say why.

But where have you kept yourself? Why have you

avoided me? After getting the Prince to parade me

in front of your windows, too. It's dirt mean, Loraine."
"I have been ill, Truxton—truly, I have," she said

quickly, uneasily.
"See here, what's wrong? You are in trouble. I can

tell by your manner. Tell me—trust me."
"I am worried so dreadfully about John," she faltered.
"That isn't all," he declared. "There's something

else. What promise did you make to Vos Engo last

Saturday after—well, if you choose to recall it—after

I brought you back to him—what did you promise

him?"
"Don't be cruel, Truxton," she pleaded. "I cannot

forget all you have done for me."
"You told Vos Engo to ride back and pick me up,"

he persisted. "He told me in so many words. Now, I

want a plain answer, Loraine. Did you promise to

reward him if he—well, if he saved me from the mob?"
She was breathlessly silent for a moment. "No," she

said, in a low voice.
"What was it, then? I must know, Loraine." He was

bending over her, imperiously.
"I am very—oh, so very unhappy, Truxton," she

murmured. He was on the point of clasping her in his

arms and kissing her. But he thought better of it.
"I came near spoiling everything just now," he

whispered hoarsely.
"What?"
"I almost kissed you, Loraine,—I swear it was hard

to keep from it. That would have spoiled everything."
"Yes, it would," she agreed quickly.
"I'm not going to kiss you until you have told me you

love Vos Engo."
"I—I don't understand," she cried, drawing back and

looking up into his face with bewildered eyes.
"Because then I'll be sure that you love me."
"Be sensible, Truxton."
"I'll know that you promised to love him if he'd save

me. It's as clear as day to me. You did tell him you'd

marry him if he got me to a place of safety."
"No. I refused to marry him if he did not save you.

Oh, Truxton, I am so miserable. What is to become of

all of us? What is to become of John, and Bobby—and

you?"
"I—I think I'll kiss you now, Loraine," he whispered

almost tremulously. "God, how I love you, little

darling!"
"Don't!" she whispered, resolutely pushing him away

after a sweet second of indecision. "I cannot—I cannot,

Truxton dear. Don't ask me to—to do that. Not

now, please—not now!"
He stiffened; his hands dropped to his sides, but there

was joy in his voice.
"I can wait," he said gently. "It's only a matter of

a few days; and I—I won't make it any harder for you

just now. I think I understand. You've—you've sort

of pledged yourself to that—to him, and you don't

think it fair to—well, to any of us. I'm including you,

you see. I know you don't love him, and I know that

you're going to love me, even if you don't at this very

instant. I'm not a very stupid person, after all. I can

see through things. I saw through it all when he came

back for me. That's why I jumped from his horse and

took my chances elsewhere. He did a plucky thing,

Loraine, but I—I couldn't let it go as he intended it to

be. Confound him, I would have died a thousand times

over rather than have you sacrifice yourself in that way.

It was splendid of you, darling, but—but very foolish.

You've got yourself into a dreadful mess over it. I've

got to rescue you all over again. This time, thank the

Lord, from a Castle."
She could not help smiling. His joyousness would not

be denied.
"How splendid you are!" she said, her voice thrilling

with a tone that could not be mistaken.
He put his hands upon her shoulders and looked down

into the beautiful, upturned face, a genuinely serious

note creeping into his voice when he spoke again.
"Don't misconstrue my light-heartedness, dearest. It's

a habit with me, not a fault. I see the serious side to

your affair—as you view it. You have promised to

marry Vos Engo. You'll have to break that promise.

He didn't save me. Colonel Quinnox would have accomplished

it, in any event. He can't hold you to such

a silly pledge. You—you haven't by any chance told

him that you love him?" He asked this in sudden

anxiety.
"Really, Truxton, I cannot discuss—"
"No, I'm quite sure you haven't," he announced contentedly.

"You couldn't have done that, I know. Now,

I want you to make me a promise that you'll keep."
"Oh, Truxton—don't ask me to say that I'll be your—"

She stopped, painfully embarrassed.
"That will come later," he said consolingly. "I want

you to promise, on your sacred word of honour, that

you'll kiss no man until you've kissed me."
"Oh!" she murmured, utterly speechless.
"Promise!"
"I—I cannot promise that," she said in tones almost

inaudible. "I am not sure that I'll ever—ever kiss anybody.

How silly you are!"
"I'll make exception in the case of your brother—and,

yes, the Prince."
"I'll not make such a promise," she cried.
"Then, I'll be hanged if I'll save you from the ridiculous

mess you've gotten yourself into," he announced

with finality. "Moreover, you're not yet safe from old

Marlanx. Think it over, my—"
"Oh, he cannot seize the Castle—it is impossible!" she

cried in sudden terror.
"I'm not so sure about that," he said laconically.
"What is it you really want me to say?" she asked,

looking up with sudden shyness in her starry eyes.
"That you love me—and me only, Loraine," he

whispered.
"I will not say it," she cried, breaking away from

him. "But," as she ran to the steps, a delicious tremor

in her voice—"I will consider the other thing you ask."
"Darling—don't go," he cried, in eager, subdued

tones, but she already was half way across the balcony.

In a moment she was gone. "Poor, harassed little

sweetheart!" he murmured, with infinite tenderness. For

a long time he stood there, looking at the window

through which she had disappeared, his heart full of

song.
Then, all at once, he remembered the meeting. "Great

Scott!" in dismay. "I'm late for the pow-wow." A

twisted smile stole over his face. "I wonder how they've

managed to get along without me." Then he presented

himself, somewhat out of breath, to the attendants at

the south doors, where he had been directed to report. A

moment later he was in the Castle of Graustark, following

a stiff-backed soldier through mediæval halls of

marble, past the historic staircase, down to the door of

the council chamber. He was filled with the most delicious

sensation of awe and reverence. Only in his

dearest dreams had he fancied himself in these cherished

halls. And now he was there—actually treading the

same mosaic floors that had known the footsteps of

countless princes and princesses, his nostrils tingling

with the rare incense of five centuries, his blood leaping

to the call of a thousand romances. The all but mythical

halls of Graustark—the sombre, vaulted, time-defying

corridors of his fancy. Somewhere in this vast pile of

stone was the girl he loved. Each shadowy nook, each

velvety recess, seemed to glow with the wizardry of love-lamps

that had been lighted with the building of the

Castle. How many hearts had learned the wistful lesson

in these aged halls? How many loves had been

sheltered here?
He walked on air. He pinched himself—and even

then was not certain that he was awake. It was too

good to be true.
He was ushered into a large, sedately furnished room.

A score of men were there before him—sitting or standing

in attitudes of attention, listening to the words of

General Braze. King's entrance was the signal for an

immediate transfer of interest. The General bowed

most politely and at once turned to Count Halfont with

the remark that he had quite finished his suggestions.

The Prime Minister came forward to greet the momentarily

shy American. King had time to note that the

only man who denied him a smile of welcome was Count

Vos Engo. He promptly included his rival in his own

sweeping, self-conscious smile.
"The Council has been extolling you, Mr. King," said

the Prime Minister, leading him to a seat near his own.

Truxton sat down, bewildered. "We may some day

grow large enough to adequately appreciate the invaluable,

service you have performed in behalf of Graustark."
Truxton blushed. He could think of nothing to say,

except: "I'm sorry to have been so late. I was detained."
Involuntarily he glanced at Vos Engo. That gentleman

started, a curious light leaping into his eyes.
"Mr. King, we have asked you here for the purpose of

hearing the full story of your experiences during the

past two weeks, if you will be so good as to relate them.

We have had them piecemeal. I need not tell you that

Graustark is in the deepest peril. If there is a single

suggestion that you can make that will help her to-night,

I assure you that it will be given the most grateful

consideration. Graustark has come to know and

respect the resourcefulness and courage of the American

gentleman. We have seen him at his best."
"I have really done no more than to—er—save my

own neck," said Truxton simply. "Any one might be

excused for doing the same. Graustark owes a great

deal more to Miss Tullis than it does to me, believe me,

my lords. She had the courage, I the strength."
"Be assured of our attitude toward Miss Tullis," said

Halfont in reply. "Graustark loves her. It can do no

more than that. It is from Miss Tullis that we have

learned the extent of your valorous achievements. Ah,

my dear young friend, she has given you a fair name.

She tells us of a miracle and we are convinced."
Truxton stammered his remonstrances, but glowed with

joy and pride.
"Here is the situation in a nutshell," went on the Prime

Minister. "We are doomed unless succor reaches us

from the outside. We have discussed a hundred projects.

While we are inactive, Count Marlanx is gaining

more power and a greater hold over the people of the

city. We have no means of communication with Prince

Dantan of Dawsbergen, who is our friend. We seem

unable to get warning to John Tullis, who, if given

time, might succeed in collecting a sufficient force of

loyal countrymen to harass and eventually overthrow

the Dictator. Unless he is reached before long, John

Tullis and his combined force of soldiers will be ambushed

and destroyed. I am loth to speak of another

alternative that has been discussed at length by the

ministers and their friends. The Duke of Perse, from

a bed of pain and anguish, has counselled us to take

steps in the direction I am about to speak of. You see,

we are taking you into our confidence, Mr. King.
"We can appeal to Russia in this hour of stress.

Moreover, we may expect that help will be forthcoming.

But we will have to make an unpleasant sacrifice. Russia

is eager to take over our new issue of railway bonds.

Hitherto, we have voted against disposing of the bonds

in that country, the reason being obvious. St. Petersburg

wants a new connecting line with her possessions

in Afghanistan. Our line will provide a most direct

route—a cut-off, I believe they call it. Last year the

Grand Duke Paulus volunteered to provide the money

for the construction of the line from Edelweiss north

to Balak on condition that Russia be given the right to

use the line in connection with her own roads to the

Orient. You may see the advantage in this to Russia.

Mr. King, if I send word to the Grand Duke Paulus,

agreeing to his terms, which still remain open to us,

signing away a most valuable right in what we had

hoped would be our own individual property, we have

every reason to believe that he will send armed forces

to our relief, on the pretext that Russia is defending

properties of her own. That is one way in which we

may oust Count Marlanx. The other lies in the ability

of John Tullis to give battle to him with our own people

carrying the guns. I am confident that Count Marlanx

will not bombard the Castle except as a last resort. He

will attempt to starve us into submission first; but he

will not destroy property if he can help it. I have been

as brief as possible. Lieutenant Haddan has told us

quite lately of a remark you made which he happened to

overhear. If I quote him correctly, you said to the

Englishman Hobbs that you could get away with it,

meaning, as I take it, that you could succeed in reaching

John Tullis. The remark interested me, coming as it

did from one so resourceful. May I not implore you to

tell us how you would go about it?"
Truxton had turned a brick red. Shame and mortification

surged within him. He was cruelly conscious of an

undercurrent of irony in the Premier's courteous request.

For an instant he was sorely crushed. A low

laugh from the opposite side of the room sent a shaft

to his soul. He looked up. Vos Engo was still smiling.

In an instant the American's blood boiled; his manner

changed like a flash; blind, unreasoning bravado succeeded

embarrassment.
He faced Count Halfont coolly, almost impudently.
"I think I was unfortunate enough to add that your

men were going about it—well, like amateurs," he said,

with a frank smile. "I meant no offense." Then he

arose suddenly, adjusted his necktie with the utmost

sang froid, and announced:
"I did say I could get to John Tullis. If you like,

I'll start to-night."
His words created a profound impression, they came

so abruptly. The men stared at him, then at each

other. It was as if he had read their thoughts and had

jumped at once to the conclusion that they were baiting

him. Every one began talking at once. Soon some

one began to shake his hand. Then there were cheers

and a dozen handshakings. Truxton grimly realised

that he had done just what they had expected him to do.

He tried to look unconcerned.
"You will require a guide," said Colonel Quinnox, who

had been studying the degage American in the most

earnest manner.
"Send for Mr. Hobbs, please," said Truxton.
A messenger was sent post haste to the barracks. The

news already was spreading throughout the Castle. The

chamber door was wide open and men were coming and

going. Eager women were peering through the doorway

for a glimpse of the American.
"There should be three of us," said King, addressing

the men about him. "One of us is sure to get away."
"There is not a man here—or in the service—who will

not gladly accompany you, Mr. King," cried General

Braze quickly.
"Count Vos Engo is the man I would choose, if I may

be permitted the honour of naming my companion,"

said Truxton, grinning inwardly with a malicious joy.
Vos Engo turned a yellowish green. His eyes bulged.
"I—I am in command of the person of his Royal

Highness," he stammered, suddenly going very red.
"I had forgotten your present occupation," said Truxton

quietly. "Pray pardon the embarrassment I may

have caused you. After all, I think Hobbs will do.

He knows the country like a book. Besides, his business

in the city must be very dull just now. He'll be

glad to have the chance to personally conduct me for a

few days. As an American tourist, I must insist, gentlemen,

on being personally conducted by a man from

Cook's."
They did not know whether to laugh or to treat it as

a serious announcement.
Mr. Hobbs came. That is to say, he was produced.

It is doubtful if Mr. Hobbs ever fully recovered from

the malady commonly known as stage fright. He had

never been called Mr. Hobbs by a Prime Minister before,

nor had he ever been asked in person by a Minister

of War if he had a family at home. Moreover, no assemblage

of noblemen had ever condescended to unite in

three cheers for him. Afterward Truxton King was

obliged to tell him that he had unwaveringly volunteered

to accompany him on the perilous trip to the hills. Be

sure of it, Mr. Hobbs was not in a mental condition

for many hours to even remotely comprehend what had

taken place. He only knew that he had been invited,

as an English gentleman, to participate in a council of

war.
But Mr. Hobbs was not the kind to falter, once he had

given his word; however hazy he may have been at the

moment, he knew that he had volunteered to do something.

Nor did it seem to surprise him when he finally

found out what it was.
"We'll be off at midnight, Hobbs," said Truxton, feeling

in his pocket for the missing watch.
"As you say, Mr. King, just as you say," said Hobbs

with fine indifference.
As Truxton was leaving the Castle ten minutes later,

Hobbs having gone before to see to the packing of

food-bags and the filling of flasks, a brisk, eager-faced

young attendant hurried up to him.
"I bear a message from his Royal Highness," said the

attendant, detaining him.
"He should be sound asleep at this time," said Truxton,

surprised.
"His Royal Highness insists on staying awake as long

as possible, sir. It is far past his bedtime, but these

are troublesome times, he says. Every man should do

his part. Prince Robin has asked for you, sir."
"How's that?"
"He desires you to appear before him at once, sir."
"In—in the audience chamber?"
"In his bedchamber, sir. He is very sleepy, but says

that you are to come to him before starting away on

your mission of danger."
"Plucky little beggar!" cried Truxton, his heart swelling

with love for the royal youngster.
"Sir!" exclaimed the attendant, his eyes wide with

amazement and reproof.
"I'll see him," said the other promptly, as if he were

granting the audience.
He followed the perplexed attendant up the grand

staircase, across thickly carpeted halls in which posed

statuesque soldiers of the Royal Guard, to the door of

the Prince's bedchamber. Here he was confronted by

Count Vos Engo.
"Enter," said Vos Engo, with very poor grace, standing

aside. The sentinels grounded their arms and Truxton

King passed into the royal chamber, alone.

CHAPTER XX
BY THE WATER-GATE
It was a vast, lofty apartment, regal in its subdued

lights. An enormous, golden bed with gorgeous hangings

stood far down the room. So huge was this royal

couch that Truxton at first overlooked the figure sitting

bolt upright in the middle of it. The tiny occupant

called out in a very sleepy voice:
"Here I am, Mr. King. Gee, I hate a bed as big as

this. They just make me sleep in it."
An old woman advanced from the head of the couch

and motioned Truxton to approach.
"I am deeply honoured, your Highness," said the

visitor, bowing very low. Through the windows he

could see motionless soldiers standing guard in the

balcony.
"Come over here, Mr. King. Nurse won't let me get

up. Excuse my nighty, will you, please? I'm to have

pajamas next winter."
Truxton advanced to the side of the bed. His eyes

had swept the room in search of the one person he

wanted most to see of all in the world. An old male

servitor was drawing the curtains at the lower end of

the room. There was no one else there, except the

nurse. They seemed as much a part of the furnishings

of this room as if they had been fixtures from the

beginning.
"I am sure you will like them," said Truxton, wondering

whether she were divinely secreted in one of the

great, heavily draped window recesses. She had been

in this room but recently. A subtle, delicate, enchanting

perfume that he had noticed earlier in the evening—ah,

he would never forget it.
The Prince's legs were now hanging over the edge of

the bed. His eyes were dancing with excitement; sleep

was momentarily routed.
"Say, Mr. King, I wish I was going with you to find

Uncle Jack. You will find him, won't you? I'm going

to say it in my prayers to-night and every night. They

won't hardly let me leave this room. It's rotten luck.

I want to fight, too."
"We are all fighting for you, Prince Robin."
"I want you to find Uncle Jack, Mr. King," went on

Bobby eagerly. "And tell him I didn't mean it when

I banished him the other day. I really and truly didn't."

He was having difficulty in keeping back the tears.
"I shall deliver the message, your Highness," said

Truxton, his heart going out to the unhappy youngster.

"Rest assured of that, please. Go to sleep and dream

that I have found him and am bringing him back to

you. The dream will come true."
"Are you sure?" brightening perceptibly.
"Positively."
"Americans always do what they say they will," said

the boy, his eyes snapping. "Here's something for you

to take with you, Mr. King. It's my lucky stone. It

always gives good luck. Of course, you must promise

to bring it back to me. It's an omen."
He unclasped his small fingers; in the damp palm lay

one of those peculiarly milky, half-transparent pebbles,

common the world over and of value only to small,

impressionable boys. Truxton accepted it with profound

gravity.
"I found it last 4th of July, when we were celebrating

out there in the park. I'm always going to have a 4th

of July here. Don't you lose it, Mr. King, and you'll

have good luck. Baron Dangloss says it's the luckiest

kind of a stone. And when you come back, Mr. King,

I'm going to knight you. I'd do it now, only Aunt

Loraine says you'd be worrying about your title all the

time and might be 'stracted from your mission. I'm

going to make a baron of you. That's higher than a

count in Graustark. Vos Engo is only a count."
Truxton started. He looked narrowly into the frank,

engaging eyes of the boy in the nighty.
"I shall be overwhelmed," he said. Then his hand went

to his mouth in the vain effort to cover the smile that

played there.
"My mother used to say that American girls liked

titles," said the Prince with ingenuous candor.
"Yes?" He hoped that she was eavesdropping.
"Nurse said that I was not to keep you long, Mr.

King," said the Prince ruefully. "I suppose you are

very busy getting ready. I just wanted to give you my

lucky stone and tell you about being a baron. I won't

have any luck till you come back. Tell Mr. Hobbs I'm

thinking of making him a count. You're awful brave,

Mr. King."
"Thank you, Prince Robin. May I—" he glanced uneasily

at the distant nurse—"may I ask how your

Aunt Loraine is feeling?"
"She acted very funny when I sent for you. I'm worried

about her."
"What did she do, your Highness?"
"She rushed off to her room. I think, Mr. King, she

was getting ready to cry or something. You see, she's

in trouble."
"In trouble?"
"Yes. I can't tell you about it."
"She's worried about her brother, of course—and

you."
"I just wish I could tell you—no, I won't. It wouldn't

be fair," Bobby said, checking himself resolutely. "She's

awful proud of you. I'm sure she likes you, Mr. King."
"I'm very, very glad to hear that."
Bobby had great difficulty in keeping his most secret

impressions to himself. In fact, he floundered painfully

in an attack on diplomacy.
"You should have seen her when Uncle Caspar came

in to say you were going off to find her brother. She

cried. Yes, sir, she did. She kissed me and—but you

don't like to hear silly things about girls, do you? Great

big men never do."
"I've heard enough to make me want to do something

very silly myself," said Truxton, radiant. "I—I don't

suppose I could—er—see your Aunt Loraine for a

few minutes?"
"I think not. She said she just—now, you mustn't

mind her, Mr. King—she just couldn't bear it, that's

all. She told me to say she'd pray for you and—Oh,

Mr. King, I do hope she won't marry that other man!"
Truxton bent his knee. "Your Highness, as it seems

I am not to see her, and as you seem to be the very best

friend I have, I should very much like to ask a great

favour of you. Will you take this old ring of mine

and wish it on her finger just as soon as I have left

your presence?"
"How did you know she was coming in again?" in

wide-eyed wonder. "Excuse me. I shouldn't ask questions.

What shall I wish?" It was the old ring that

had come from Spantz's shop. The Prince promptly hid

it beneath the pillow.
"I'll leave that to you, my best of friends."
"I bet it'll be a good wish, all right. I know what to

wish."
"I believe you do. Would you mind giving her something

else from me?" He hesitated before venturing the

second request. Then, overswept by a warm, sweet impulse,

he stepped forward, took the boy's face between

his eager hands, and pressed a kiss upon his forehead.

"Give her that for me, will you, Prince Robin Goodfellow."
Bobby beamed. "But I never kiss her there!"
"I shall be ten thousand times obliged, your Highness,

if you will deliver it in the usual place."
"I'll do it!" almost shouted the Prince. Then he

clapped his hand over his mouth and looked, pop-eyed

with apprehension, toward the nurse.
"Then, good-bye and God bless you," said Truxton.

"I must be off. Your Uncle Jack is waiting for me, up

there in the hills."
Bobby's eyes filled with tears. "Oh, Mr. King, please

give him my love and make him hurry back. I—I need

him awful!"
Truxton found Mr. Hobbs in a state bordering on

collapse.
"I say, Mr. King, it's all right to say we'll go, but

how the deuce are we to do it? My word, there's no more

chance of getting out of the—"
"Listen, Hobbs: we're going to swim out," said Truxton.

He was engaged in stuffing food into a knapsack.

Colonel Quinnox and Haddan had been listening to

Hobbs's lamentations for half an hour, in King's room.
"Swim? Oh, I say! By hokey, he's gone clean daffy!"

Hobbs was eyeing him with alarm. The others looked

hard at the speaker, scenting a joke.
"Not yet, Hobbs. Later on, perhaps. I had occasion

to make a short tour of investigation this afternoon.

Doubtless, gentlemen, you know where the water-gate

is, back of the Castle. Well, I've looked it over—and

under, I might say. Hobbs, you and I will sneak under

those slippery old gates like a couple of eels. I forgot

to ask if you can swim."
"To be sure I can. Under the gates? My word!"
"Simple as rolling off a log," said Truxton carelessly.

"The Cascades and Basin of Venus run out through the

gate. There is a space of at least a foot below the

bottom of the gate, which hasn't been opened in fifty

years, I'm told. A good swimmer can wriggle through,

d'ye see? That lets him out into the little canal that

connects with the river. Then—"
"I see!" cried Quinnox. "It can be done! No one will

be watching at that point."
The sky was overcast, the night as black as ebony.

The four men left the officers' quarters at one o'clock,

making their way to the historic old gate in the glen

below the Castle. Arriving at the wall, Truxton briefly

whispered his plans.
"You remember, Colonel Quinnox, that the stream is

four or five feet deep here at the gate. The current

has washed a deeper channel under the iron-bound

timbers. The gates are perhaps two feet thick. For

something like seven or eight feet from the bottom they

are so constructed that the water runs through an open

network of great iron bars. Now, Hobbs and I will go

under the gates in the old-clothes you have given us.

When we are on the opposite side we'll stick close by the

gate, and you may pass our dry clothes out between the

bars above the surface of the water. Our guns, the

map and the food, as well. It's very simple. Then we'll

drop down the canal a short distance and change our

clothes in the underbrush. Hobbs knows where we can

procure horses and he knows a trusty guide on the other

side of the city. So long, Colonel. I'll see you later."
"God be with you," said Quinnox fervently. The four

men shook hands and King slipped into the water without

a moment's hesitation.
"Right after me, Hobbs," he said, and then his head

went under.
A minute later he and Hobbs were on the outside of the

gate, gasping for breath. Standing in water to their

necks, Quinnox and Haddan passed the equipment

through the barred openings. There were whispered

good-byes and then two invisible heads bobbed off in the

night, wading in the swift-flowing canal, up to their

chins. Swimming would have been dangerous, on

account of the noise.
Holding their belongings high above their heads, with

their hearts in their mouths, King and the Englishman

felt their way carefully along the bed of the stream.

Not a sound was to be heard, except the barking of dogs

in the distance. The stillness of death hung over the

land. So still, that the almost imperceptible sounds they

made in breathing and moving seemed like great volumes

of noise in their tense ears.
A hundred yards from the gate they crawled ashore

and made their way up over the steep bank into the

thick, wild underbrush. Not a word had been spoken

up to this time.
"Quietly now, Hobbs. Let us get out of these duds.

'Gad, they're like ice. From now on, Hobbs, you lead

the way. I'll do my customary act of following."
Hobbs was shivering from the cold. "I say, Mr. King,

you're a wonder, that's wot you are. Think of going

under those bally gates!"
"That's right, Hobbs, think of it, but don't talk."
They stealthily stripped themselves of the wet garments,

and, after no end of trouble, succeeded in getting

into the dry substitutes. Then they lowered the wet

bundles into the water and quietly stole off through the

brush, Hobbs in the lead, intent upon striking the King's

Highway, a mile or two above town. It was slow, arduous

going, because of the extreme caution required. A

wide detour was made by the canny Hobbs—wider, in

fact, than the impatient American thought wholly necessary.

In time, however, they came to the Highway.
"Well, we've got a start, Hobbs. We'll win out, just

as I said we would. Easy as falling off a log."
"I'm not so blooming sure of that," said Hobbs. He

was recalling a recent flight along this very road.

"We're a long way from being out of the woods."
"Don't be a kill-joy, Hobbs. Look at the bright side

of things."
"I'll do that in the morning, when the sun's up," said

Hobbs, with a sigh. "Come along, sir. We take this

path here for the upper road. It's a good two hours'

walk up the mountain to Rabot's, where we get the

horses."
All the way up the black, narrow mountain path

Hobbs kept the lead. King followed, his thoughts divided

between the blackness ahead and the single, steady

light in a certain window now far behind. He had seen

the lighted window in the upper balcony as he passed the

Castle on the way to the gate. Somehow he knew she

was there saying good-bye and Godspeed to him.
At four o'clock, as the sun reached up with his long,

red fingers from behind the Monastery mountain, Truxton

King and Hobbs rode away from Rabot's cottage

high in the hills, refreshed and sound of heart. Rabot's

son rode with them, a sturdy, loyal lad, who had leaped

joyously at the chance to serve his Prince. Undisturbed,

they rode straight for the passes below St. Valentine's.

Behind and below them lay the sleeping, restless, unhappy

city of Edelweiss, with closed gates and unfriendly,

sullen walls. There reigned the darkest fiend

that Graustark, in all her history, had ever come to

know.
Truxton King had slipped through his fingers with

almost ridiculous ease. So simple had it been, that the

two messengers, gloating in the prospect ahead, now

spoke of the experience as if it were the most trivial

thing in their lives. They mentioned it casually; that

was all.
Now, let us turn to John Tullis and his quest in the

hills. It goes without saying that he found no trace of

his sister or her abductors. For five days he scoured the

lonely, mysterious mountains, dragging the tired but

loyal hundred about at his heels, distracted by fear and

anguish over the possible fate of the adored one. On

the fifth day, a large force of Dawsbergen soldiers, led

by Prince Dantan himself, found the fagged, disspirited

American and his half-starved men encamped in a rocky

defile in the heart of the wilderness.
That same night a Graustark mountaineer passed the

sentinels and brought news of the disturbance in Edelweiss.

He could give no details. He only knew that

there had been serious rioting in the streets and that

the gates were closed against all comers. He could not

tell whether the rioters—most of whom he took to be

strikers, had been subdued or whether mob-law prevailed.

He had been asked to cast his lot with the strikers, but

had refused. For this he was driven away from his home,

which was burned. His wife and child were now at the

Monastery, where many persons had taken refuge.
In a flash it occurred to John Tullis that Marlanx was

at the bottom of this deviltry. The abduction of

Loraine was a part of his plan! Prince Dantan advised

a speedy return to the city. His men were at the

command of the American. Moreover, the Prince himself

decided to accompany the troops.
Before sunrise, the command, now five or six hundred

strong, was picking its way down the dangerous mountain

roads toward the main highway. Fifteen miles below

Edelweiss they came upon the company of soldiers

sent out to preserve order in the railroad camps.
The officer in charge exhibited a document, given under

the hand and seal of Baron Dangloss, directing him to

remain in command of the camps until the strikers, who

were unruly, could be induced to resume work once more.

This order, of course, was a forgery, designed to mislead

the little force until Marlanx saw fit to expose his

hand to the world. It had come by messenger on the

very day of the rioting. The messenger brought the

casual word that the government was arresting and

punishing the lawless, and that complete order would

hardly be established for several days at the outside.

He went so far as to admit that an attempt on the life

of the Prince had failed. Other reports had come to

the camps, and all had been to the effect that the rioting

was over. The strikers, it seemed, were coming to terms

with their employers and would soon take up the work of

construction once more. All this sufficed to keep the

real situation from reaching the notice of the young

captain; he was obeying orders and awaiting the return

of the workmen.
The relief that swept into the souls of the newly arrived

company was short-lived. They had gone into

camp, tired, sore and hungry, and were preparing to

take a long needed rest before taking up the last stage

of their march toward the city. John Tullis was now in

feverish haste to reach the city, where at least he might

find a communication from the miscreants, demanding

ransom. He had made up his mind to pay whatever

they asked. Down in his heart, however, there was a

restless fear that she had not fallen into the hands of

ordinary bandits. He could not banish the sickening

dread that she was in the power of Marlanx, to whom

she alone could pay the ransom exacted.
Hardly had the men thrown themselves from their

horses when the sound of shooting in the distance struck

their ears. Instantly the entire force was alert. A dozen

shots were fired in rapid succession; then single reports

far apart. The steady beat of horses' feet was now

plain to the attentive company. There was a quick,

incisive call to arms; a squad stood ready for action.

The clatter of hoofs drew nearer; a small group of

horsemen came thundering down the defile. Three

minutes after the firing was first heard, sentries threw

their rifles to their shoulders and blocked the approach

of the riders.
A wild, glad shout went up from the foremost horseman.

He had pulled his beast to its haunches almost

at the muzzles of the guns.
"Tullis!" he shouted, waving his hat.
John Tullis ran toward the excited group in the road.

He saw three men, one of whom was shouting his name

with all the power in his lungs.
"Thank God, we've found you!" cried the horseman,

swinging to the ground despite the proximity of strange

rifles. "Put up your guns! We're friends!"
"King!" exclaimed Tullis, suddenly recognising him.

A moment later they were clasping hands.
"This is luck! We find you almost as soon as we set

out to do so. Glory be! You've got a fair-sized army,

too. We'll need 'em—and more."
"What has happened, King? Where have you been?

We looked for you after your disap—"
"That's ancient history," interrupted the other. "How

soon can you get these troops on the march? There's

not a moment to be lost."
"Good God, man, tell me what it is—what has happened?

The Prince? What of him?" cried Tullis,

grasping King's arm in the clutch of a vise.
"He sends his love and rescinds the order of exile,"

said King, smiling. Then seriously: "Marlanx has

taken the city. It was all a game, this getting rid of

you. He's superstitious about Americans. There was

bomb-throwing in the square and a massacre afterward.

The Prince and all the others are besieged in the Castle.

I'll tell you all about it. Hobbs and I are the only men

who have got away from the Castle alive. We left

last night. Our object was to warn you in time to prevent

an ambush. You've got to save the throne for

Prince Robin. I'll explain as we go along. I may as

well inform you right now that there's a big force of

men waiting for you in the ravine this side of the

Monastery. We saw them. Thank God, we got to you

in time. You can now take 'em by surprise and—whiff!

They'll run like dogs. Back here a couple of miles

we came upon a small gang of real robbers. We had a

bit of shooting and—I regret to say—no one was

bagged. I'd advise you to have this force pushed along

as rapidly as possible. I have a message from your

sister, sir."
"Loraine? Where is she, King?"
"Don't tremble like that, old man. She's safe enough—in

the Castle. Oh, it was a fine game Marlanx had

in his mind."
While the troopers were making ready for the march,

Truxton King and Hobbs related their story to eager,

horrified groups of officers. It may be well to say that

neither said more of his own exploits than was absolutely

necessary to connect the series of incidents. Prince

Dantan marvelled anew at this fresh demonstration of

Yankee courage and ingenuity. King graphically narrated

the tale from beginning to end. The full force

of the amazing tragedy was brought home to the pale,

half-dazed listeners. There were groans and curses and

bitter cries of vengeance. John Tullis was crushed;

despair was written in his face, anguish in his eyes.
What was to become of the Prince?
"First of all, Tullis, we must destroy these scoundrels

who are lying in wait for you in the ravine," said Prince

Dantan. "After that you can be in a position to breathe

easily while collecting the army of fighters that Mr.

King suggests. Surely, you will be able to raise a large

and determined force. My men are at Prince Robin's

disposal. Captain Haas may command them as his

own. I deplore the fact that I may not call upon the

entire Dawsbergen army. Marlanx evidently knows our

laws. Our army cannot go to the aid of a neighbor.

We have done so twice in half a century and our people

have been obliged to pay enormous indemnity. But

there are men here. I am here. We will not turn back,

Mr. Tullis. My people will not hold me at fault for

taking a hand in this. I shall send messengers to the

Princess; she, of course, must know."
The battalion, augmented by the misguided company

from the deserted railroad camps, moved swiftly into the

defile, led by young Rabot. Truxton King rode beside

the brother of the girl he loved, uttering words of cheer

and encouragement.
"King, you do put new courage into me. You are

surcharged with hope and confidence. By heaven, I believe

we can drive out that damned beast and his dogs.

We will do it!"
"There's a chap named Brutus. I ask special permission

to kill him. That's the only request I have to

make."
"I very strongly oppose the appeal to Grand Duke

Paulus. We must act decisively before that alternative

is forced upon the unhappy Halfont. It was Perse's

scheme, months ago. Perse! Confound him, I believe

he has worked all along to aid—"
"Hold on, Tullis," interrupted King soberly. "I

wouldn't say that if I were you. The Duke was wounded

by the dynamiters and I understand he lies on his bed

and curses Marlanx from morning till night. He prays

constantly that his daughter may be freed from the old

scoundrel."
"The Countess Ingomede—has anything been heard

from her?" asked Tullis. He had been thinking of her

for days—and nights.
"Well, nothing definite," said King evasively. He was

reminded at this moment of his own love affair. Seized

by the boldest impulse that had ever come to him, he

suddenly blurted out: "Tullis, I love your sister. I

have loved her from the beginning. All that has happened

in the last week has strengthened my adoration.

I think she cares for me, but,—but—"
"My dear Mr. King, I'm sorry—" began Tullis,

genuinely surprised.
"But it seems that she's promised to marry Vos Engo.

I'll tell you how it happened." Then he related the

episode of the rout in Castle Avenue. "It's all wrong

for her to marry that chap. If she hasn't been bullied

into it before we get back to her, I'd like to know if

you won't put a stop to his damned impudence. What

right has such a fellow as Vos Engo to a good American

girl like Loraine? None whatever. Besides, I'm going

to fight him when we're through fighting Marlanx. I

want you as my second. Can't say whether it will be

swords, pistols or knuckles. I hope you'll oblige me.

As a matter of fact, I had two primary objects in looking

you up out here in the hills. First, to ask you for

Loraine; second, to engage you as my second."
Tullis was silent for a while. Then he said, quite

seriously: "King, I have looked with some favour upon

Vos Engo. I thought she liked him. He isn't a bad

fellow, believe me. I want Loraine to be happy. As

for this promise to him, I'll talk that over with her—if

God permits me to see her again I shall allow her

to choose, King. You or Vos Engo—the one she loves,

that's all. As for seconding you, I am at your service."
King beamed. "That means, I take it, that you want

me to win at least one of the contests. Well," with his

whimsical, irresistible smile, "it won't be necessary to

try for the other if Vos Engo shoots me in this one."
"You will never know the extent of my gratitude,

King. You have saved her from a hellish fate. I shall

be disappointed in her if she does not choose you. I

owe you a debt of gratitude almost as great for saving

that dear little boy of—ours. I shall not forget what

you have done—never!"
Early in the afternoon the force under Captain Haas

was divided into three companies, for strategic purposes.

The plan to surprise and defeat the skulkers in the ravine

had been carefully thought out. Two strong companies

struck off into the hills; the third and weakest of

the trio kept the road, apparently marching straight

into the trap. Signals had been arranged. At a given

sign the three parties were to swoop down upon the

position held by the enemy.
Several hours passed. The troop in the highroad prepared

to camp just below the treacherous pass in which

the ambush was known to be laid. Scouts had located

the confident rascals in the ravines above the highway.

With the news that their prey was approaching, they

were being rapidly rushed into position at the head of

the pass.
Shortly before sunset the troop in the road began to

advance, riding resolutely into the ravine. Even as

the gloating, excited desperadoes prepared to open fire

from their hidden position at the head of the pass, their

pickets came running in with the word that two large

forces were drawing in on them from the north and

east.
The trappers were trapped. They realised that they

had been out-generalled, and they understood their deficiencies.

Not a man among them knew the finer points

of warfare. They were thugs and roustabouts and ill-omened

fellows who could stab in the back; they were

craven in the face of an open peril.
There were few shots fired. The men in ambuscade

tried to escape to the fastnesses of the hills. Some of

them stood ground and fought, only to be mown down

by the enemy; others were surrounded and made captive;

but few actually succeeded in evading the troopers. All

were ready to sue for mercy and to proclaim their

willingness to divert allegiance from dictator to Crown.

Herded like so many cattle, guarded like wolves, they

were driven city-ward, few if any of them exhibiting the

slightest symptom of regret or discomfiture. In fact,

they seemed more than philosophic: they were most

jovial. These were soldiers of fortune, in the plainest

sense. It mattered little with whom they were allied or

against whom they fought, so long as the pay was

adequate and prompt.
Indeed, the leaders of the party—officers by grace of

lucky tosses—benignly proffered the services of themselves

and men in the movement to displace Count

Marlanx!
"He cannot hold out," said the evil-faced captain in

cool derision. "He cannot keep his promises to us. So

why should we cut our own throats? All we ask is transportation

to Austria after the job's over. That's where

most of us came from, your Excellencies. Count on us,

if you need us. Down with Marlanx!"
"Long live Prince—" Three-fourths of them stopped

there because they did not even know the name of the

little ruler.

CHAPTER XXI
THE RETURN
From the highlands below the Monastery, Captain Haas

and his men were able to study the situation in the city.

The impracticability of an assault on any one of the

stubborn, well-guarded gates was at once recognised. A

force of seven hundred men, no matter how well trained

or determined, could not be expected to surmount walls

that had often withstood the attack of as many thousands.

The wisdom of delaying until a few thousand

loyal, though poorly armed countrymen could be

brought into play against the city appealed at once to

Prince Dantan and John Tullis.
Withdrawing to an unexposed cut in the hills, safe

from the shells that might be thrown up from the

fortress, they established their camps, strongly entrenched

and practically invulnerable against any attack

from below. Squads of men were sent without delay

into the hills and valleys to call the panic-stricken,

wavering farmers into the fold. John Tullis headed the

company that struck off into the well-populated Ganlook

district.
Marlanx, as if realising the nature of the movement in

the hills, began a furious assault on the gates leading to

the Castle. The watchers in the hills could see as well

as hear the conflict that raged almost at their feet, so

to speak. They cheered like mad when the motley army

of the usurper was frustrated in the attempt to take the

main gates. From the walls about the park, Quinnox's

men, few as they were, sent such deadly volleys into the

streets below that the hordes fell back and found shelter

behind the homes of the rich. With half an eye, one

could see that the rascals were looting the palaces, secure

from any opposition on the part of the government

forces; through the glasses, scattered crowds of men

could be seen carrying articles from the houses; more

than one of the mansions went up in flames as the day

grew old and the lust of the pillagers increased.
The next morning, Captain Haas announced to his

followers that Marlanx had begun to shell the Castle.

Big guns in the fortress were hurling great shells over

the city, dropping them in the park. On the other hand,

Colonel Quinnox during the night had swung three

Gatling guns to the top of the wall; they were stationed

at intervals along the wall, commanding every point

from which an assault might be expected. It was a

well-known fact that there was no heavy ordnance at

the Castle. All day long, Marlanx's men, stationed in

the upper stories of houses close to the walls, kept up a

constant rifle fire, their bullets being directed against the

distant windows of the Castle. That this desultory

fusillade met with scant response at the hands of Quinnox,

was quite apparent to the uneasy, champing

watchers near the Monastery.
"Marlanx will not begin the actual bombardment until

he knows that Tullis is drawing together a formidable

force," prophesied Prince Dantan.
"But when he does begin the real shelling," mourned

Truxton King, chafing like a lion under the deadly inaction.

"I can't bear the thought of what it means to

those inside the Castle. He can blow it to pieces over

their heads. Then, from the house tops, he can pick

them off like blackbirds. It's awful! Is there nothing

that we can do, Prince? Damn it all, I know we can

force a gate. And if we once get in where those

cowardly dogs are lording it, you'll see 'em take the walls

like steeple-chasers."
"My dear Mr. King," said Prince Dantan calmly,

"you don't know Colonel Quinnox and the House Guard.

The Quinnoxs have guarded Graustark's rulers for I

don't know how many generations. History does not

go back so far, I fear. You may depend on it, there

will be no living guardsmen inside those walls when

Marlanx lays his hands on the Prince."
That night recruits from the farms and villages began

to straggle into the camp. They were armed with

rifles, ordinary shotguns and antique "blunderbusses;"

swords, staves and aged lances. All were willing to die

in the service of the little Prince; all they needed was a

determined, capable leader to rally them from the state

of utter panic. They reported that the Crown foragers

might expect cheerful and plenteous tribute from

the farmers and stock growers. Only the mountaineers

were hostile.
The army now grew with astonishing rapidity. The

recruits were not fighting men in a military sense, but

their hearts were true and they hungered for the chance

to stamp out the evil that lay at their feet. By the

close of the second day nearly three thousand men were

encamped above the city. Late that night John Tullis

rode into camp at the head of a great company from

the Ganlook province. He had retaken the town of

Ganlook, seized the fortress, and recruited the entire

fighting strength of the neighbourhood. More than

that, he had unlimbered and conveyed to the provisional

camp two of the big guns that stood above the gates at

the fortress. There had been a dozen skirmishes between

the regulars and roving bands of desperadoes.

A savage fight took place at Ganlook and another in the

gap below the witch's hut. In both of these sanguinary

affrays the government forces had come off victorious,

splendid omens that did not fail to put confidence into

the hearts of the men.
Marlanx trained two of his big guns on the camp in

the hills. From the fortress he threw many futile shells

toward their place of shelter. They did no damage;

instead of death, they brought only laughter to the

scornful camp. Under cover of night, the two Ganlook

cannons were planted in a position commanding the

southeastern city gate. It was the plan of the new besiegers

to bombard this gate, tearing it to pieces with

shot. When their force was strong enough offensively,

an assault would be flung against this opening. Drill

and discipline were necessary, however, before the attempt

could be made. In the present chaotic, untrained

condition of their forces, an assault would prove not

only ineffectual, but disastrous. Day after day the

recruits were put through hard drill under the direction

of the regular officers. Every day saw the force increased.

This made hard work for the drill-masters.

The willingness of the recruits, however, lessened the

task considerably.
The knowledge that Marlanx had no big guns except

those stationed in the fortress was most consoling to

Tullis and his friends. He could not destroy the Castle

gates with shells, except by purest chance. He could

drop shells into the Castle, but to hit a gate twenty feet

wide? Never! Field ordnance was unknown to this

country of mountains.
The Iron Count's inability to destroy the Castle gates

made it feasible for the men in the hills to devote

considerable more time to drill and preparation than they

might have sacrificed if the conditions were the reverse.

They were confident that Quinnox could hold the Castle

for many days. With all this in mind, Captain Haas

and Prince Dantan beat down the objections of the impatient

Americans; the work of preparation against

ignominous failure went on as rapidly as possible. Haas

would not attack until he was ready, or it became absolutely

certain that the men at the Castle were in dire

need.
Signalling between the Castle and the hills had been

going on for days. The absence of the "wigwag" system

made it impossible to convey intelligible messages.
Truxton King was growing haggard from worry and

loss of sleep. He could not understand the abominable,

criminal procrastination. He was of a race that did

things with a dash and on the spur of the moment. His

soul sickened day by day. John Tullis, equally unhappy,

but more philosophical, often found him seated upon a

rock at the top of the ravine, an unlighted pipe in his

fingers, his eyes intent upon the hazy Castle.
"Cheer up, King. Our time will come," he was wont

to say.
"I've just got to do something, Tullis. This standing

around is killing me." Again he would respond: "Don't

forget that I love some one down there, old man. Maybe

she's worrying about me, as well as about you." Once

he gave poor Mr. Hobbs a frightful tongue-lashing and

was afterward most contrite and apologetic. Poor

Hobbs had been guilty of asking if he had a headache.
Truxton was assigned to several scouting expeditions,

simply to provide him with action and diverting excitement.

One of these expeditions determined the impossibility

of entering the city through the railroad yards

because of the trestle-work and the barricade of freight

cars at the gap in the wall.
They had been in camp for a week. The stategists had

practically decided that the assault could be made within

a day or two. All was in readiness—or as near as it

could be—and all was enthusiasm and excitement.
"If Haas puts it off another day I'm going to start a

round robin, whatever that is," said Truxton. As he

said it to a Dawsbergen officer who could not understand

English, it is doubtful if that gentleman's polite nod of

acquiescence meant unqualified approval of the project.
At first they had built no fires at night. Now the force

was so formidable that this precaution was unnecessary.

The air was chill and there were tents for but a few of

the troopers. The fires in the ravine always were surrounded

by great circles of men, eagerly discussing the

coming battle. At the upper end of the ravine were the

tents of the officers, Prince Dantan and John Tullis.

The latter shared his with King and Mr. Hobbs. Up

here, the circle about the kindly pile of burning logs

was small, select and less demonstrative. Here they

smoked in silence most of the time, each man's thoughts

delivered to himself.
Above, on the jutting rock, sat the disconsolate, lovesick

Truxton. It was the night before the proposed

assault on the gates. The guns were in position and the

cannonading was to begin at daybreak. He was full

of the bitterness of doubt and misgiving. Was she in

love with Vos Engo? Was the Count's suit progressing

favourably under the fire of the enemy? Was his undoubted

bravery having its effect upon the wavering

susceptibilities of the distressed Loraine?
Here was he, Truxton King, idle and useless for more

than a week, beyond range of the guns of the foe, while

down there was Vos Engo in the thick of it, at the side

of the girl he loved in those long hours of peril, able

to comfort her, to cheer her, to fight for her. It was

maddening. He was sick with uncertainty, consumed by

jealousy. His pipe was not out now: he was smoking

furiously.
The sound of a voice in sharp command attracted his

attention. One of the sentries in the road below the

elbow of the ridge had stopped some one who was approaching

the camp. There was a bright moon, and

Truxton could see other pickets hurrying to join the

first. A few moments later the trespassers were escorted

through the lines and taken directly to headquarters. A

man and two women, King observed. Somewhat interested,

he sauntered down from his lonely boulder and

joined the group of officers.
John Tullis was staring hard at the group approaching

from the roadway. They were still outside the circle of

light, but it was plain to all that the newcomers were

peasants. The women wore the short red skirts and the

pointed bonnets of the lower classes. Gaudy shawls

covered their shoulders. One was tall and slender, with

a bearing that was not peasant-like. It was she who

held Tullis's intense, unbelieving gaze until they were

well inside the fire-light. She walked ahead of her

companions. Suddenly he sprang forward with a cry of

amazement.
It was the Countess Ingomede.
Her arrival created a sensation. In a moment she was

in the centre of an amazed circle of men. Tullis, after

his first low, eager greeting at the edge of the fire

circle, drew her near to the warmth-giving flames. Prince

Dantan and Captain Haas threw rugs and blankets in a

great heap for her to sit upon. Every one was talking

at once. The Countess was smiling through her tears.
"Make room for my maid and her father. They are

colder and more fatigued than I," she said, lifting her

tired, glorious eyes to John Tullis, who stood beside her.

"We have come from Balak. They suffered much, that

I might enjoy the slender comforts I was so ready to

share with them."
"Thank God, you are here," he said in low, intense

tones. She could not mistake the fervour in his voice

nor the glow in his eyes. Her wondrous, yellowish orbs

looked steadily into his, and he was satisfied. They paid

tribute to the emotion that moved him to the depths of

his being. Love leaped up to him from those sweet,

tired eyes; leaped with the unerring force of an electric

current that finds its lodestone in spite of mortal will.
"I knew you were here, John. I am not going back

to Count Marlanx. It is ended."
"I knew it would come, Ingomede. You will let me

tell you how glad I am—some day?"
"Some day, when I am truly, wholly free from him,

John. I know what you will say, and I think you know

what I shall say in reply." Both understood and were

exalted. No other word passed between them touching

upon the thing that was uppermost in their minds.
Food was provided for the wayfarers, and Tullis's tent

was made ready for the Countess and her maid.
"Truxton," said he, "we will have to find other quarters

for the night. I've let my apartment—furnished."
"She's gloriously beautiful, John," was all that Truxton

said, puffing moodily at his pipe. He was thinking

of one more beautiful, however. "I suppose you'd think

it a favour if I'd pot Marlanx for you to-morrow."
"It doesn't matter whether he's potted or not, my friend.

She will not go back to him. He will have to find another

prisoner for his household."
Truxton's thoughts went with a shudder to the underground

room and the fair prisoner who had shared it

with him. The dread of what might have been the

fate of Loraine Tullis—or what might still be in store

for her—brought cold chills over him. He abruptly

turned away and sat down at the outer edge of the

group.
The Countess's story was soon told. Sitting before the

great fire, surrounded by eager listeners, she related her

experiences. Prince Dantan was her most attentive

listener.
She had been seized on the night of the ball as she

started across her father's garden. Before sunrise she

was well on her way to Balak, in charge of three of the

Count's most faithful henchmen. As for the messages

that were sent to Edelweiss, she knew nothing of them,

except the last, which she had managed to get through

with the assistance of Josepha's father. She was kept

a close prisoner in a house just outside of Balak, and

came to learn all of the infamous projects of her

husband. At the end of ten days her maid was sent to

her from Edelweiss. She brought the news of the

calamity that had befallen the city. It was then that

she determined to break away from her captors and try

to reach the Monastery of St. Valentine, where protection

would be afforded her for the time being. After

several days of ardent persuasion, she and Josepha prevailed

upon the latter's father to assist them in their

flight. Not only was he persuaded, but in the end he

journeyed with them through the wildest country north

of Ganlook. They were four days in covering the

distance, partly on foot, partly by horse. Near the

city they heard of the presence of troops near the

Monastery. Farmers' wives told them of the newly

formed army and of its leaders. She determined to make

her way to the camp of those who would destroy her

husband, eager to give them any assistance that her own

knowledge of Marlanx's plans might provide.
Many details are omitted in this brief recital of her

story. Perhaps it is well to leave something to the

imagination.
One bit of information she gave created no end of

consternation among the would-be deliverers of the city.

It had the effect of making them all the more resolute;

the absolute necessity for immediately regaining control

in the city was forced upon them. She told them that

Count Marlanx had lately received word that the Grand

Duke Paulus was likely to intervene before many days,

acting on his own initiative, in the belief that he could

force the government of Graustark to grant the railway

privileges so much desired by his country. Marlanx

realised that he would have to forestall the wily Grand

Duke. If he were in absolute control of the Graustark

government when the Russian appeared, he and he alone

would be in a position to deal with the situation. Unless

the Castle fell into his hands beforehand, insuring the

fall of the royal house and the ministry, the Grand

Duke's natural inclination would be to first befriend the

hapless Prince and then to demand recompense in whatsoever

form he saw fit.
"The Grand Duke may send a large force of men across

the border at any time," said the Countess in conclusion.

"Count Marlanx is sure to make a decisive assault

as soon as he hears that the movement has begun. He

had hopes of starving them out, thus saving the Castle

from destruction, but as that seems unlikely, his shells

will soon begin to rain in earnest upon the dear old pile."
Truxton King was listening with wide open ears. As

she finished this dreary prediction he silently arose to

his feet and, without a word to any one, stalked off in

the darkness. Tullis looked after him and shook his

head sadly.
"I'll be happy on that fellow's account when daybreak

comes and we are really at it," he said to Prince Dantan,

who knew something of King's affliction.
But Truxton King was not there at daybreak. When

he strode out of the camp that night, he left it behind

forever.
The unfortunate lack of means to communicate with the

occupants of the Castle had been the source of great

distress to Captain Haas. If the defenders could be informed

as to the exact hour of the assault from the outside,

they could do much toward its speedy success by

making a fierce sortie from behind their own walls. A

quick dash from the Castle grounds would serve to draw

Marlanx's attention in that direction, diminishing the

force that he would send to check the onslaught at the

gates. But there was no means of getting word to

Colonel Quinnox. His two or three hundred men would

be practically useless at the most critical period of the

demonstration.
Truxton King had all this in mind as he swung off

down the mountain road, having stolen past the sentries

with comparative ease. He was smiling to himself. If

all went well with him, Colonel Quinnox would be able

to rise to the occasion. If he failed in the daring mission

he had elected to perform, the only resulting harm would

be to himself; the plans of the besiegers would not suffer.
He knew his ground well by this time. He had studied

it thoroughly from the forlorn boulder at the top of the

ravine. By skirting the upper walls, on the mountain

side, he might, in a reasonably short space of time, reach

the low woodlands north of the Castle walls. The danger

from Marlanx's scouts outside the city was not great;

they had been scattered and beaten by Haas's recruiting

parties. He stood in more danger from the men he would

help, they who were the watchful defenders of the Castle.
It must have been two o'clock when he crossed the

King's Highway, a mile or more above the northern

gates, and struck down into the same thick undergrowth

that had protected him and Hobbs on a memorable

night not long before.
At three o'clock, a dripping figure threw up his hands

obligingly and laughed with exultation when confronted

by a startled guardsman inside the Castle walls and not

more than fifty yards from the water gates!
He had timed his entrance by the sound of the guardsman's

footstep on the stone protecting wall that lined

the little stream. When he came to the surface inside

the water gate, the sentry was at the extreme end of his

beat. He shouted a friendly cry as he advanced toward

the man, calling out his own name.
Ten minutes later he was standing in the presence of

the haggard, nerve-racked Quinnox, pouring into his

astonished ears the news of the coming attack. While

he was discarding his wet clothing for others, preparations

for the sortie were getting under way. The Colonel

lost no time in routing out the sleeping guardsmen and

reserves, and in sending commands to those already on

duty at the gates. The quick rattle of arms, the rush

of feet, the low cries of relief, the rousing of horses,

soon usurped the place of dreary, deadly calm.
When the sun peeped over the lofty hills, he saw inside

the gates a restless, waiting company of dragoons,

ready for the command to ride forth. Worn, haggard

fellows, who had slept but little and who had eaten

scarcely anything for three days; men who would have

starved to death. Now they were forgetting their

hunger and fatigue in the wild, exultant joy of the

prospect ahead.
Meantime, King had crossed the grounds with

Colonel Quinnox, on the way to the Castle. He was

amazed, almost stupefied by the devastation that already

had been wrought. Trees were down; great, gaping

holes in the ground marked the spots where shells had

fallen; the plaza was an almost impassable heap of

masonry and soil, torn and rent by huge projectiles.

But it was his first clear view of the Castle itself that

appalled the American.
A dozen or more balls had crashed into the façade.

Yawning fissures, gigantic holes, marked the path of the

ugly messengers from Marlanx. Nearly all of the windows

had been wrecked by riflemen who shot from the

roofs of palaces in and about the avenue. Two of the

smaller minarets were in ruins; a huge pillar in the

lower balcony was gone; the terrace had been ploughed

up by a single ricochetting shell.
"Great God!" gasped King. "It is frightful!"
"They began bombarding yesterday afternoon. We

were asked to surrender at three o'clock. Our reply

brought the shells, Mr. King. It was terrible."
"And the loss of life, Colonel?" demanded the other

breathlessly.
"After the first two or three shells we found places of

shelter for the Prince and his friends. They are in the

stone tower beyond the Castle, overlooking what still

remains of the ancient moat. Ah, there are no faltering

hearts here, Mr. King. The most glorious courage instead.

Count Vos Engo guards the Prince and the

ladies of the household. Alas! it was hunger that we

feared the most. To-day we should have resorted to

horse's flesh. There was no other way. We knew that relief

would come some day. John Tullis was there. We

had faith in him and in you. And now it is to-day! This

shall be our day, thank God! Nothing can stand before

us!"
"Tullis is very anxious about his sister," ventured

Truxton. Quinnox looked straight ahead, but smiled.
"She is the pluckiest of them all."
"Is she well?"
"Perhaps a trifle thin, sir, that is all. I dare say that

is due to scarcity of nourishment, although the Prince

and his closest associates were the last to feel deprivation."
"How does the Prince take all this, Colonel?"
"As any Prince of Graustark would, sir. There is no

other way. It is in the blood."
"Poor little chap!"
"He will rejoice to know that you have found his lucky

stone so effective. The Prince has never wavered in his

loyalty to that pebble, sir."
Together they entered the Castle. Inside there were

horrid signs of destruction, particularly off the balconies.
"No one occupies the upper part of the Castle now,

sir."
Attendants sped to the tower, shouting the battle tidings.

No compunction was felt in arousing the sleeping

household. As a matter of fact, there was no protest

from the eager ladies and gentlemen who hurried forth

to hear the news.
The Prince came tumbling down the narrow iron stairs

from his room above, shouting joyously to Truxton

King. No man was ever so welcome. He was besieged

with questions, handshakings and praises. Even the

Duke of Perse, hobbling on crutches, had a kindly greeting

for him. Tears streamed down the old man's cheeks

when King told him of his daughter's safe arrival in

the friendly camp.
Truxton picked the Prince up in his arms and held him

close to his breast, patting his back all the while, his

heart so full that he could not speak.
"I knowed you'd come back," Bobby kept crying in

his ear. "Aunt Loraine said you wouldn't, but I said

you would. I knowed it—I knowed it! And now you're

going to be a baron, sure enough. Isn't he, Uncle

Caspar?"
But Truxton was not listening to the eager prattle.

He remembered afterward that Bobby's hands and face

were hot with fever. Just now he was staring at the

narrow staircase. Vos Engo and Loraine were descending

slowly. The former was white and evidently very

weak. He leaned on the girl for support.
Count Halfont offered the explanation. "Vos Engo

was shot last week, through the shoulder. He is too

brave to give up, as you may see. It happened on the

terrace. There was an unexpected fusilade from the

housetops. Eric placed himself between the marksmen

and Miss Tullis. A bullet that might have killed her

instantly, struck him in the shoulder. They were fleeing

to the balcony. He fell and she dragged him to a place

of safety. The wound is not so serious as it might have

been, but he should be in bed. He, like most of us, has

not removed his clothing in five days and nights."
King never forgot the look in Loraine's eyes as she came

down the steps. Joy and anguish seemed to combine

themselves in that long, intense look. He saw her hand

go to her heart. Her lips were parted. He knew she

was breathing quickly, tremulously.
The Prince was whispering in his ear: "Keep the lucky

stone, Mr. King. Please keep it. It will surely help

you. I gave her your kiss. She was happy—awful

happy for awhile. 'Nen the Count he saved her from

the bullet. But you just keep the lucky stone." King

put him down and walked directly across to meet her

at the foot of the steps.
She gave him her hands. The look in her tired eyes

went straight to his heart. Vos Engo drew back, his

face set in a frown of displeasure.
"My brother?" she asked, without taking her gaze

from his eyes.
"He is well. He will see you to-day."
"And you, Truxton?" was her next question, low and

quavering.
"Unharmed and unchanged, Loraine," he said softly.

"Tell me, did Vos Engo stand between you and the fire

from the—"
"Yes, Truxton," she said, dropping her eyes as if in

deep pain.
"And you have not—broken your promise to him?"
"No. Nor have I broken my promise to you."
"He is a brave man. I can't help saying it," said the

American, deep lines suddenly appearing in his face.

Swiftly he turned to Vos Engo, extending his hand.

"My hand, sir, to a brave man!"
Vos Engo stared at him for a moment and then turned

away, ignoring the friendly hand. A hot flush mounted

to Loraine's brow.
"This is a brave man, too, Eric," she said very quietly.
Vos Engo's response was a short, bitter laugh.

CHAPTER XXII
THE LAST STAND
Soon after five o'clock, a man in the topmost window of

the tower called down that the forces in the hills were

moving in a compact body toward the ridges below the

southern gates.
"Give them half an hour to locate themselves," advised

Truxton King. "They will move rapidly and strike as

soon as the shells have levelled the gates. The proper

time for your sortie, Colonel, would be some time in

advance of their final movement. You will in that way

draw at least a portion of Marlanx's men away from the

heart of the city. They will come to the assistance of

the gang bivouacked beyond the Duke of Perse's

palace."
One hundred picked men were to be left inside the

Castle gates with Vos Engo, prepared to meet any

flank movement that might be attempted. Three hundred

mounted men were selected to make the dash down

Castle Avenue, straight into the camp of the sharpshooters.

It was the purpose of the house guard to

wage a fierce and noisy conflict off the Avenue and then

retire to the Castle as abruptly as they left it, to be

ready for Marlanx, should he decide to make a final

desperate effort to seize their stronghold.
King, fired by a rebellious zeal, elected to ride with the

attacking party. His heart was cold with the fear that

he was to lose Loraine, after all. The fairy princess

of his dreams seemed farther away from him than ever.

"I'll do what I can for the Prince," he said to himself.

"He's a perfect little brick. Damn Vos Engo! I'll

make him repent that insult. Every one noticed it,

too. She tried to smooth it over, but—oh, well, what's

the use!"
The dash of the three hundred through the gates and

down the avenue was the most spectacular experience in

Truxton's life. He was up with Quinnox and General

Braze, galloping well in front of the yelling troop.

These mounted carbineers, riding as Bedouins, swept

like thunder down the street, whirled into the broad,

open arena beyond the Duke's palace, and were upon

the surprised ruffians before they were fully awake to

the situation.
They came tumbling out of barns and sheds, clutching

their rifles in nerveless hands, aghast in the face of

absolute destruction. It was all over with the first dash

of the dragoons. The enemy, craven at the outset,

threw down their guns and tried to escape through the

alleys and side streets at the end of the common. Firing

all the time, the attacking force rode them down as if

they were so many dogs. The few who stood their

ground and fought valiantly were overpowered and

made captive by Quinnox. Less than a hundred men

were found in the camp. Instead of retreating immediately

to the Castle, Quinnox, acting on the suggestion

of the exhilarated King, kept up a fierce, deceptive

fire for the benefit of the distant Marlanx.
After ten or fifteen minutes of this desultory carnage,

it was reported that a large force of men were entering

the avenue from Regengetz Circus. Quinnox sent his

chargers toward this great horde of foot-soldiers, but

they did not falter as he had expected. On they swept,

two or three thousand of them. At their head rode

five or six officers. The foremost was Count Marlanx.
The cannons were booming now in the foothills.

Marlanx, if he heard them and realised what the bombardment

meant, did not swerve from the purpose at

present in his mind.
Quinnox saw now that the Iron Count was determined

to storm the gates, and gave the command to retreat.

Waving their rifles and shouting defiance over their

shoulders, the dragoons drew up, wheeled and galloped

toward the gates.
Truxton King afterward recalled to mind certain huge

piles of fresh earth in a corner of the common. He did

not know what they meant at the time of observation,

but he was wiser inside of three minutes after the whirlwind

brigade dashed through the gates.
Scarcely were the massive portals closed and the great

steel bars dropped into place by the men who attended

them, when a low, dull explosion shook the earth as if

by volcanic force. Then came the crashing of timbers,

the cracking of masonry, the whirring of a thousand

missiles through the air. Before the very eyes of the

stunned, bewildered defenders, dismounting near the

parade ground, the huge gates and pillars fell to the

ground.
The gates have been dynamited!
Then it was that Truxton King remembered. Marlanx's

sappers had been quietly at work for days, drilling

from the common to the gates. It was a strange

coincidence that Marlanx should have chosen this day

for his culminating assault on the Castle. The skirmish

at daybreak had hurried his arrangements, no doubt,

but none the less were his plans complete. The explosives

had been laid during the night; the fuses

reached to the mouth of the tunnel, across the common.

As he swept up the avenue at the head of his command,

hawk-faced and with glittering eyes, he snarled the

command that put fire to the fuses. He was still a

quarter of a mile away when the gates crumbled. With

short, shrill cries, scarcely human in their viciousness,

he urged his men forward. He and Brutus were the

first to ride up to the great hole that yawned where the

gates had stood. Beyond they could see the distracted

soldiers of the Prince forming in line to resist attack.
A moment later his vanguard streamed through the

aperture and faced the deadly fire from the driveway.
Like a stone wall the men under Quinnox stood their

ground; a solid, defiant line that fired with telling accuracy

into the struggling horde. On the walls two

Gatling guns began to cackle their laugh of death.

And still the mercenaries poured through the gap, forming

in haphazard lines under the direction of the maddened

Iron Count.
At last they began to advance across the grassy

meadow. When one man fell under the fire of the

Guardsmen, another rushed into his place. Three

times the indomitable Graustarkians drove them back,

and as often did Marlanx drag them up again, exalted

by the example he set.
"'Gad, he is a soldier," cried Truxton, who had wasted

a half dozen shots in the effort to bring him down.

"Hello! There's my friend Brutus. He's no coward,

either. Here's a try for you, Brutus."
He dropped to his knee and took deliberate aim at the

frenzied henchman. The discovery that there were three

bullets in Brutus's breast when he was picked up long

afterward did not affect the young man's contention

that his was the one that had found the heart.
The fall of Brutus urged the Iron Count to greater

fury. His horse had been shot from under him. He

was on his feet, a gaunt demon, his back to the enemy,

calling to his men to follow him as he moved toward

the stubborn row of green and red. Bullets hissed about

his ears, but he gave no heed to them. More than one

man in the opposing force watched him as if fascinated.

He seemed to be absolutely bullet-proof. There were

times when he stumbled and almost fell over the bodies

of his own men lying in the path.
By this time his entire force was inside the grounds.

Colonel Quinnox was quick to see the spreading movement

on the extreme right and left. Marlanx's captains

were trained warriors. They were bent on flanking

the enemy. The commander of the Guard gave the

command to fall back slowly toward the Castle.
Firing at every step, they crossed the parade ground

and then made a quick dash for the shelter of the long

balconies. They held this position for nearly an hour,

resisting each succeeding charge of the now devilish

foe. Time and again the foremost of the attacking

party reached the terrace, only to wither under the

deadly fire from behind the balustrades. Marlanx,

down in the parade ground, was fairly pushing his men

into the jaws of death. There was no question as to the

courage of the men he commanded. These were not the

ruffians from all over the world. They were the reckless,

devil-may-care mountaineers and robbers from the

hills of Graustark itself.
Truxton King's chance to pay his debt to Vos Engo

came after one of the fiercest, most determined charges.

The young Count, who had transferred his charges

from the old tower to the strong north wing of the

Castle, had been fighting desperately in the front rank

for some time. His weakness seemed to have disappeared

entirely. As the foe fell back in the face of

the desperate resistance, Vos Engo sprang down the

steps and rushed after them, calling others to join him

in the attempt to complete the rout. Near the edge of

the terrace he stopped. His leg gave way under him

and he fell to the ground. Truxton saw him fall.
He leaped over the low balustrade, dropping his hot

rifle, and dashed across the terrace to his rival's

assistance. A hundred men shot at him. Vos Engo was

trying to get to his feet, his hand upon his thigh; he

was groaning with pain.
"It's my turn," shouted the American. "I'll square

it up if I can. Then we're even!"
He seized the wounded man in his strong arms, threw

him over his shoulder and staggered toward the steps.
"Release me, damn you!" shrieked Vos Engo, striking

his rescuer in the face with his fist.
"I'm saving you for another day," said King as he

dropped behind the balustrade, with his burden safe.

A wild cheer went up from the lips of the defenders,

scornful howls from the enemy.
"I pray God it may be deferred until I am capable of

defending myself," groaned Vos Engo, glaring at the

other with implacable hatred in his eyes.
"You might pray for my preservation, too, while

you're at it," said Truxton, as he crept away to regain

his rifle.
There were other witnesses to Truxton's rash act. In

a lofty window of the north wing crouched a white-

faced girl and a grim old man. The latter held a rifle

in his tense though feeble hands. They had been there

for ten minutes or longer, watching the battle from

their eerie place of security. Now and then the old

man would sight his rifle and fire. A groan of anger

and dismay escaped his lips after each attempt to send

his bullet to the spot intended. The girl who crouched

beside him was there to designate a certain figure in the

ever-changing mass of humanity on the bloody parade

ground. Her clear eyes sought for and found Marlanx;

her unwavering finger pointed him out to the old marksman.
She saw Vos Engo fall. Then a tall, well-known figure

sprang into view, dashing toward her wounded lover.

Her heart stopped beating. The blood rushed to her

eyes. Everything before her turned red—a horrid,

blurring red. With her hands to her temples, she leaned

far over the window ledge and screamed—screamed

words that would have filled Truxton King with an endless

joy could he have heard them above the rattle of

the rifles.
"A brave act!" exclaimed the old man at her side.

"Who is he?"
But she did not hear him. She had fallen back and was

gasping supplication, her eyes set upon the old man's

face with a stare that meant nothing.
The corner of the building had shut out the picture;

it was impossible for her to know that the man and his

burden had reached the balcony in safety. Even now,

they might be lying on the terrace, riddled by bullets.

The concentrated aim of the enemy had not escaped

her horrified gaze. The cheering did not reach her ears.
The old man roused her from the stupor of dread. He

called her name several times in high, strident tones.

Dully she responded. Standing bolt upright in the

window she sought out the figure of Marlanx, and

pointed rigidly.
"Ah," groaned the old man, "they will not be driven

back this time! They will not be denied. It is the last

charge! God, how they come! Our men will be annihilated

in—Where is he? Now! Ah, I see! Yes,

that is he! He is near enough now. I cannot miss

him!"
Marlanx was leading his men up to the terrace. A

howling avalanche of humanity, half obscured by

smoke, streamed up the slope.
At the top of the terrace, the Iron Count suddenly

stopped. His long body stiffened and then crumpled

like a reed. A score of heavy feet trampled on the

fallen leader, but he did not feel the impact.
A bullet from the north wing had crashed into his

brain.
"At last!" shrieked the old man at the window. "Come,

Miss Tullis; my work is done."
"He is dead, your Grace?" in low, awed tones.
"Yes, my dear," said the Duke of Perse, a smile of

relief on his face. "Come, let me escort you to the

Prince. You have been most courageous. Graustark

shall not forget it. Nor shall I ever cease thanking

you for the service you have rendered to me. I have

succeeded in freeing my unhappy daughter from the

vile beast to whom I sold her youth and beauty and

purity. Come! You must not look upon that carnage!"
Together they left the little room. As they stepped

into the narrow hall beyond they realised that the defenders

had been driven inside the walls of the Castle.

The crash of firearms filled the halls far below; a

deafening, steady roar came up to them.
"It is all over," said the Duke of Perse, hobbling across

the hall and throwing open the door to a room opposite.
A group of terrified women were huddled in the far

corner of the spacious room. In front of them was the

little Prince, a look of terror in his eyes, but with the

tiny sword clutched in his hand—a pathetic figure of

courage and dread combined. The Duke of Perse held

open the door for Loraine Tullis, but she did not enter.

When he turned to call, she was half way down the top

flight of stairs, racing through the powder smoke toward

the landing below.
At every step she was screaming in the very agony of

gladness:
"Stand firm! Hold them! Help is coming! Help

is coming!"
A last look through the window at the end of the hail

had revealed to her the most glorious of visions.
Red and green troops were pouring through the dismantled

gateway, their horses surging over the ugly

ground-rifts and debris as if possessed of the fabled

wings.
She had seen the rear line in the storming forces

hesitate and then turn to meet the whirlwind charge

of the cavalrymen. Her brother was out there and all

was well. She was crying the joyous news from the

head of the grand stairway when Truxton King caught

sight of her.
Smoke writhed about her slim, inspiriting figure. Her

face shone through the drab fog like an undimmed star

of purest light. He bounded up the steps toward her,

drawn as by magnet against which there was no such

thing as resistance.
He was powder-stained and grimy; there was blood

on his face and shirt front.
"You are shot," she cried, clutching the post at the

bend in the stairs. "Truxton! Truxton!"
"Not even scratched," he shouted, as he reached her

side. "It's not my—" He stopped short, even as he

held out his arms to clasp her to his breast. "It's some

one else's blood," he finished resolutely. She swayed

toward him and he caught her in his arms.
"I love you—oh, I love you, Truxton!" she cried over

and over again. He was faint with joy. His kisses

spoke the adoration he would have cried out to her if

emotion had not clogged his throat.
"Eric?" she whispered at last, drawing back in his

arms and looking up into his eyes with a great pity in

her own. "Is he—is he dead, Truxton?"
"No," he said gently. "Badly hurt, but—"
"He will not die? Thank God, Truxton. He is a

brave—oh, a very brave man." Then she remembered

her mission into this whirlpool of danger. "Go! Don't

lose a moment, darling! Tell Colonel Quinnox that

Jack has come! The dragoons are—"
He did not hear the end of her cry. A quick, fierce

kiss and he was gone, bounding down the stairs with

great shouts of encouragement.
Leaderless, between the deadly fires, the mercenaries

gave up the fight after a brief stand at the terrace.

Six hundred horsemen ploughed through them, driving

them to the very walls of the Castle. Here they broke

and scattered, throwing down their arms and shouting

for mercy. It was all over inside of twenty minutes.
The Prince reigned again.

Nightfall brought complete restoration of order,

peace and security in the city of Edelweiss. Hundreds

of lives had been lost in the terrific conflict of the early

morning hours; hundreds of men lay on beds of suffering,

crushed and bleeding from the wounds they had

courted and received.
"I knowed we'd whip them," shouted the Prince, wriggling

gleefully in John Tullis's straining embrace half

an hour after the latter had ridden through the gate.

Tears streamed down the big man's face. One arm

held the boy, the other encircled the sister he had all

but lost. In the Monastery of St. Valentine there was

another woman, waiting for him to come to her with

the news of a glorious victory. Perhaps she was hoping

and praying for the other news that he would bring her,

who knows? If he came to her with kisses, she would

know without being told in so many words.
Truxton did not again see Loraine until late in the

afternoon. He had offered his services to Colonel

Quinnox and had worked manfully in the effort to

provide comfort for the wounded of both sides. General

Braze was at work with his men in the open city, clearing

away the ugly signs of battle. The fortress and

Tower were full of the prisoners of war. Baron

Dangloss, pale, emaciated, sick but resolute, was free

once more and, with indomitable zeal, had thrown himself

and his liberated men at once into the work of rehabilitation.
It was on the occasion of the Baron's first visit to the

Prince, late in the day, that Truxton saw the girl he

worshipped.
Prince Robin had sent for him to appear in the devastated

state chamber. Publicly, in the presence of

the Court and Ministry, the little ruler proclaimed him

a baron and presented to him a great seal ring from

among the ancient crown jewels.
"Say, Mr. King," said Bobby, after he had called the

American quite close to him by means of a stealthy

crooking of his finger, "would you mind giving me my

lucky stone? I don't think you'll need it any longer.

I will, I'm sure. You see a prince has such a lot of

things to trouble him. Wars and murders and everything."
"Thank you, Prince Robin," said King, placing the

stone in the little hand. "I couldn't have got on without

it. May it always serve you as well."
"Noblesse oblige, Baron," said Prince Robin gravely.
"Hello!" in an excited whisper. "Here's Baron

Dangloss. He's been in his own gaol!"
Truxton withdrew. Near the door he met Loraine.

She had just entered the room. There was a bright

look of relief in her eyes.
"Count Vos Engo has asked for you, Truxton," she

said in a low voice. A delicate flush crept into her

cheeks; a sudden shyness leaped into her eyes, and she

looked away.
"Loraine, have you told him?"
"Yes. I am so sorry for him. He is one of the

bravest men I have ever known, Truxton dear. And,

as it is with all men of his race, love knew no reason,

no compromise. But I have made him see that I—that I

cannot be his wife. He knows that I love you."
"Somehow, darling, I'm sorry for him."
"He will not pretend friendship for you, dear," she

went on painfully. "He only wants to thank you and

to apologise, as you did, not so long ago. And he

wants to ask you to release him from a certain obligation."
"You mean our—our fight?"
"Yes. He is to lose his right arm, Truxton. You

understand how it is with him now."

CHAPTER XXIII
"YOU WILL BE MRS. KING"
Late that night it was reported at the Castle that a

large force of men were encamped on the opposite side

of the river. A hundred camp-fires were gleaming

against the distant uplands.
"The Grand Duke Paulus!" exclaimed Count Halfont.

"Thank God, he did not come a day earlier. We owe

him nothing to-day—but yesterday! Ah, he could have

demanded much of us. Send his messengers to me,

Colonel Quinnox, as soon as they arrive in the morning.

I will arise early. There is much to do in Graustark.

Let there be no sluggards."
A mellow, smiling moon crept up over the hills, flooding

the laud with a serene radiance. Once more the

windows in the Castle gleamed brightly; low-voiced

people strolled through the shattered balconies; others

wandered about the vast halls, possessed by uncertain

emotions, torn by the conflicting hands of joy and

gloom. In a score of rooms wounded men were lying; in

others there were dead heroes. At the barracks, standing

dully against the distant shadows, there were many

cots of suffering. And yet there was rejoicing, even

among those who writhed in pain or bowed their heads

in grief. Victory's wings were fanning the gloom away;

conquest was painting an ever-widening streak of

brightness across the dark, drear canvas of despair.
In one of the wrecked approaches to the terrace,

surrounded by fragments of stone and confronted by

ugly destruction, sat a young man and a slender girl.

There were no lights near them; the shadows were black

and forbidding. This particular end of the terrace

had suffered most in the fierce rain of cannon-balls.

So great was the devastation here that one attained the

position held by the couple only by means of no little

daring and at the risk of unkind falls. From where

they sat they could see the long vista of lighted windows

and yet could not themselves be seen.
His arm was about her; her head nestled securely

against his shoulder and her slim hands were willing

prisoners in one of his.
She was saying "Truxton, dear, I did not love Eric

Vos Engo. I just thought it was love. I never really

knew what love is until you came into my life. Then I

knew the difference. That's what made it so hard. I

had let him believe that I might care for him some day.

And I did like him. So I—"
"You are sure—terribly sure—that I am the only man

you ever really loved?" he interrupted.
She snuggled closer. "Haven't I just told you that I

didn't know what it was until—well, until now?"
"You will never, never know how happy I am,

Loraine!" he breathed into her ear.
"I hope I shall always bring happiness to you, Truxton,"

she murmured, faint with the joy of loving.
"You will make me very unhappy if you don't marry

me to-morrow."
"I couldn't think of it!"
"I don't ask you to think. If you do, you may

change your mind completely. Just marry me without

thinking, dearest."
"I will marry you, Truxton, when we get to New

York," she said, but not very firmly. He saw his advantage.
"But, my dear, I'm tired of travelling."
It was rather enigmatic. "What has that to do with

it?" she asked.
"Well, it's this way: if we get married in New York

we'll have to consider an extended and wholly obligatory

wedding journey. If we get married here, we can save

all that bother by bridal-tripping to New York, instead

of away from it. And, what's more, we'll escape the

rice-throwing and the old shoes and the hand-painted

trunk labels. Greater still: we will avoid a long and

lonely trip across the ocean on separate steamers. That's

something, you know."
"We could go on the same steamer."
"Quite so, my dear. But don't you think it would be

nicer if we went as one instead of two?"
"I suppose it would be cheaper."
"They say a fellow saves money by getting married."
"I hate a man who is always trying to save money."
"Well, if you put it that way, I'll promise never to

save a cent. I'm a horrible spendthrift."
"Oh, you'll have to save, Truxton!"
"How silly we are!" he cried in utter joyousness. He

held her close for a long time, his face buried in her

hair. "Listen, darling: won't you say you'll be my

wife before I leave Graustark? I want you so much.

I can't go away without you."
She hesitated. "When are you going, Truxton? You—you

haven't told me."
It was what he wanted. "I am going next Monday,"

he said promptly. As a matter of fact, he had forgotten

the day of the week they were now living in.
"Monday? Oh, dear!"
"Will you?"
"I—I must cable home first," she faltered.
"That's a mere detail, darling. Cable afterward. It

will beat us home by three weeks. They'll know we're

coming."
"I must ask John, really I must, Truxton," she protested

faintly.
"Hurray!" he shouted—in a whisper. "He is so

desperately in love, he won't think of refusing anything

we ask. Shall we set it for Saturday?"
They set it for Saturday without consulting John

Tullis, and then fell to discussing him. "He is very

much in love with her," she said wistfully.
"And she loves him, Loraine. They will be very happy.

She's wonderful."
"Well, so is John. He's the most wonderful man in

all this world."
"I am sure of it," he agreed magnanimously. "I saw

him talking with her and the Duke of Perse as I came

out awhile ago. They were going to the Duke's rooms

up there. The Duke will offer no objections. I think

he'll permit his daughter to select his next son-in-law."
"How could he have given her to that terrible, terrible

old man?" she cried, with a shudder.
"She won't be in mourning for him long, I fancy.

Nobody will talk of appearances, either. She could

marry Jack to-morrow and no one would criticise her."
"Oh, that would be disgusting, Truxton!"
"But, my dear, he isn't to have a funeral, so why not?

They buried his body in quicklime this afternoon. No

mourners, no friends, no tears! Hang it all, she's

foolish if she puts on anything but red."
"They can't be married for—oh, ever so long," she

said very primly.
"No, indeed," he said with alacrity. But he did not

believe what he said. If he knew anything about John

Tullis, it would not be "ever so long" before Prince

Robin's friend turned Benedict and husband to the most

noted beauty in all Graustark.
"I shall be sorry to leave Graustark," she said dreamily,

after a long period of silent retrospection. "I've

had the happiest year of my life here."
"I've had the busiest month of my life here. I'll never

again say that the world is a dull place. And I'll

never advise any man to go out of his own home city

in search of the most adorable woman in the world. She's

always there, bless her heart, if he'll only look around

a bit for her."
"But you wouldn't have found me if you hadn't come

to Graustark."
"I shudder when I think of what might have happened

to you, my Princess Sweetheart, if I hadn't come to

Edelweiss. No; I would not have found you." Feeling

her tremble in his arms, he went on with whimsical good

humour: "You would have been eaten up by the ogre

long before this. Or, perhaps, you would have succeeded

in becoming a countess."
"As it is, I shall be a baroness."
"In Graustark, but not in New York. That reminds

me. You'll be more than a baroness—more than a

princess. You will be a queen. Don't you catch the

point? You will be Mrs. King."

The Grand Duke Paulus was distinctly annoyed. He

had travelled many miles, endured quite a number of

hardships, and all to no purpose. When dawn came,

his emissaries returned from the city with the lamentable

information that the government had righted itself,

that Marlanx's sensational revolution was at an

end, and that the regents would be highly honoured if

his Excellency could overlook the distressingly chaotic

conditions at court and condescend to pay the Castle a

visit. The regents, the Prince and the citizens of Graustark

desired the opportunity to express their gratitude

for the manner in which he had voluntarily (and unexpectedly)

come to their assistance in time of trouble.

The fact that he had come too late to render the invaluable

aid he so nobly intended did not in the least

minimise the volume of gratefulness they felt.
The Grand Duke admitted that he was at sea, diplomatically.

He was a fifth wheel, so to speak, now that

the revolution was over. Not so much as the tip of

his finger had he been able to get into the coveted pie.

There was nothing for him to do but to turn round with

his five thousand Cossacks and march disconsolately

across the steppes to an Imperial railroad, where he

could embark for home. However, he would visit the

Castle in a very informal way, extend his congratulations,

offer his services—which he knew would be declined

with thanks—and profess his unbounded joy in

the discovery that Graustark happily was so able to

take care of herself. Incidentally, he would mention

the bond issue; also, he would find the opportunity to

suggest to the ministry that his government still was

willing to make large grants and stupendous promises

if any sort of an arrangement could be made by which

the system might be operated in conjunction with

branch lines of the Imperial roads.
And so it was that at noon he rode in pomp and

splendour through the city gates, attended by his staff

and a rather overpowering body-guard. His excuse

for the early call was delicately worded. He said in

his reply to the message from the Count that it would

give him great pleasure to remain for some time at the

Castle, were it not for the fact that he had left his own

province in a serious state of unrest; it was imperative

that he should return in advance of the ever-possible

and always popular uprising. Therefore he would pay

his respects to his serene Highness, renew his protestations

of friendship, extend his felicitations, and beg

leave to depart for his own land without delay.
As he rode from Regengetz Circus into Castle Avenue,

a small knot of American tourists crowded to the curb

and bent eager, attentive ears to the words of a stubby

little person whom we should recognise by his accent;

but, for fear that there may be some who have forgotten

him in the rush of events, we will point to his

cap and read aloud: "Cook's Interpreter."
Mr. Hobbs was saying: "The gentleman on the gray

horse, ladies and gentlemen, is his Highness, the Grand

Duke Paulus. He has come to pay his respects to his

Serene Highness. Now, if you will kindly step this

way, I will show you the spot where the bomb was

thrown. 'Aving been an eye-witness to the shocking

occurrence, I respectfully submit that I," etc. With

a pride and dignity that surpassed all moderate sense

of appreciation, he delivered newly made history unto

his charges, modestly winding up his discourse with the

casual remark that the Prince had but recently appointed

him twelfth assistant steward at the Castle,

and that he expected to assume the duties of this

honorary position just as soon as Cook & Sons could

find a capable man to send up in his place.
The American tourists, it may be well to observe, arrived

by the first train that entered the city from the

outside world.
The audience was at two o'clock. Prince Robin was

in a state of tremendous excitement. Never before had

he been called upon to receive a grand duke. He quite

forgot yesterday's battle in the face of this most imposing

calamity. More than that, he was in no frame

of mind to enjoy the excitement attending the rehabilitation

of the Castle; oppressed by the approaching

shadow of the great man, he lost all interest in what was

going on in the Castle, about the grounds and among

his courtiers.
"What'll I do, Uncle Jack, if he asks any questions?"

he mourned. They were dressing him in the robes of

state.
"Answer 'em," said his best friend.
"But supposin' I can't? Then what?"
"He won't ask questions, Bobby. People never

do when a potentate is on his throne. It's shockingly

bad form."
"I hope he won't stay long," prayed Bobby, a grave

pucker between his brows. He was a very tired little

boy. His eyes were heavy with sleep and his lips were

not very firm.
"Count Halfont will look after him, Bobby; so don't

worry. Just sit up there on the throne and look wise.

The regents will do the rest. Watch your Uncle Caspar.

When he gives the signal, you arise. That ends the

audience. You walk out—"
"I know all about that, Uncle Jack. But I bet I do

something wrong. This thing of receiving grand

dukes is no joke. 'Specially when we're so terribly upset.

Really, I ought to be looking after the men who

are wounded, attending to the funerals of—"
"Now, Bobby, don't flunk like that! Be a man!"
Bobby promptly squared his little shoulders and set

his jaw. "Oh, I'm not scared!" He was thoughtful

for a moment. "But, I'll tell you, it's awful lonesome

up in that big chair, so far away from all your friends.

I wish Uncle Caspar would let me sit down with the

crowd."
The Grand Duke, with all the arrogance of a real

personage, was late. It was not for him to consider the

conditions that distressed the Court of Graustark. Not

at all. He was a grand duke and he would take his

own time in paying his respects. What cared he that

every one in the Castle was tired and unstrung and sad

and—sleepy? Any one but a grand duke would have

waited a day or two before requiring a royal audience.

When he finally presented himself at the Castle doors,

a sleepy group of attendants actually yawned in his

presence.
A somnolent atmosphere, still touched by the smell of

gunpowder, greeted him as he strode majestically down

the halls. Somehow each person who bowed to him

seemed to do it with the melancholy precision of one

who has been up for six nights in succession and doesn't

care who knows it.
No one had slept during the night just passed. Excitement

and the suffering of others had denied slumber

to one and all—even to those who had not slept for

many days and nights. Now the reaction was upon

them. Relaxation had succeeded tenseness.
When the Grand Duke entered the great, sombre

throne room, he was confronted by a punctiliously

polite assemblage, but every eyelid was as heavy as lead

and as prone to sink.
The Prince sat far back in the great chair of his

ancestors, his sturdy legs sticking straight out in front

of him, utterly lost in the depths of gold and royal

velvet. Two-score or more of his courtiers and as

many noble ladies of the realm stood soberly in the

places assigned them by the laws of precedence. The

Grand Duke advanced between the respectful lines and

knelt at the foot of the throne.
"Arise, your Highness," piped Bobby, with a quick

glance at Count Halfont. It was a very faint, faraway

voice that uttered the gracious command. "Graustark

welcomes the Grand Duke Paulus. It is my pleasure to—to—to—"

a helpless look came into his eyes. He

looked everywhere for support. The Grand Duke saw

that he had forgotten the rehearsed speech, and smiled

benignly as he stepped forward and kissed the hand that

had been extended somewhat uncertainly.
"My most respectful homage to your Majesty. The

felicitations of my emperor and the warmest protestations

of friendship from his people."
With this as a prologue, he engaged himself in the

ever-pleasurable task of delivering a long, congratulatory

address. If there was one thing above another that

the Grand Duke enjoyed, it was the making of a speech.

He prided himself on his prowess as an orator and as an

after-dinner speaker; but, more than either of these,

he gloried in his ability to soar extemporaneously.
For ten minutes he addressed himself to the throne,

benignly, comfortably. Then he condescended to devote

a share of his precious store to the courtiers behind

him. If he caught more than one of them yawning

when he turned in their direction, he did not permit

it to disturb him in the least. His eyes may have narrowed

a bit, but that was all.
After five minutes of high-sounding platitudes, he

again turned to the Prince. It was then that he received

his first shock.


"His Majesty appears to have—ahem—gone to sleep,"

remarked the Grand Duke tartly"


Prince Robin was sound asleep. His head was slipping

side-wise along the satiny back of the big chair, and

his chin was very low in the laces at his neck. The

Grand Duke coughed emphatically, cleared his throat,

and grew very red in the face.
The Court of Graustark was distinctly dismayed.

Here was shocking state of affairs. The prince

going to sleep while a grand duke talked!
"His Majesty appears to have—ahem—gone to sleep,"

remarked the Grand Duke tartly, interrupting himself

to address the Prime Minister.
"He is very tired, your Excellency," said Count

Halfont, very much distressed. "Pray consider what

he has been through during the—"
"Ah, my dear Count, do not apologise for him. I

quite understand. Ahem! Ahem!" Still he was very

red in the face. Some one had laughed softly behind

his back.
"I will awaken him, your Excellency," said the Prime

Minister, edging toward the throne.
"Not at all, sir!" protested the visitor. "Permit him

to have his sleep out, sir. I will not have him disturbed.

Who am I that I should defeat the claims of nature? It

is my pleasure to wait until his Majesty's nap is over.

Then he may dismiss us, but not until we have cried:

'Long live the Prince!'"
For awhile they stood in awkward silence, this notable

gathering of men and women. Then the Prime Minister,

in hushed tones, suggested that it would be eminently

proper, under the circumstances, for all present to be

seated. He was under the impression that His Serene

Highness would sleep long and soundly.
Stiff-backed and uncomfortable, the Court sat and

waited. No one pretended to conceal the blissful yawns

that would not be denied. A drowsy, ineffably languid

feeling took possession of the entire assemblage. Here

and there a noble head nodded slightly; eyelids fell in

the silent war against the god of slumber, only to

revive again with painful energy and ever-weakening

courage.
The Prime Minister sat at the foot of the throne and

nodded in spite of himself. The Minister of the

Treasury was breathing so heavily that his neighbor

nudged him just in time to prevent something even more

humiliating. John Tullis, far back near the wall, had

his head on his hand, bravely fighting off the persistent

demon. Prince Dantan of Dawsbergen was sound

asleep.
The Grand Duke was wide awake. He saw it all and

was equal to the occasion. After all, he was a kindly

old gentleman, and, once his moment of mortification

was over, he was not above charity.
Bobby's poor little head had slipped over to a most

uncomfortable position against the arm of the chair.

Putting his finger to his lips, the Grand Duke tip-toed

carefully up to the throne. With very gentle hands he

lifted Bobby's head, and, infinitely tender, stuffed a

throne cushion behind the curly head. Still with his

finger to his lips, a splendid smile in his eyes, he tip-toed

back to his chair.
As he passed Count Halfont, who had risen, he

whispered:
"Dear little man! I do not forget, my lord, that I

was once a boy. God bless him!"
Then he sat down, conscious of a fine feeling of goodness,

folded his arms across his expansive chest, and

allowed his beaming eyes to rest upon the sleeping boy

far back in the chair of state. Incidentally, he decided

to delay a few days before taking up the bond question

with the ministry. The Grand Duke was not an ordinary

diplomat.
In one of the curtained windows, far removed from the

throne, sat Truxton King and Loraine Tullis.
All about them people were watching the delicate little

scene, smiling drowsily at the Grand Duke's tender

comedy. No one was looking at the two in the curtained

recess. Her hand was in his, her head sank slowly

toward his inviting shoulder; her heavy lids drooped

lower and lower, refusing to obey the slender will that

argued against complete surrender. At last her soft,

regular breathing told him that she was asleep. Awaiting

his opportunity, he tenderly kissed the soft, brown

hair, murmured a gentle word of love, and settled his

own head against the thick cushions.
Everywhere they dozed and nodded. The Grand Duke

smiled and blinked his little eyes. He was very wide

awake.
That is how he happened to see the Prince move restlessly

and half open his sleep-bound eyes. The Grand

Duke leaned forward with his hand to his ear, and

listened. He had seen the boy's lips move. From

dreamland came Bobby's belated:
"Good-ni—ight."
