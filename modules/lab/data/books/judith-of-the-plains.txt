“Town”


It was June, and a little past sunrise, but there was no hint of early summer

freshness in the noxious air of the sleeping-car as it toiled like a snail over

the infinity of prairie. From behind the green-striped curtains of the berths,

now the sound of restless turning and now a long-drawn sigh signified the

uneasy slumber due to stifling air and discomfort.


The only passenger stirring was a girl whose youth drooped under the

unfavorable influences of foul air, fatigue, and a strained anxiety to come to

the end of this fateful journey. She had been up while it was yet dark, and her

hand—luggage, locked, strapped, and as pitifully new at the art of

travelling as the girl herself, clustered about the hem of her blue serge skirt

like chicks about a hen. The engine shrieked, but its voice sounded weak and

far off in that still ocean of space; the girl tightened her grasp on the

largest of the satchels and looked at the approaching porter tentatively.


“We’re late twenty-fi’e minutes,” he reassured her,

with the hopeless patience of one who has lost heart in curbing

travellers’ enthusiasms.


She turned towards the window a pair of shoulders plainly significant of the

burdensome last straw.


“Four days and nights in this train”—they were slower in

those days—“and now this extra twenty-five minutes!”


Miss Carmichael’s famous dimple hid itself in disgust. The demure lines

of mouth and chin, that could always be relied upon for special pleading when

sentence was about to be passed on the dimple by those who disapproved of

dimples, drooped with disappointment. But the light-brown hair continued to

curl facetiously—it was the sort of hair whose spontaneous rippling

conveys to the seeing eye a sense of humor.


The train plodded across the spacious vacancy that unrolled itself farther and

farther in quest of the fugitive horizon. The scrap of view that came within a

closer range of vision spun past the car windows like a bit of stage mechanism,

a gigantic panorama rotating to simulate a race at breakneck speed. But Miss

Carmichael looked with unseeing eyes; the whirling prairie with its golden

flecks of cactus bloom was but part of the universal strangeness, and the dull

ache of homesickness was in it all.


“My dear! my dear!”—a head in crimpers was thrust from

between the curtains of the section opposite—“I’ve been awake

half the night. I was so afraid I wouldn’t see you before you got

off.”


The head was followed, almost instinctively, by a hand travelling furtively to

the crimpers that gripped the lady’s brow like barnacles clinging to a

keel.


Mary expressed a grieved appreciation at the loss of rest in behalf of her

early departure, and conspicuously forbore to glance in the direction of the

barnacles, that being a first principle as between woman and woman.


“And, oh, my dear, it gets worse and worse. I’ve looked at it this

morning, and it’s worse in Wyoming than it was in Colorado. What it

’ll be before I reach California, I shudder to think.”


“It’s bound to improve,” suggested Mary, with the easy

optimism of one who was leaving it. “It couldn’t be any worse than

this, could it?”


The neuter pronoun, it might be well to state, signified the prairie; its

melancholy personality having penetrated the very marrow of their train

existence, they had come to refer to it by the monosyllable, as in certain

nether circles the head of the house receives his superlative distinction in

“He.”


Again the locomotive shrieked, again the girl mechanically clutched the

suit-case, as presenting the most difficult item in the problem of

transportation, and this time the shriek was not an idle formality. The train

slowed down; the uneasy sleepers behind the green-striped curtains stirred

restlessly with the lessening motion of their uncouth cradle. The porter came

to help her, with the chastened mien of one whose hopes of largess are small,

the lady with the barnacles called after her redundant farewells, and a moment

later Miss Carmichael was standing on the station platform looking helplessly

after the train that toiled and puffed, yet seemed, in that crystalline

atmosphere, still within arm’s-reach. She watched it till its floating

pennant of smoke was nothing but a gray feather blowing farther and farther out

of sight on the flat prairie.


The town—it would be unkind to mention its name—had made merry the

night before at the comprehensive invitation of a sheepman who had just

disposed of his wool-clip, and who said, by way of general summons,

“What’s the use of temptin’ the bank?”

“Town,” therefore, when Mary Carmichael first made its

acquaintance, was still sleeping the sleep of the unjust. Those among last

night’s roisterers who had had to make an early start for their camps

were well into the foot-hills by this time, and would remember with

exhilaration the cracked tinkle of the dance-hall piano as inspiring music when

the lonesomeness of the desert menaced and the young blood again clamored for

its own.


“Town”—it contained in all some two dozen buildings—was

very unlovely in slumber. It sprawled in the lap of the prairies, a grimy-faced

urchin, with the lines of dismal sophistication writ deep. Yet where in all the

“health resorts” of the East did air sweep from the clean

hill-country with such revivifying power? It seemed a glad world of abiding

youth. Surely “Town” was but a dreary illusion, a mirage that hung

in the unmapped spaces of this new world that God had made and called good; an

omen of the abominations that men would make when they grew blind to the beauty

of God’s world.


Mary Carmichael, with much the feelings of a cat in a strange garret, wandered

about the sluggard town; and presently the blue-and-white sign of a telegraph

office, with the mythological figure of a hastening messenger, suggested to her

that a reassuring telegram was only Aunt Adelaide’s due. Whereupon she

began to rap on the door of the office, a scared pianissimo which naturally had

little effect on the operator, who was at home and asleep some three blocks

distant. But the West is the place for woman if she would be waited upon. No

seven-to-one ratio of the sexes has tempered the chivalry of her sons of the

saddle. A loitering something in a sombrero saw rather than heard the rapping,

and, at the sight, went in quest of the dreaming operator without so much as

embarrassing Miss Carmichael with an offer of his services. And presently the

operator, whose official day did not begin for some two hours yet, appeared,

much dishevelled from running and the cursory nature of his toilet, prepared to

receive a message of life and death.


The wire to Aunt Adelaide ran:


“Practically at end of journey. Take stage to Lost Trail this morning. Am

well. Don’t worry about me.


“MARY.”


And the telegraph operator, dimly remembering that he had heard Lost Trail was

a “pizen mean country,” and that it was tucked some two hundred

miles back in the foot-hills, did not find it very hard to forgive the girl,

who was “practically at end of journey,” particularly as the dimple

had come out of hiding, and he had never been called upon to telegraph the word

“practically” before. He was a progressive man and liked to extend

his experiences.


After sending the telegram, Miss Carmichael, quite herself by reason of the

hill air, felt that she was getting along famously as a traveller, but that it

was an expensive business, and she was glad to be “practically” at

the end of her journey. And, drawing from her pocket a square envelope of heavy

Irish linen, a little worn from much reading, but primarily an envelope that

bespoke elegance of taste on the part of her correspondent, she read:


“LOST TRAIL, WYOMING.


“My Dear Miss Carmichael,—Pray let me assure you of my

gratification that the preliminaries have been so satisfactorily arranged, and

that we are to have you with us by the end of June. The children are profiting

from the very anticipation of it, and it will be most refreshing to all us

isolated ones to be able to welcome an Eastern girl as a member of our

family.

    “Although the long journey across the continent is trying,

particularly to one who has not made it before, I hope you may not find it

utterly fatiguing. Please remember that after leaving the train, it will be

necessary to take a stage to Lost Trail. If it is possible, I shall meet you

with the buckboard at one of the stage stations; otherwise, keep to the stage

route, being careful to change at Dax’s Ranch.

    “Unfortunately, the children vary so in their accomplishments that I

fear I can make no suggestions as to what you may need to bring with you in the

way of text-books. But I think you will find them fairly well grounded.

    “I had a charming letter from Mrs. Kirkland, who said the pleasantest

things possible of you. I am glad the wife of our Senator was able

conscientiously to commend us.

    “With our most cordial good wishes for a safe journey, believe me,

dear Miss Carmichael,


“Sincerely yours,

    “SARAH YELLETT.”


In the mean time, “Town” came yawning to breakfast. It was not so

prankish as it had been the night before, when it accepted the sheepman’s

broad-gauge hospitality and made merry till the sun winked from behind the

mountains. It made its way to the low, shedlike eating-house with a

pre-breakfast solemnity bordering on sulkiness. Not a petticoat was in sight to

offset the spurs and sombreros that filed into breakfast from every point in

the compass, prepared to eat primitively, joke broadly, and quarrel speedily if

that sensitive and often inconsistent something they called honor should be

brushed however lightly.


But the eternal feminine was within, and, discovering it, the temper of

“Town” was changed; it ate self-consciously, made jokes meet for

the ears of ladies, and was more interested in the girl in the sailor-hat than

it was in remembering old feuds or laying the foundations of new.


In its interior aspect, the eating-house conveyed no subtle invitation to eat,

drink, and be merry. On the contrary, its mission seemed to be that of

confounding appetite at every turn. A long, shedlike room it was, with walls of

unpainted pine, still sweating from the axe. Festoons of scalloped paper, in

conflicting shades, hung from the ceiling, a menace to the taller of the

guests. On the rough walls some one, either prompted by a latent spirit of

æstheticism or with an idea of abetting the town towards merrymaking—an

encouragement it hardly required—had tacked posters of shows, mainly

representing the tank-and-sawmill school of drama.


Miss Carmichael sat at the extreme end of the long, oilcloth-covered table, on

which a straggling army of salt and pepper shakers, catsup bottles, and divers

commercial condiments seemed to pause in a discouraged march. A plague of flies

was on everything, and the food was a threat to the hardiest appetite. One man

summed up the steak with, “You got to work your jaw so hard to eat it

that it ain’t fair to the next meal.”


His neighbor heaved a sigh. “This here formation, whatever it

be”—and he turned the meat over for better

inspection—“do shore remind me of an indestructible doll that an

old maid aunt of mine giv’ my sister when we was kids. That doll sort of

challenged me, settin’ round oncapable o’ bein’ destroyed,

and one day I ups an’ has a chaw at her. She war ondestructible, all

right; ’fore that I concluded my speriments I had left a couple o’

teeth in her.”


“Well, I discyards the steak and draw to a pair of aces,” and the

first man helped himself to a couple of biscuits.


Miss Carmichael knew, by the continual scraping of chairs across the gritty

floor, that the places at the table must be nearly all taken; and while she

anticipated, with an utterly unreasonable terror, any further invasion of her

seclusion at the end of the table, still she could not persuade herself to

raise her eyes to detect the progress of the enemy, even in the interest of the

diary she had kept so conscientiously for the past three days; which was

something of a loss to the diary, as those untamed, manly faces were well worth

looking at. Reckless they were in many instances, and sometimes the lines of

hardship were cruelly writ across young faces that had not yet lost the down of

adolescence, but there were humor and endurance and the courage that knows how

to make a crony of death and get right good sport from the comradeship. Their

faults were the faults of lusty, red-blooded youth, and their virtues the

open-handed generosity, the ready sympathy of those uncertain tilters at life

who ride or fall in the tourney of a new country.


At present, “the yearling,” drinking her execrable coffee in an

agony of embarrassment, weighed heavily on their minds. They would have liked

to rise as a man and ask if there was anything they could do for her. But as a

glance towards the end of the table seemed to increase her discomfiture

tenfold, they did the kindest and for them the most difficult thing and looked

in every direction but Miss Carmichael’s. With a delicacy of perception

that the casual observer might not have given them credit for, they had

refrained from taking seats directly opposite her, or those immediately on her

right, which, as she occupied the last seat at the table, gave her at least a

small degree of seclusion.


As one after another of them came filing in, bronzed, rugged, radiating a

beauty of youth and health that no sketchy exigence of apparel could obscure,

some one already seated at the table would put a foot on a chair opposite him

and send it spinning out into the middle of the floor as a hint to the

new-comer that that was his reserved seat. And the cow-puncher, sheep-herder,

prospector, or man about “Town,” as the case might be, would take

the hint and the chair, leaving the petticoat separated from the sombreros by a

table-land of oilcloth and a range of four chairs.


But now entered a man who failed to take the hint of the spinning chair. In

fact, he entered the eating-house with the air of one who has dropped in

casually to look for a friend and, incidentally, to eat his breakfast. He

stopped in the doorway, scanned the table with deliberation, and started to

make his way towards Mary Carmichael with something of a swagger. Some one

kicked a chair towards him at the head of the table. Some one else nearly upset

him with one before he reached the middle, and the Texan remarked, quite

audibly, as he passed:


“The damned razor-back!”


But the man made his way to the end of the table and drew out the chair

opposite Miss Carmichael with a degree of assurance that precipitated the rest

of the table into a pretty pother.


Suppose she should countenance his audacity? The fair have been known to

succumb to the headlong force of a charge, when the persistence of a long siege

has failed signally. What figures they would cut if she did!—and Simpson,

of all men! A growing tension had crept into the atmosphere of the

eating-house; knives and forks played but intermittently, and Mary, sitting at

the end of the oilcloth-covered table, felt intuitively that she was the centre

of the brewing storm. Oh, why hadn’t she been contented to stay at home

and make over her clothes and share the dwindling fortunes of her aunts,

instead of coming to this savage place?


“From the look of the yearling’s chin, I think he’ll get all

that’s coming to him,” whispered the man who had nearly upset him

with the second chair.


“You’re right, pard. If I’m any good at reading brands, she

is as self-protective as the McKinley bill.”


The man Simpson was not a pleasant vis-à-vis. He wore the same picturesque

ruffianliness of apparel as his fellows, but the resemblance stopped there. He

lacked their dusky bloom, their clearness of eye, the suppleness and easy flow

of muscle that is the hall-mark of these frontiersmen. He was fat and squat and

had not the rich bronzing of wind, sun, and rain. His small, black eyes

twinkled from his puffy, white face, like raisins in a dough-pudding.


He was ogling Mary amiably when the woman who kept the eating-house brought him

his breakfast. Mrs. Clark was a potent antidote for the prevailing spirit of

romance, even in this woman-forsaken country. A good creature, all limp calico,

Roman nose, and sharp elbows, she brought him his breakfast with an ill grace

that she had not shown to the others. The men about the table gave him scant

greeting, but the absence of enthusiasm didn’t embarrass Simpson.


He lounged expansively on the table, regarding Miss Carmichael attentively

meanwhile; then favored her with the result of his observations, “From

the East, I take it.” And the dumpling face screwed into a smile whose

mission was pacific.


Every knife and fork in the room suspended action in anxiety to know how the

“yearling” would take it. Would their chivalry, which strained at a

gnat, be compelled to swallow such a conspicuous camel as the success of

Simpson? With the attitude he had taken towards the girl, there had crept into

the company an imperceptible change; deep-buried impulses sprang to the

surface. If a scoundrel like Simpson was going to try his luck, why

shouldn’t they? They didn’t see a pretty girl once in a blue moon.

With the advent of the green-eyed monster at the board, each man unconsciously

became the rival of his neighbor.


But Miss Carmichael merely continued her breakfast, and if she heard the

amiable deductions of Simpson regarding her, she gave no sign. But a rebuff to

him was in the nature of an appetizer, a fillip to press the acquaintance. He

encroached a bit farther on the narrow limits of the table and continued,

“Nice weather we’re having.”


Miss Carmichael gave her undivided attention to her coffee. The spurs and

sombreros, that had not relaxed a muscle in their strained observation of the

little drama, breathed reflectively. Perhaps it was just as well that they had

not emulated Simpson in his brazen charge; the “yearling” was not

to be surprised into talking, that was certain.


“He shore is showing hisself to be a friendly native,” commented

the man who had sacrificed milk-teeth investigating the indestructible doll.


“Seems to me that the system he’s playing lacks a heap of science.

My money’s on the yearling.” And the man who had “discarded

the steak and drawn to the biscuits” leaned a little forward that he

might better watch developments.


Simpson by this time fully realized his error, but failure before all these

bantering youngsters was a contingency not to be accepted lightly. As he

phrased it to himself, it was worth “another throw.” “Seems

kind o’ lonesome not having any one to talk to while you’re

eatin’, don’t it?”


Miss Carmichael’s air of perfect composure seemed a trifle out of tune

with her surroundings; the nice elevation of eyebrow, the slightly questioning

curl of the lip as she, for the first time apparently, became aware of the man

opposite, seemed to demand a prim drawing-room rather than the atmosphere of

the slouching eating-house.


“Well, really, I’ve hardly had a chance of finding out.” And

her eyes were again on her coffee-cup. And there was joy among the men at table

that they had not rushed in after the manner of those who have a greater

courage than the angels.


“No offence meant,” deprecated Simpson, with an uneasy glance

towards the other end of the table, where the men sat with necks craned forward

in an attitude uncomfortably suggestive of hounds straining at the leash.

Simpson felt rather than saw that something was afoot among the sombreros.

There was a crowding together in whispered colloquy, and in a flash some

half-dozen of them were on their feet as a man. Descending upon Simpson, they

lifted him, chair and all, to the other end of the table, as far removed as

possible from Miss Carmichael.


The man who thought Simpson’s system lacked science rubbed his hands in

delight. “She took the trick all right; swept his hand clean off the

board!”


II.

The Encounter


Simpson, from the seat to which he had been so rapidly transplanted, looked

about him with blinking anxiety. It was more than probable that the boys

intended “to have fun with him,” though his talking, or rather

trying to talk, to a girl that sat opposite him at an eating-house table was,

according to his ethics, plainly none of their business. He knew he

wasn’t popular since he had done for Jim Rodney’s sheep, though the

crime had never been laid at his door, officially. He had his way to make, the

same as the next one; and, all said and done, the cattle-men were glad to get

Jim Rodney’s sheep off the range, even if they treated him as a felon for

the part he had played in their extermination.


Thus reasoned Simpson, while he marked with an uneasy eye that the temper of

the company had grown decidedly prankish with the exit of the girl, who, after

having caused all the trouble, had, with an irritating quality peculiar to her

sex, vanished through the kitchen door.


Some three or four of the boys now ran to Simpson’s former seat at the

table and rushed towards him with his half-eaten breakfast, as if the errand

had been one of life and death. They showered him with mock attentions, waiting

on him with an exaggerated deference, and the pale, fat man, remembering the

hideousness of some of their manifestations of a sense of humor, breathed hard

and felt a falling-off of appetite.


Costigan, the cattle-man, a strapping Irish giant, was clearing his throat with

ominous sounds that suggested the tuning-up of a bass fiddle.


“Sure, Simpson, me lad, if ye happen to have a matther av fifty dollars,

’tis mesilf that can tell ye av an illegint invistmint.”


Simpson looked up warily, but Costigan’s broad countenance did not harbor

the wraith of a smile. “What kin I git for fifty chips?

’Tain’t much,” mused the pariah, with the prompt inclination

to spend that stamps the comparative stranger to ready money.


“Ye can git a parrut, man—a grane parrut—to kape ye coompany

while ye’re aiting—”


Simpson interrupted with an oath.


“Don’t be hard on old Simmy; remember he’s studied for the

ministry! How did I savey that Simpson aimed to be a sharp on doctrine?”

A cow-puncher with a squint addressed the table in general. “I scents the

aroma of dogma about Simpson in the way he throwed his conversational lariat at

the yearling. He urbanes at her, and then comes his ‘firstly,’ it

being a speculation as to her late grazing-ground, which he concludes to be the

East. His ‘secondly’ ain’t nothing startling, words familiar

to us all from our mother’s knee—‘nice

weather’—the congregation ain’t visibly moved. His

‘thirdly’ is insinuating. In it he hints that it ain’t good

for man to be alone at meals—”


“’Twas the congregation that added the ‘foinelly,’

though, before hastily leaving be the back door!” and Costigan slapped

his thigh.


“The gentleman in question don’t seem to be makin’ much use

of his present conversational opportunities. I’m feelin’ kinder

turned down myself”; and the Texan began to look over his six-shooter.


The man with the squint looked up and down the board.


“Gentlemen, I believe the foregoing expresses the sentiment of this

company, which, while it incloodes many foreign and frequent-warring elements,

is at present held together by the natchral tie of eating.”


Thumping with knife and fork handles, stamping of feet, cries of “Hear!

hear!” with at least three cow-boy yells, argued well for a resumption of

last night’s festivities. Simpson glowered, but said nothing.


“Seems to me you-all goin’ the wrong way ’bout drawin’

Mistu’ Simpson out. He is shy an’ has to be played fo’ like a

trout, an’ heah you-all come at him like a cattle stampede.” The

big Texan leaned towards Simpson. “Now you-all watch my methods.

Mistu’ Simpson, seh, what du think of the prospects of rain?”


There was a general recommendation from Simpson that the entire company go to a

locality below the rain-belt.


A boy, plainly “from the East,” and looking as if the ink on his

graduating thesis had scarce had time to dry, was on his feet, swaggering; he

would not have swapped his newly acquired camaraderie with these bronzed

Westerners for the Presidency.


“Gentlemen, you have all heard Simpson say it is lonesome having no one

to talk to during meals. We sympathized with him and offered him a choice of

subjects. He greets our remarks by a conspicuous silence, varied by profanity.

This, gentlemen, reflects on us, and is a matter demanding public satisfaction.

All who feel that their powers as conversationalists have been impugned by the

silence of Simpson, please say ‘Ay.’”


“Ay” was howled, sung, and roared in every note of the gamut.


“If me yoong frind here an me roight”—and Costigan jerked a

shoulder towards the boy—“will be afther closin’ that

silf-feeding automatic dictionary av his for a moment, I shud be glad to call

the attintion av the coomp’ny to somethin’ in the nature av an

ixtinuatin’ circoomsthance in the case av Simpson.”


“Hear! hear!” they shouted. The broad countenance of Costigan

beamed with joy at what he was about to say. “Gintlemin, the silence av

Mr. Simpson is jew in all probabilitee to a certain ivint recalled by many here

prisint, an’ more that’s absent, an’ amicablee settled out av

coort—”


Up to this time the unhappy Simpson had shown an almost superhuman endurance.

Now he bristled—and after looking up and down the board for a sympathetic

face, and not finding one, he declared, loudly and generally,

“’Tain’t so!”


“Ye may have noticed that frind Simpson do be t’reatened wid

lockjaw in the societee av min, but in the prisince av a female ye can’t

count on him. Now, talk wid a female is an agreeable, if not a profitable, way

av passin’ the toime, but sure ye niver know where it will ind—as

witness Simpson. This lady I’m recallin’—’tis a matther

av two years ago—followed the ancient and honorable profission av biscuit

shootin’ not far from Caspar. Siz Simpson to the lady some such

passin’ civilitee as, ‘Good-marnin’; plisent weather

we’re havin’.’ Whereupon the lady filt a damage to her

affictions an’ sued him for breach av promise.”


“’Twan’t that way, at all!” screamed Simpson.

“’Sall a lie!”


“Yu ought er said ‘Good-evenin’’ to the lady, Mistu

Simpson; hit make a diffunce,” drawled the man from Texas, pleasantly.


“But ’twas ‘Good-marnin’’ Simpson made chyce

av,” resumed Costigan. “An’ the lady replied,

‘You’ve broke my heart.’ Whereupon Simpson, havin’ a

matther av t’ree thousand dollars to pay for his passin’ civilitee,

learned thot silince was goolden.”


They all remembered the incident in question, and thundered applause at the

reappearance of an old favorite. Without warning, a shadow fell across the

sunlight-flooded room, and, as one after another of the men glanced up from the

table, they saw standing in the doorway a man of such malignant aspect that his

look fell across the company like a menace. The swing of their banter slowed

suddenly; it was as if the cold of a new-turned grave had struck across the

June sunshine checking their roughshod fun. None of them had the hardihood to

joke with a man that stood in the shadow of death; and hate and murder looked

from the eyes of the man in the doorway and looked towards Simpson. One by one

they perceived the man of the shadow, all but Simpson, eating steak drowned in

Worcestershire.


The man in the doorway was tall and lean, and the prison blench upon his face

was in unpleasant contrast to the ruddy tan of the faces about the table. His

sombrero was tipped back and the hair hung dank about the pale, sweating

forehead, suggestive of sickness. But weak health did not imply weak purpose;

every feature in that hawk-like face was sharp with hatred, and in the

narrowing eye was vengeance that is sweet.


He stood still; there was in his hatred a something hypnotic that grew

imperceptibly and imperceptibly communicated itself to the men at table. He

gloated over the eating fat man as if he had dwelt much in imagination on the

sight and was in no hurry to curtail his joy at the reality. The men began to

get restless, shuffle their feet, moisten their lips; only the college boy

spoke, and then from a wealth of ignorance, knowing nothing of the rugged,

give-and-take justice of the plains—an eye for an eye, a tooth for a

tooth, and the law and the courts go hang while a man’s got a right arm

to pull a trigger. Not one in all that company, even the cattle-men whose

interests were opposed to Rodney’s, but felt the justice of his errand.


“When did they let him out?” whispered the college boy; and then,

“Oughtn’t we to do something?”


“Yis, me son,” whispered Costigan. “We ought to sit still and

learn a thing or two.”


The fat man cleaned his plate with a crust of bread stuck on the point of a

knife. There was nothing more to eat in the way of substantials, and he debated

pouring a little more of the sauce on his plate and mopping it with a bit of

bread still uneaten. Considering the pro and con of this extra tid-bit, he

glanced up and saw the gaunt man standing in the doorway.


Simpson dropped the knife from his shaking hand and started up with a cry that

died away in a gurgle, an inhuman, nightmare croak. He looked about wildly,

like a rat in a trap, then backed towards the wall. The men about the table got

up, then cleared away in a circle, leaving the fat man. It was all like a dream

to the college boy, who had never seen a thing of the kind before and could not

realize now that it was happening. Rodney advanced, never once relaxing the

look in which he seemed to hold his enemy as in a vise. Simpson was like a man

bewitched. Once, twice, he made a grab for his revolver, but his right hand

seemed to have lost power to heed the bidding of his will. Rodney, now well

towards the centre of the room, waited, with a suggestion of ceremony, for

Simpson to get his six-shooter.


It was one of those moments in which time seems to have become petrified. The

limp-clad proprietress of the eating-house, made curious by the sudden silence,

looked in from the kitchen. Simpson, his eyes wandering like a trapped rat,

saw, and called, through teeth that chattered in an ague of fear,

“Ree—memm—her thth—there’s la—dies

p—present! For Gawd’s sake, remember t—there’s ladies

p—present!”


The pale man looked towards the kitchen, and, seeing the woman, he gave Simpson

a look in which there was only contempt. “You’ve hid behind the law

once, and this time it’s petticoats. The open don’t seem to have no

charm for you. But—” He didn’t finish, there was no need to.

Every one knew and understood. He put up his revolver and walked into the

street.


The men broke into shouts of laughter, loud and ringing, then doubled up and

had it out all over again. And their noisy merriment was as clear an indication

of the suddenly lifted strain, at the averted shooting, as it was of their

enjoyment of the farce. Simpson, relieved of the fear of sudden death, now

sought to put a better face on his cowardice. Now that his enemy was well out

of sight, Simpson handled his revolver with easy assurance.


“Put ut up,” shouted Costigan, above the general uproar.

“’Tis toime to fear a revolver in the hands av Simpson whin

he’s no intinsions av shootin’.”


Simpson still attempted to harangue the crowd, but his voice was lost in the

general thigh-slapping and the shouts and roars that showed no signs of

abating. But when he caught a man by the coat lapel in his efforts to secure a

hearing, that was another matter, and the man shook him off as if his touch

were contagion. Simpson, craving mercy on account of petticoats, evading a

meeting that was “up to him,” they were willing to stand as a

laughing-stock, but Simpson as an equal, grasping the lapels of their coats,

they would have none of.


He slunk away from them to a corner of the eating-house, feeling the stigma of

their contempt, yet afraid to go out into the street where his enemy might be

waiting for him. Much of death and blood and recklessness “Town”

had seen and condoned, but cowardice was the unforgivable sin. It balked the

rude justice of these frontiersmen and tampered with their code, and Simpson

knew that the game had gone against him.


“What was it all about? Were they in earnest, or was it only their way of

amusing themselves?” inquired Mary Carmichael, who had slipped into Mrs.

Clark’s kitchen after the men at the table had taken things in hand.


“Jim Rodney was in earnest, an’ he had reason to be. That man

Simpson was paid by a cattle outfit—now, mind, I ain’t sayin’

which—to get Jim Rodney’s sheep off the range. They had threatened

him and cut the throats of two hundred of his herd as a warning, but Jim went

right on grazin’ ’em, same as he had always been in the habit of

doing. Well, I’m told they up and makes Simpson an offer to get rid of

the sheep. Jim has over five thousand, an’ it’s just before

lambing, and them pore ewes, all heavy, is being druv’ down to

Watson’s shearing-pens, that Jim always shears at. Jim an’ two

herders and a couple of dawgs—least, this is the way I heard it—is

drivin’ ’em easy, ’cause, as I said before, it’s just

before lambing. It does now seem awful cruel to me to shear just before

lambing, but that’s their way out here.


“Well, nothing happens, and Jim ain’t more’n two hours from

the pens an’ he comes to that place on the road that branches out over

the top of a cañon, and there some one springs out of a clump of willows

an’ dashes into the herd and drives the wether that’s leading right

over the cliff. The leaders begin to follow that wether, and they go right over

the cliff like the pore fools they are. The herder fired and tried to drive

’em back, they tell me, an’ he an’ the dawg were shot at from

the clump of willows by some one else who was there. Three hundred sheep had

gone over the cliff before Jim knew what was happening. He rode like mad right

through the herd to try and head ’em off; but you know what sheep is

like—they’re like lost souls headin’ for damnation. Nothing

can stop ’em when they’re once started. And Jim lost every

head—started for the shearing-pens a rich man—rich for

Jim—an’ seen everything he had swept away before his eyes, his wife

an’ children made paupers. My son he come by and found him. He said that

Jim was sittin’ huddled up in a heap, his knees drawed up under his chin,

starin’ straight up into the noonday sky, same as if he was askin’

God how He could be so cruel. His dead dawg, that they had shot, was by the

side of him. The herder that was with Jim had taken the one that was shot into

Watson’s, so when my son found Jim he was alone, sittin’ on the

edge of the cliff with his dead dawg, an’ the sky about was black with

buzzards; an’ Jim he just sat an’ stared up at ’em, and when

my son spoke to him he never answered any more than a dead man. He shuck him by

the arm, but Jim just sat there, watchin’ the sun, the buzzards, and the

dead sheep.”


“Was nothing done to this man Simpson?”


“The cattle outfit that he done the dirty work for swore an alibi for

him. Jim has been in hard luck ever since. He’s been rustlin’

cattle right along; but Lord, who can blame him? He got into some trouble down

to Rawlins—shot a man he thought was with Simpson, but who

wasn’t—and he’s been in jail ever since. Course now that

he’s out Simpson’s bound to get peppered. Glad it didn’t

happen here, though. ’Twould be a kind of unpleasant thing to have

connected with a eating-house, don’t you think so?” she inquired,

with the grim philosophy of the country.


The eating-house patrons had gone their several ways, and the quiet of the

dining-room was oppressive by contrast with its late boisterousness. Mrs.

Clark, her hands imprisoned in bread-dough, begged Mary to look over the screen

door and see if anything was happening. “I’m always suspicious when

it’s quiet. I know they’re in deviltry of some sort.”


Mary tiptoed to the door and peeped over, but the room was deserted, save for

Simpson, huddled in a corner, biting his finger-nails. “The nasty

thing!” exploded Mrs. Clark, when she had received the bulletin.

“I’d turn him out if it wasn’t for the notoriety he might

bring my place in gettin’ killed in front of it.”


“I dare say I’d better go and see after my trunk; it’s still

on the station platform.” Mary wondered what her prim aunts would think

of her for sitting in Mrs. Clark’s kitchen, but it had seemed so much

more of a refuge than the sordid streets of the hideous little town, with its

droves of men and never a glimpse of a woman that she had been only too glad to

avail herself of the invitation of the proprietress to “make herself at

home till the stage left.”


“Well, good luck to you,” said Mrs. Clark, wiping her hand only

partially free from dough and presenting it to Miss Carmichael. She had not

inquired where the girl was going, nor even hinted to discover where she came

from, but she gave her the godspeed that the West knows how to give, and the

girl felt better for it.


At the station, where Mary shortly presented herself, in the interest of that

old man of the sea of all travellers, luggage, she learned that the stage did

not leave town for some three-quarters of an hour yet. A young man,

manipulating many sheets of flimsy, yellow paper covered with large,

flourishing handwriting, looked up in answer to her inquiries about Lost Trail.

This young man, whose accent, clothes, and manner proclaimed him “from

the East,” whither, in all probability, he would shortly return if he did

not mend his ways, disclaimed all knowledge of the place as if it were an

undesirable acquaintance. But before he could deny it thrice, a man who had

heard the cabalistic name was making his way towards the desk, the pride of the

traveller radiating from every feature.


The cosmopolite who knew Lost Trail was the type of man who is born to be a

Kentucky colonel, and perhaps may have achieved his destiny before coming to

this “No Man’s Land,” for reasons into which no one inquired,

and which were obviously no one’s business. They knew him here by the

name of “Lone Tooth Hank,” and he wore what had been, in the days

of his colonelcy—or its equivalent—a frock-coat, restrained by the

lower button, and thus establishing a waist-line long after nature had had the

last word to say on the subject. With this he wore the sombrero of the country,

and the combination carried a rakish effect that was positively sinister.


The scornful clerk introduced Mary as a young lady inquiring about some place

in the bad-lands. Off came the sombrero with a sweep, and Lone Tooth smiled in

a way that accented the dental solitaire to which he owed his name. Miss

Carmichael, concealing her terror of this casual cavalier, inquired if he could

tell her the distance to Lost Trail.


“I sho’ly can, and with, consid’able pleasure.” The

sombrero completed a semicircular sweep and arrived in the neighborhood of Mr.

Hank’s heart in significance of his vassalage to the fair sex. He

proceeded:


“Lost Trail sutney is right lonesome. A friend of mine gets a little too

playful fo’ the evah-increasin’ meetropolitan spirit of this yere

camp, and tries a little tahget practice on the main bullyvard, an’ finds

the atmospheah onhealthful in consequence. Hearin’ that the quiet

solitude of Lost Trail is what he needs, he lit out with the following

circumstance thereof happenin’. One day something in his harness

giv’ way—and he recollects seein’ a boot sunnin’ itself

back in the road ’bout a quartah of a mile. An’ he figgahs

he’ll borry a strip of leather off the boot to mend his harness. Back he

goes and finds it has a kind of loaded feelin’. So my friend

investigates—and I be blanked if there wasn’t a foot and leg inside

of it.”


Miss Carmichael had always exercised a super-feminine self-restraint in the

case of casual mice, and it served her in the present instance. Instead of

screaming, she said, after the suppression of a gasp or two:


“Thank you so much, but I won’t detain you any longer. Your

information makes Lost Trail even more interesting than I had expected.”


Besides, Miss Carmichael had a faint suspicion that this might be a

preconcerted plan to terrify the “lady tenderfoot,” and she prided

herself on being equal to the situation. The time at her disposal before the

stage would embark on that unknown sea of prairies she spent in the delectable

pastime of shopping. The financial and social interests of the town seemed to

converge in Hugous & Co.’s “trading store,” where Miss

Carmichael invested in an extra package of needles for the mere excitement of

being one of the shoppers, though her aunt Adelaide had stocked the little

plaid-silk work-bag to repletion with every variety of needle known to woman.

She pricked up her ears, meanwhile, at some of the purchases made by the

cow-boys for their camp-larders—devilled ham, sardines, canned tomatoes

heading the list as prime favorites. Did these strapping border lads live by

the fruit of the tin alone? Apparently yes, with the sophisticated

accompaniment of soda biscuit, to judge by the quantity of baking-powder they

invested in—literally pounds of it. Men in any other condition of life

would have died of slow poisoning as the result of it.


There were other customers at Hugous’ that morning besides the spurred

and booted cow-puncher and his despised compeer, the sheep-herder. That

restless emigrant class, whose origin, as a class, lay in the community of its

own uncertain schemes of fortune; the West, with her splendid, lavish promises,

called them from their thriftless farms in the South and their gray cabins in

New England. They began their journeying towards the land of promise long

before the Indians had ever seen the shrieking “fire-wagon.” All

day they would toil over the infinitude of prairie, the sun that hid nightly

behind that maddeningly elusive vanishing-point, the horizon, their only guide.

But the makeshifts of the wagon life were not without charm. They began to

wander in quest of they knew not precisely what, and from these vague

beginnings there had sprung into existence that nomadic population that was

once such a feature of the far West, but is now going the way of the Indians

and the cow-boys.


This breathing-space in the long journey had for them the stimulus of a

holiday-making. They bought their sides of bacon and their pounds of coffee as

merrily as if they were playing a game of forfeits, the women fingering the

calico they did not want for the joy of pricing and making shoppers’

talk.


The scene had a scriptural flavor that not even the blue overalls of the men

nor the calico gowns of the women could altogether eliminate. Their wagons,

bulging with household goods and trailing with kitchen utensils secured by bits

of rope, were drawn up in front of the trading-store. From a pump, at some

little distance, the pilgrims filled their stone water-bottles, for the wise

traveller does not trust to the chance springs of the desert. Baskets of

chickens were strapped to many of the wagons, but whether the unhappy fowls

were designed to supply fresh eggs and an occasional fricassée, or were taken

for the pleasure of their company, there was no means of determining short of

impertinent cross-questioning. Sometimes a cow, and invariably a dog, formed

one of the family party, and an edifying esprit de corps seemed to dwell

among them all.


Lone Tooth Hank, in his capacity of man about town, stood on the steps of

Hugous’ watching the preparations; and, seeing Miss Carmichael,

approached with the air of an old and tried family friend.


“Do I obsehve yu regyarding oweh ‘settleahs,’ called

settleahs ’cause they nevah settle?” Hank laughed gently, as one

who has made a joke meet for ladies. “I’ve known whole famblies to

bohn an’ raise right in one of them wagons; and tuhn out a mighty fine,

endurin’ lot, too, this hyeh prospectin’ round afteh

somethin’ they wouldn’t reco’nize if they met. Gits to be a

habit same as drink. They couldn’t live in a house same as humans, not if

yu filled their gyarden with nuggets an’ their well with

apple-jack.”


Miss Carmichael looked attentive but said nothing. In truth, she was more

afraid of Hank, his obvious gallantry, and his grewsome tales of boots with

legs in them than she was of the unknown terrors of Lost Trail.


“I believe that is my stage,” she said, as a red conveyance not

unlike a circus wagon halted at some little distance from the trading-store.

And as she spoke she saw four of her companions of the breakfast-table heading

towards the stage, each with a piece of her precious luggage. Mary Carmichael

was precipitated in a sudden panic; she had heard tales of the pranks of these

playful Western squires—a little gun-play to induce the terrified

tenderfoot to put a little more spirit into his Highland fling, “by

request.” She remembered their merrymaking with Simpson at breakfast.

What did they intend to do with her belongings? And as she remembered the

little plaid sewing-bag that Aunt Adelaide had made for

her—surreptitiously drying her tears in the mean time—when she

remembered that bag and the possibility of its being submitted to ignominy, she

could have cried or done murder, she wasn’t sure which.


“Well, ’pon my wohd, heah ah the boys with yo’ baggage. How

time du fly!”


“Oh!” she gasped, “what are they going to do with it?”


“Place it on the stage, awaitin’ yo’ ohdahs.” And to

her expression of infinite relief—“Yo’ didn’t think any

disrepec’ would be shown the baggage of a lady honorin’ this hyeh

metropolis with her presence?”


She thanked the knights of the lariat the more warmly for her unjust

suspicions. They stowed away the luggage with the deft capacity of men who have

returned to the primitive art of using their hands. She climbed beside the

driver on the box of the stage. Lone Tooth Hank and the cow-punchers

chivalrously raised their sombreros with a simultaneous spontaneity that

suggested a flight of rockets. The driver cracked his whip and turned the

horses’ heads towards the billowing sea of foot-hills, and the last cable

that bound Mary Carmichael to civilization was cut.


III.

Leander And His Lady


The only stage passenger besides Miss Carmichael was a fat lady, whose entire

luggage seemed to consist of luncheon—pasteboard boxes of sandwiches,

baskets of fruit, napkins of cake. These she began to dispose of, before the

stage had fairly started, with an industry almost automatic, continuing

faithful to her post as long as the supplies lasted. Then she dozed, sleeping

the sleep of the just and those who keep their mouths open. From time to time

the stage-driver invoked his team in cabalistic words, and each time the horses

toiled forward with fresh energy; but progress became a mockery in that ocean

of space, their driving seemed as futile as the sport of children who crack a

whip and play at stage-coach with a couple of chairs; the mountains still

mocked in the distance.


A flat, unbroken sweep of country, a tangle of straggling sage-brush, a glimpse

of foot-hills in the distance, was the outlook mile after mile. The day grew

pitilessly hot. Clouds of alkaline dust swept aimlessly over the desert or

whirled into spirals till lost in space. From horizon to horizon the sky was

one cloudless span of blue that paled as it dipped earthward. Mary Carmichael

dozed and wakened, but the prospect was always the same—the red stage

crawling over the wilderness, making no evident progress, and always the sun,

the sage-brush, and the silence.


It was all so overwhelmingly different from the peaceful atmosphere of things

at home. The mellow Virginia country, with its winding, red roads, wealth of

woodland, and its grave old houses that were the more haughtily aloof for the

poverty that gnawed at their vitals. This wilderness was so gaunt, so parched;

she closed her eyes and thought of a bit of landscape at home. A young forest

of silver beeches growing straight and fine as the threads on a loom; and

through the gray perspective of their satin-smooth trunks you caught the white

gleam of a fairy cascade as it tumbled over the moss-grown stones to the brook

below. It was like a bit from a Japanese garden in its delicate artificiality.


And harder to leave than these cherished bits of landscape had been the old

house Runnymede, that always seemed dozing in the peaceful comatose of

senility. It was beyond the worry of debt; the succession of mortgages that

sapped its vitality and wrote anxious lines on the faces of Aunt Adelaide and

Aunt Martha was nothing to the old house. Had it not sheltered Carmichaels for

over a century?—it had faith in the name. But Mary could never remember

when the need of money to pay the mortgage had not invaded the gentle routine

of their home-life, robbing the sangaree of its delicate flavor in the long,

sleepy summer afternoons, invading the very dining-room, an unwelcome guest at

the old mahogany table, prompting Aunt Adelaide to cast anxious glances at the

worn silver—would it go to pay that blood-sucking mortgage next?


But hardest of all to leave had been Archie, best and most promising of young

brothers—Archie, who had come out ahead of his class in the high-school,

all ready to go to The University—the University of Virginia is always

“The University”; but who, it had seemed at a certain dark season,

must give up this long-cherished hope for lack of the wherewithal. Mary, being

four years older than her brother and quite twenty, had long felt a maternal

obligation to administer his affairs. If he did not go to the university, like

his father and grandfather before him, it would be because she had failed in

her duty. At this particular phase of the domestic problem there had appeared,

in a certain churchly periodical, a carefully worded advertisement for a

governess, and the subsequent business of references, salary, and information

to be imparted and received proving eminently satisfactory, Mary had finally

received a tearful permission from her aunts to depart for some place in

Wyoming, the name of which was not even to be found on the map. She was to

consider herself quite one of the family, and the compensation was to be fifty

dollars a month. Archie would now be able to go to “The

University.”


As the day wore on the sage-brush became scarcer and grayer, there were fewer

flowering cacti, and the great white patches of alkali grew more and more

frequent. In the distance there was a riot of rainbow tints—violet, pink,

and pale orange. It seemed inconceivable that such barrenness could produce

such wealth of color; nothing could have been more beautiful—not even the

changing colors on a pigeon’s neck—than the coppery iridescence,

shading to cobalt and blue on some of the buttes.


Night had fallen before they made the first break in their journey. The low,

beetle-browed cabin that faced them in the wilderness carried in its rude

completeness a hint of the prestidigitateur’s art—a world of

desolation, and behold a log cabin with smoke issuing from the chimney and

curtains at the windows! The interior was unplastered, but this shortcoming was

surmounted by tacking cheesecloth neatly over the logs, a device at once simple

and strategic, as in the lamplight the effect was that of plaster. Miss

Carmichael, suddenly released from the actual rumbling of the stage, felt its

confused motion the more strongly in imagination, and hardly knew whether she

was eating canned tomatoes, served uncooked directly from the tin, fried steak,

black coffee, and soda biscuit, in company with the fat lady, the stage-driver,

and the woman who kept the road ranch, or if it was all some Alice in

Wonderland delusion.


The fat lady had brought her own bedding—an apoplectic roll of

bedquilts—and these she insisted on making a bed of, despite the protests

of the ranch-woman, who seemed to detect a covert insinuation against her

accommodations in the precedent. Miss Carmichael profited by the controversy.

The landlady, touched no doubt by the simple faith of a traveller who trusted

to the beds of a road-ranch, or because she was young or a girl, led the way in

triumph to her own bedroom, and indicating an imposing affair with

pillow-shams, she defied Miss Carmichael to find a more comfortable bed

“in the East.”


In the unaccountable manner of these desert conveyances, that creak and groan

across the arid wastes with an apparently lumbering inconsequence, the stage

that brought the travellers to the Dax ranch left at sunrise to pursue a

seemingly erratic career along the North Platte, while Miss Carmichael and the

fat lady were to continue their journey with one Lemuel Chugg, who drove a

stage northward towards the Red Desert, when he was sober enough to handle the

ribbons.


Breakfast was largely devoted to speculation regarding the approximate

condition of Mr. Chugg—would he be wholly or partially incapacitated for

his job? Mrs. Dax, flirting a feather-duster in the neighborhood of Miss

Carmichael in a futile effort to beguile her into giving a reason for her

solitary journey across the desert, took a gloomy view of the situation.


But Miss Carmichael kept her own counsel. Not so the fat lady. Falling into the

snare ingenuously set for another, she divulged her name, place of residence,

and the object of her travels, which was to visit a son on Sweetwater.

Furthermore, she stated the probable cause of every death in her family for the

past thirty-five years. Miss Carmichael felt an especial interest in an Uncle

Henry who “died of a Friday along of eating clams.” He stood out

with such refreshing vividness against a background of neutralities who

succumbed to consumption, bile colic, and other more familiar ailments of the

patent-medicine litany. But loquacity, apparently, like virtue, is its own

reward, for the landlady scarce vouchsafed a comment on this dismal recitative,

while Miss Carmichael remained the object of her persistent attentions.


But there seemed to be no topic of universal interest but Chugg’s

condition, Mrs. Dax finally asserting, “Before I’d trust my

precious neck to him, I’d get Mr. Dax to shoot me.”


Meditating on this Spartan statement, Mary and the fat lady became aware for

the first time of a subtle, silent force in the domestic economy. But so

unobtrusive was this influence that one had to scrutinize very closely, indeed,

to detect the evanescent personality of Mrs. Dax’s husband. Leander was

his name, but it is safe to say that he swam no Hellesponts for the masterful

wife of his bosom. Otherwise he was slender, willowy, bald; if he ever stood

straight enough to get the habitually apologetic crooks out of his knees, he

would be tall; but so in the habit was he of repressing himself in the marital

presence that Leander passed for middle height. He waited on the table at

breakfast with the dumb submissiveness of a trained dog that has been taught to

give pathetic imitations of human servility. But no sooner had his lady left

the room than Leander began quite brazenly to call attention to himself as a

man and an individual, coughing, rattling his dishes, and clearing his throat.

Mary and the fat lady, out of very pity, responded to these crude signals with

overtures equally frank, and Leander ventured finally to inquire if they aimed

to spend the night at his brother’s ranch, it being the next mess-box

between here and nowhere. They admitted that his brother’s ranch was

their next stopping-place, and Leander went through perfect contortions of

apology and self-effacement before he could bring himself to ask them to do him

a favor. It would have taken a very stern order of womankind to refuse anything

so abject, and they blindly committed themselves to the pledge.


“Tell him I send my compliments,” he whispered, and, looking about

him furtively, he repeated the blood-curdling request.


“Is that all?” sniffed the fat lady, at no pains to conceal her

disappointment.


“It’s enough, if it was known, to raise a war-whoop and stampede

this yere family.” His glance at the door through which his wife had

disappeared was pregnant with meaning.


“Family troubles?” asked the fat lady, as a gourmet might say

“Truffles.”


“Looks like it,” said Leander, dismally. “Me and Johnnie

don’t ask for nothin’ better than to bask in each other’s

company; but our wives insists on keepin’ up the manœuvres of a

war-dance the whole endoorin’ time.”


“So,” said the fat lady, as a gourmet might tell of a favorite way

of preparing truffles, “it’s a case of wives?”


“Yes, marm, an’ teeth an’ nails an’ husbands thrown in,

when they get a sight of each other’s petticoats.”


“I’ve known sisters-in-law not to agree,” helped on the fat

lady, by way of an encouraging parallel.


“While I deplores usin’ such a comparison to the refinin’ and

softenin’ inflooance of wimmen, the meetin’ of the Dax ladies by

chanst anywheres has all the elements of danger and excitement that accompanies

an Injun uprisin’.”


The travellers looked all manner of encouragement.


“You see, my wife’s a great housekeeper; her talent

lies”—and here Leander winked knowingly—“in

managin’ the help.”


“Land’s sake!” interrupted the fat lady. “Why

don’t you kick?”


Leander sighed softly. “I tried to once. As an experiment it partook of

the trustfulness of a mule kickin’ against the stony walls of Badger

Cañon. But to resoom about the difficulties that split the Dax family. Before

Johnnie got mislaid in that matrimonial landslide o’ his, he herds with

us. Me an’ him does the work of this yere shack, and my wife just

roominates and gives her accomplishments as manager full play. She never put

her hand in dirty water any more than Mrs. Cleveland sittin’ up in the

White House parlor. Johnnie done the fancy cookin’; he could make a pie

like any one’s maw, and while you was lost to the world in the delights

of masticatin’ it, he’d have all his greasy dishes washed up and

put away—”


“No wonder she hated to lose a man like that,” interrupted the fat

lady, feelingly.


“But he took to pinin’ and proclaimin’ that he shore was a

lone maverick, and he just stampeded round lookin’ for trouble and

bleatin’ a song that went:


“‘No one to love,

None to caress.’


“Well, the lady that answers his signal of distress don’t bear none

of the brands of this yere range. She lives back East, and him and her took up

their claims in each other’s affections through a matrimonial paper known

as The Heart and Hand. So they takes their pens in hand and gets through a hard

spell of courtin’ on paper. Love plumb locoes Johnnie. His spellin’

don’t suit him, his handwritin’ don’t suit him, his natchral

letters don’t suit him. So off he sends to Denver for all the

letter-writin’ books he can buy—Handbook of Correspondence, The

Epistolary Guide, The Ready Letter-Writer, and a stack more. There’s no

denyin’ it, Johnnie certainly did sweat hisself over them letters.”


“Land’s sakes!” said the fat lady.


“Yes, marm; he used to read ’em to me, beginnin’ how he had

just seized five minutes to write to her, when he’d worked the whole day

like a mule over it. She seemed to like the brand, an’ when he sent her

the money to come out here an’ get married, she come as straight as if

she had been mailed with a postage-stamp.”


“The brazen thing!” said the fat lady.


“They stopped here, goin’ home to their place. My Lord!

warn’t she a high-flyer! She done her hair like a tied-up

horse-tail—my wife called it a Sikey knot—and it stood out a foot

from her head. Some of the boys, kinder playful, wanted to throw a hat at it

and see if it wouldn’t hang, but they refrained, out of respect to the

feelin’s of the groom.


“From the start,” continued Leander, “the two Mrs. Daxes just

hankered to get at each other; an’ while I, as a slave to the fair

sex”—here he bowed to the fat lady and to Miss

Carmichael—“hesitates to use such langwidge in their presence, the

attitood of them two female wimmin shorely reminds me of a couple of unfriendly

dawgs just hankerin’ to chaw each other.


“At first, Johnnie waited on her hand an’ foot, and she just read

novels and played stylish all the time and danced. She was the hardest dancer

that ever struck this yere trail, and she could give lessons to any old

war-dancin’ chief up to the reservation. No dance she ever heard of was

too far for her to go to. She just went and danced till broad daylight. Many a

man would have took to dissipation, in his circumstances, but Johnnie just lost

heart and grew slatterly. Why, he’d leave his dishes go from one day till

the next—”


“There’s more as would leave their dishes from one day till the

next if they wasn’t looked after.” And the wife of his bosom stood

in the door like a vengeful household goddess. Mr. Dax made a grab for the

nearest plates.


IV.

Judith, The Postmistress


The arrival of Chugg’s stage with the mail should have been coincident

with the departure of the stage that brought the travellers from

“Town,” but Chugg was late—a tardiness ascribed to indulgence

in local lethe waters, for Lemuel Chugg had survived a romance and drank to

forget that woman is a variable and a changeable thing. In consequence of which

the sober stage-driver departed without the mails, leaving Mary Carmichael and

the fat lady to scan the horizon for the delinquent Chugg, and incidentally to

hear a chapter of prairie romance.


Some sort of revolution seemed to be in progress in the room in which the

travellers had breakfasted. Mrs. Dax had assumed the office of dictator, with

absolute sway. Leander, as aide-de-camp, courier, and staff, executed

marvellous feats of domestic engineering. The late breakfast-table, swept and

garnished with pigeon-holes, became a United States post-office, prepared to

transact postal business, and for the time being to become the social centre of

the surrounding country.


Down the yellow road that climbed and dipped and climbed and dipped again over

foot-hills and sprawling space till it was lost in a world without end, Mary

Carmichael, standing in the doorway, watched an atom, so small that it might

have been a leaf blowing along in the wind, turn into a horseman.


There was inspiration for a hundred pictures in the way that horse was ridden.

No flashes of daylight between saddle and rider in the jolting, Eastern

fashion, but the long, easy sweep that covers ground imperceptibly and is a

delight to the eye. It needed but the solitary figure to signify the infinitude

of space in the background. In all that great, wide world the only hint of life

was the galloping horseman, the only sound the rhythmical ring of the nearing

hoofs. The rider, now close enough for Miss Carmichael to distinguish the

features, was a thorough dandy of the saddle. No slouching garb of exigence and

comfort this, but a pretty display of doeskin gaiter, varnished boot, and smart

riding-breeches. The lad—he could not have been, Miss Carmichael thought,

more than twenty—was tanned a splendid color not unlike the bloomy

shading on a nasturtium. And when the doughty horseman made out the girl

standing in the doorway, he smiled with a lack of formality not suggested by

the town-cut of his trappings. Throwing the reins over the neck of the horse

with the real Western fling, he slid from the saddle in a trice, and—Mary

Carmichael experienced something of the gasping horror of a shocked old lady as

she made out two splendid braids of thick, black hair. Her doughty cavalier was

no cavalier at all, but a surprisingly handsome young woman.


Miss Carmichael gasped a little even as she extended her hand, for the

masquerader had pulled off her gauntlet and held out hers as if she was

conferring the freedom of the wilderness. It was impossible for a homesick girl

not to respond to such heartiness, though it was with difficulty at first that

Mary kept her eyes on the girl’s face. Curiosity, agreeably piqued, urged

her to take another glimpse of the riding clothes that this young woman wore

with such supreme unconcern.


Now, “in the East” Mary Carmichael had not been in the habit of

meeting black-haired goddesses who rode astride and whose assurance of the

pleasure of meeting her made her as self-conscious as on her first day at

dancing-school; and though she tried to prove her cosmopolitanism by not

betraying this, the attempt was rather a failure.


“Are you surprised that I did not wait for an introduction?” the

girl in the riding clothes asked, noticing Mary’s evident uneasiness;

“but you don’t know how good it is to see a girl. I’m so

tired of spurs and sombreros and cattle and dust and distance, and

there’s nothing else here.”


“Where I come from it’s just the other way—too many

petticoats and hat-pins.”


The horseman who was no horseman dropped Miss Carmichael’s hand and went

into the house. Mary wondered if she ought to have been more cordial.


From the back door came Leander, with dishcloths, which he began to hang on the

line in a dumb, driven sort of way.


“Who is she?” asked Mary.


“Her?” he interrogated, jerking his head in the direction of the

house. “The postmistress, Judith Rodney; yes, that’s her

name.” He dropped his voice in the manner of one imparting momentous

things. “She never wears a skirt ridin’, any more than a

man.”


Mary felt that she was tempting Leander into the paths of gossip, undoubtedly

his besetting sin, but she could not resist the temptation to linger. He had

disposed of his last dish-cloth, and he withdrew the remaining clothes-pin from

his mouth in a way that was pathetically feminine.


“She keeps the post-office here, since Mrs. Dax lost the job, and boards

with us; p’r’aps it’s because she is my wife’s

successor in office, or p’a’ps it’s jest the natural grudge

that wimmin seem to harbor agin each other, I dunno, but they don’t

sandwich none.”


Leander having disposed of his last dish-towel, squinted at it through his

half-closed eyes, like an artist “sighting” a landscape, saw

apparently that it was in drawing, and next brought his vision to bear on the

back premises of his own dwelling, where he saw there was no wifely figure in

evidence.


“Sh-sh-h!” he said, creeping towards Mary, his dull face

transfigured with the consciousness that he had news to tell.

“Sh-sh—her brother’s a rustler. If ’twan’t for

her”—Leander went through the grewsome pantomime of tying an

imaginary rope round his neck and throwing it over the limb of an imaginary

tree. “They’re goin’ to get him for shore this time, soon as

he comes out of jail; but would you guess it from her bluff?”


There was no mistaking the fate of a rustler after Mr. Dax’s grisly

demonstration, but of the quality of his calling Mary was as ignorant as

before.


“And why should they do that?” she inquired, with tenderfoot

simplicity.


“Stealin’ cattle ain’t good for the health hereabouts,”

said Leander, as one who spoke with authority. “It’s apt to bring

on throat trouble.”


But Mary did not find Leander’s joke amusing. She had suddenly remembered

the pale, gaunt man who had walked into the eating-house the previous morning

and walked out again, his errand turned into farce-comedy by the cowardice of

an unworthy antagonist. The pale man’s grievance had had to do with sheep

and cattle. His name had been Rodney, too. She understood now. He was Judith

Rodney’s brother, and he was in danger of being hanged. Mary Carmichael

felt first the admiration of a girl, then the pity of a woman, for the brave

young creature who so stoutly carried so unspeakable a burden. But she could

not speak of her new knowledge to Leander.


She glanced towards this childlike person and saw from his stealthy manner that

he had more to impart. He walked towards the kitchen door, saw no one, and came

back to Mary.


“There ain’t a man in this Gawd-forsaken country wouldn’t

lope at the chance to die for her—but the women!” Leander’s

pantomimic indication of absolute feminine antagonism was conclusive.


“The wimmin treats her scabby—just scabby. Don’t you go to

thinkin’ she ain’t a good girl on that account”; and

something like an attitude of chivalrous protection straightened the apologetic

crook in his craven outline.


“She’s good, just good, and when a woman’s that there’s

no use in sayin’ it any more fanciful. As I says to my wife, every time

she give me a chance, ‘If Judy wasn’t a good girl these boys about

here would just natchrally become extinct shootin’ each other upon

account of her.’ But she don’t favor none enough to cause

trouble.”


“Are the women jealous of her?”


“It’s her independence that riles ’em. They take on awful

about her ridin’ in pants, an’ it certainly is a heap more modest

than ridin’ straddle in a hitched up caliker skirt, same as some of them

do.”


“And do all the women out here ride astride?” Mary gasped.


“A good many does, when you ain’t watchin’; horses in these

parts ain’t broke for no such lopsided foolishness as side-saddles. But

you see she does it becomin’, and that’s where the grudge comes in.

You can’t stir about these foot-hills without coming across a woman, like

as not, holdin’ on to a posse of kids, and ridin’ clothes-pin

fashion in a looped-up skirt; when she sees you comin’ she’ll

p’r’aps upset a kid or two assoomin’ a decorous attitood.

That’s feeminine, and as such is approved by the ladies,

but”—and here Leander put his head on one side and gave a grotesque

impression of outraged decorum—“pants is considered

unwomanly.”


“Leander! Leander!” came in accusing accents from the kitchen.


“Run!” gasped Mrs. Dax’s handmaiden; “don’t let

her catch us chinnin’.”


Mary Carmichael ran round one side of the house as she was bidden, but, like

Lot’s wife, could not resist the temptation of looking back. Leander,

with incredible rapidity, grabbed two clothes-pins off the line, clutched a

dish-towel, shook it. “Comin’! comin’!” he called, as

he went through the farce of rehanging it.


The lonesomeness of plain and foot-hill, the utter lack of the human element

that gives to this country its character of penetrating desolation, had been

changed while Mary Carmichael forgathered with Leander by the clothes-line.

From the four quarters of the compass, men in sombreros, flannel shirts, and

all manner of strange habiliments came galloping over the roads as if their

horses were as keen on reaching Dax’s as their riders. They came towards

the house at full tilt, their horses stretching flat with ears laid back

viciously, and Mary, who was unused to the tricks of cow-ponies, expected to

see them ride through the front door, merely by way of demonstrating their

sense of humor. Not so; the little pintos, buckskins, bays, and chestnuts

dashed to the door and stopped short in a full gallop; as a bit of staccato

equestrianism it was superb.


And then the wherefore of all this dashing horsemanship, this curveting,

prancing, galloping revival of knightly tourney effects was

apparent—Judith Rodney had opened post-office. She had changed her riding

clothes; or, rather, that portion of them to which the ladies took exception

was now concealed by a long, black skirt. Her wonderful braids of black hair

had been twisted high on her head. She was well worth a trip across the alkali

wastes to see. The room was packed with men. One unconsciously got the

impression that a fire, a fight, or some crowd-collecting casualty had

happened. Above the continual clinking of spurs there arose every idiom and

peculiarity of speech of which these United States are capable. There is no

Western dialect, properly speaking. Men bring their modes of expression with

them from Maine or Minnesota, as the case may be, but their figures of speech,

which give an essential picturesqueness to their language, are almost entirely

local—the cattle and sheep industries, prospecting, the Indians, poker,

faro, the dance-halls, all contribute their printable or unprintable

embellishment.


Judith managed them all—cow-punchers, sheep-herders, prospectors,

freighters—with an impersonal skill that suggested a little solitary

exercise in the bowling-alley. The ten-pins took their tumbles in good

part—no one could congratulate himself on escaping the levelling

ball—and where there’s a universal lack of luck, doubtless also

there will be found a sort of grim fellowship.


That they were all more or less in love with her there could be no doubt. As a

matter of fact, Judith Rodney did not depend on the scarcity of women in the

desert for her pre-eminence in the interests of this hot-headed group. Her

personality—and through no conscious effort of hers—would have been

pre-eminent anywhere. As it was, in this woman-forsaken wilderness she might

have stirred up a modern edition of the Trojan war at any moment. That she did

not, despite the lurking suggestion of temptation written all over her, brought

back the words of Leander: “If Judy wasn’t a good girl, these boys

would just nacherally become extinct shooting each other upon account of

her.”


And yet what a woman she was! It struck Miss Carmichael, as she watched Judith

hold these warring elements in the hollow of her hand, that her interest might

be due to a certain temperamental fusion; that there might lie, at the essence

of her being, a subtle combination of saint and devil. One could fancy her

leading an army on a crusade or provoking a bar-room brawl. The challenging

quality of her beauty, the vividness of color, the suggestion of endurance and

radiating health in every line, were comparable to the great primeval forces

about her. She was cast to be the mother of men of brawn and muscle, who would

make this vast, unclaimed wilderness subject to them.


At present neither pole of her character, as it had been hastily estimated, was

even remotely suggested. The atmosphere in the post-office was, considering the

potential violence of its visitors, singularly calm. And Judith, feeding these

wild border lads on scraps of chaff and banter, and retaining their absolute

loyalty, was a sight worth seeing. She had the alertness of a lion-tamer locked

in a cage with the lords of the jungle; the rashly confident she humbled, the

meek she exalted, and all with such genuine good-fellowship, such an absence of

coquetry in the genial game of give and take, that one ceased to wonder at even

the devotion of Leander. And since they were to her, on her own confession, but

“spurs and sombreros,” one wondered at the elaboration of the

comedy, the endless wire-pulling in the manipulation of these most picturesque

marionettes—until one remembered the outlaw brother and felt that what

she did she did for him.


“You right shore there ain’t a letter for me, Miss Judith. My

creditors are pretty faithful ’bout bearing me in mind.” It was the

third time that the big, shambling Texan who had been one of the company at

Mrs. Clark’s eating-house had inquired for mail, and seemed so

embarrassed by his own bulk that he moved cautiously, as if he might step on a

fellow-creature and maim him. Each time he had asked for a letter he took his

place at the end of the waiting-line and patiently bided his time for the

chance of an extra word with the postmistress.


“They’ve begun to lose hope, Texas.”


She shuffled the letters impartially, as a goddess dispensing fate, and barely

glanced at the man who had ridden a hundred and fifty miles across sand and

cactus to see her.


“That’s the difference between them and me.” There was a grim

finality in his tone.


“What, you’re going to take your place at the end of that line

again! I’ll try and find you a circular.”


He tried to look at her angrily, but she smiled at him with such

good-fellowship that he went off singing significantly that universal anthem of

the cow-puncher the West over:


“Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie,

    In a narrow grave just six by three,

    Where the wild coyotes will howl o’er me.

Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.”


“Ain’t there a love letter for me?” The young man who

inquired seemed to belong to a different race from these bronzed squires of the

saddle. He suggested over-crowded excursion boats on Sunday afternoons in

swarming Eastern cities. He buttonholed every one and explained his presence in

the West on the score of his health, as though leaving his native asphalt were

a thing that demanded apology.


“Yes,” answered the postmistress, with a real motherly note,

“here is one from Hugous & Co.”


A roar went up at this, and the blushing tenderfoot pocketed his third bill for

the most theatrical style of Mexican sombrero; it had a brass snake coiled

round the crown for a hat-band, and a cow-puncher in good and regular standing

would have preferred going bareheaded to wearing it.


“She seems to be pressing her suit, son; you better name the day,”

one of the loungers suggested.


“The blamed thing ain’t worth twenty-five dollars,” the young

man from the East declared. A conspicuous silence followed. It seemed to

irritate the owner of the hat that no one would defend it. “It

ain’t worth it,” he repeated.


“I think you allowed you was out here for your health?” the big

Texan, who had returned from the corral, inquired.


“Betcher life,” swaggered the man with the hat,

“N’York’s good enough for me.”


“But”—and the Texan smiled sweetly—“the man who

sold you the hat ain’t out here for his.”


Judith hid her head and stamped letters. The boys were suspiciously quiet, then

some one began to chant:


“The devil examined the desert well,

And made up his mind ’twas too dry for hell;

He put up the prices his pockets to swell,

And called it a—heal-th resort.”


The postmistress waited for the last note of the chorus to die away, and read

from a package she held in her hand—“‘Mrs. Henry Lee, Deer

Lodge, Wyoming.’ Well, Henry, here’s a wedding-present, I guess.

And my congratulations, though you’ve hardly treated us well in never

saying a word.”


The unfortunate Henry, who hadn’t even a sweetheart, and who was noted as

the shyest man in the “Goose Creek Outfit,” had to submit to the

mock congratulations of every man in the room and promise to set up the drinks

later.


“I never felt we’d keep you long, son; them golden curls seldom

gets a chance to ripen singly.”


“Shoshone squaw, did you say she was, Henry? They ain’t much for

looks, but there’s a heep of wear to ’em.”


“Oh, go on, now; you fellows know I ain’t married.” And the

boy handled the package with a sort of dumb wonder, as if the superscription

were indisputable evidence of a wife’s existence.


“Open it, Henry; you shore don’t harbor sentiments of curiosity

regarding the post-office dealings of your lady.”


“Now, old man, this here may be grounds for divorce.”


“See what the other fellow’s sending your wife.”


Henry, badgered, jostled, the target of many a homely witticism, finally opened

the package, which proved to be a sample bottle of baby food. At sight of it

they howled like Apaches, and Henry was again forced to receive their

congratulations. Judith, who had been an interested on-looker without joining

in the merriment, now detected in the tenor of their humor a tendency towards

breadth. In an instant her manner was official; rapping the table with her

mailing-stamp, she announced:


“Boys, this post-office closes in ten minutes, if you want to buy any

stamps.”


The silence following this statement on the part of the postmistress was

instantaneous. Henry took his mirth-provoking package and went his way; some of

the more hilariously inclined followed him. The remainder confined themselves

absolutely to business, scrawling postal-cards or reading their mail. The

pounce of the official stamp on the letters, as the postmistress checked them

off for the mail-bag, was the only sound in the hot stillness.


A heavily built man, older than those who had been keeping the post-office

lively, now took advantage of the lull to approach Judith. He had a twinkling

face, all circles and pouches, but it grew graver as he spoke to the

postmistress. He was Major Atkins, formerly a famous cavalry officer, but since

his retirement a cattle-man whose herds grazed to the pan-handle of Texas. As

he took his mail, talking meantime of politics, of the heat, of the lack of

water, in the loud voice for which he was famous, he managed, with clumsy

diplomacy, to interject a word or two for her own ear alone.


“Jim’s out,” he conveyed to her, in a successfully muffled

tone. “He’s out, and they’re after him, hot. Get him out of

the State, Judy—get him out, quick. He tried to kill Simpson at Mrs.

Clark’s, in town, yesterday. The little Eastern girl that’s here

will tell you.” Then the major was gone before Judith could perfectly

realize the significance of what he had told her.


She threw back her head and the pulse in her throat beat. Like a wild forest

thing, at the first warning sound, she considered: Was it time for

flight?—or was the warning but the crackling of a twig? Major Atkins was

a cattle-man: her brother hated all cattle-men. How disinterested had been the

major’s warning! He had always been her friend. Mrs. Atkins had been one

of the ladies at the post who had helped to send her to school to the nuns at

Santa Fé. She despised herself for doubting; yet these were troublous times,

and all was fair between sheep and cattle-men. Major Atkins had spoken of the

Eastern girl; then that pretty, little, curly-haired creature, whom Judith had

found standing in the sunshine, had seen Jim—had heard him threaten to

kill. Should she ask her about it—consult her? Judith’s training

was not one to impel her to give her confidence to strangers, still she had

liked the little Eastern girl.


These were the perplexities that beset her, sweeping her thoughts hither and

thither, as sea-weed is swept by the wash of the waves. She strove to collect

her faculties. How should she rid the house of her cavaliers? She had regularly

to refuse some half-dozen of them each day that she kept post-office.


In a few minutes more the group in the post-office began to disperse under the

skilful manipulation of the postmistress. To some she sold stamps with an air

of “God speed you,” and they were soon but dwindling specks on the

horizon. To others she implied such friendly farewells that there was nothing

to do but betake themselves to their saddles. Others had compromised with the

saloon opposite, and their roaring mirth came in snatches of song and shouts of

laughter. She fastened up the little pile of letters that had remained uncalled

for with what seemed a deliberate slowness. Each time any one entered the room

she looked up—then the hope died hard in her face. Leander came in with

catlike tread and removed the pigeon-holes from the table. The post-office was

closed. Family life had been resumed at the Daxes’.


Judith left the room and stood in the blinding sunlight, basking in it as if

she were cold. The mercury must have stood close to a hundred, and she was

hatless. There was no trace of her ebullient spirits of the morning. Her head

was sunk on her breast and she held her hands with locked fingers behind her.

It was hot, hot as the breaths of a thousand belching furnaces. A white,

burning glare had spread itself from horizon to horizon, and the earth wrinkled

and cracked beneath it. From every corner of this parched wilderness came an

ominous whirring, like the last wheezing gasp of an alarm-clock before striking

the hour. This menacing orchestration was nothing more or less than millions of

grasshoppers rasping legs and wings together in hoarse appreciation of the heat

and glare; but it had a sound that boded evil. Again and again she turned

towards the yellow road as it dipped over the hills; but there was never a

glimpse of a horseman from that direction.


V.

The Trail Of Sentiment


Within the house the travellers had disposed themselves in a repressed and

melancholy circle that suggested the suspended animation of a funeral

gathering. The fat lady had turned back her skirt to save her travelling dress.

The stage was late, and there was no good and sufficient reason for wearing it

out. A similar consideration of economy led her to flirt off flies with her

second best pocket-handkerchief. Mrs. Dax presided over the gathering with

awful severity. Every one truckled to her shamefully, receiving her lightest

remarks as if they were to be inscribed on tablets of bronze. Leander, his eyes

bright with excitement at being received in the family circle on an equal

footing, balanced perilously on the edge of his chair, anticipating dismissal.


“Chugg’s never ben so late as this,” said Mrs. Dax, rocking

herself furiously. She strongly resembled one of those mottled chargers of the

nursery whose flaunting nostrils seem forever on the point of sending forth

flame. Leander, the fat lady, and Miss Carmichael meekly murmured assent and

condemnation.


“And there ain’t a sign of him,” said Mrs. Dax, returning to

the house after straining the landscape through her all-observant eye, and not

detecting him in any of the remote pin-pricks on the horizon, in which these

plainsfolk invariably decipher a herd of antelope, an elk or two, or a

horseman.


“Bet he had a woman in the stage and upset it with her,” said

Leander, in the animated manner of a poor relation currying favor with a bit of

news.


Mrs. Dax regarded him severely for a moment, then conspicuously addressed her

next remark to the ladies. “Bet he had a woman in the stage, the old

scoundrel!”


“Wonder who she was?” said Leander, with the sparkling triumph of a

poor relation whose surmise had been accepted. But Mrs. Dax had evidently

decided that Leander had gone far enough.


“Was you expectin’ any of your lady friends by Chugg’s stage

that you are so frettin’ anxious?” she inquired, and the poor

relation collapsed miserably.


“You’ve heard about Chugg’s goin’ on since

‘Mountain Pink’ jilted him?” inquired Mrs. Dax of the fat

lady, as the only one of the party who might have kept abreast with the social

chronicles of the neighborhood.


“My land, yes,” responded the fat lady, proud to be regarded as

socially cognizant. “M’ son says he’s plumb locoed about

it—didn’t want me to travel by his stage. But I said he dassent

upset a woman of my age—he just nacherally dassent!”


Miss Carmichael, by dint of patient inquiry, finally got the story which was

popularly supposed to account for the misdemeanors of the stage-driver,

including his present delinquency that was delaying them on their journey.


It appeared that Lemuel Chugg, then writhing in the coils of perverse romance,

was among the last of those famous old stage-drivers whose talents combined

skill at handling the ribbons with the diplomacy necessary to treat with a

masked envoy on the road. His luck in these encounters was proverbial, and many

were the hair-breadth escapes due to Chugg’s ready wit and quick aim;

and, to quote Leander, “while he had been shot as full of holes as a

salt-shaker, there was a lot of fight in the old man yet.”


Chugg had had no loves, no hates, no virtues, no genial vices after the manner

of these frontiersmen. Avarice had warmed the cockles of his heart, and the

fetish he prayed to was an old gray woollen stocking, stuffed so full of

twenty-dollar gold pieces that it presented the bulbous appearance of the

“before treatment” view of a chiropodist’s sign. This darling

of his old age had been waxing fat since Chugg’s earliest manhood. It had

been his only love—till he met Mountain Pink.


Mountain Pink’s husband kept a road-ranch somewhere on Chugg’s

stage-route. She was of a buxom type whose red-and-white complexion had not yet

surrendered to the winds, the biting dust, and the alkali water. Furthermore,

she could “bring about a dried-apple pie” to make a man forget the

cooking of his mother. Great was the havoc wrought by Mountain Pink’s

pies and complexion, but she followed the decorous precedent of Cæsar’s

wife, and, like her pastry, remained above suspicion.


Her husband, whose name was Jim Bosky, seemed, to the self-impanelled jury that

spent its time sitting on the case, singularly insensible to his own

advantages. Not only did he fail to take a proper pride in her beauty, but

there were dark hints abroad that he had never tasted one of her pies. When

delicately questioned on this point, at that stage of liquid refreshment that

makes these little personalities not impossible, Bosky had grimly quoted the

dearth of shoes among shoe-makers’ children.


Whatever were the facts of the case, Mountain Pink got the sympathy that might

have been expected in a section of the country where the ratio of the sexes is

fifty to one. Chugg, eating her pies regularly once a week on his stage-route,

said nothing, but he presented her with a red plush photograph album with

oxidized silver clasps, and by this first reckless expenditure of money in the

life of Chugg, Natrona, Johnson, Converse, and Sweetwater counties knew that

Cupid had at last found a vulnerable spot in the tough and weather-tanned hide

of the old stage-driver.


Nor did Cupid stop here with his pranks. Having inoculated the stage-driver

with the virus of romance, madness began to work in the veins of Chugg. He

presented Mountain Pink with the gray woollen stocking—not extracting a

single coin—and urged her to get a divorce from the clodlike man who had

never appreciated her and marry him.


Mountain Pink coyly took the stocking so generously given for the divorce and

subsequent trousseau, and Chugg continued to drive his stage with an

Apollo-like abandon, whistling love-songs the while.


Coincident with Mountain Pink’s disappearance Dakotaward, in the

interests of freedom, went also one Bob Catlin, a mule-wrangler. Bosky, with

conspicuous pessimism, hoped for the worst from the beginning, and as time went

on and nothing was heard of either of the wanderers, some of Mountain

Pink’s most loyal adherents confessed it looked “romancy.”

But crusty old Chugg remained true to his ideal. “She’ll write when

she gets good and ready,” and then concluded, loyally, “Maybe she

can’t write, nohow,” and nothing could shake his faith.


When Mountain Pink and the mule-wrangler returned as bride and groom and set up

housekeeping on the remainder of Chugg’s stocking, and on his

stage-route, too, so that he had to drive right past the honeymoon cottage

every time he completed the circuit, they lost caste in Carbon County. Chugg

never spoke of the faithlessness of Mountain Pink. His bitterness found vent in

tipping over the stage when his passengers were confined to members of the

former Mrs. Bosky’s sex, and, as Leander said, “the flask in his

innerds held more.” And these were the only traces of tragedy in the life

of Lemuel Chugg, stage-driver.


Judith had continued her unquiet pacing in the blinding glare while the group

within doors, somnolent from the heat and the incessant shrilling of the

locusts, droningly discussed the faithlessness of Mountain Pink, dozed, and

took up the thread of the romance. Each time she turned Judith would stop and

scan the yellow road, shading her eyes with her hand, and each time she had

turned away and resumed her walk. Mary, who gave the postmistress no unstinted

share of admiration for the courage with which she faced her difficulties, and

who had been seeking an opportunity to signify her friendship, and now that she

saw the last of the gallants depart, inquired of Judith if she might join her.


They walked without speaking for several minutes, enjoying a sense of

comradeship hardly in keeping with the brevity of their acquaintance; a freedom

from restraint spared them the necessity of exchanging small-talk, that

frequently irritating toll exacted as tribute to possible friendship.


The desert lay white and palpitating beneath the noonday glare, and from the

outermost rim of desolation came dancing “dust-devils” whirling and

gliding through the mazes of their eerie dance. “I think

sometimes,” said Judith, “that they are the ghosts of those who

have died of thirst in the desert.”


Mary shuddered imperceptibly. “How do you stand it with never a glimpse

of the sea?”


“You’ll love it, or hate it; the desert is too jealous for half

measures. As for the sea”—Judith shrugged her fine

shoulders—“from all I’ve heard of it, it must be very

wet.”


Each felt a reticence about broaching the subject uppermost in her

thoughts—Judith from the instinctive tendency towards secretiveness that

was part of the heritage of her Indian blood; Mary because the subject so

closely concerned this girl for whom she felt such genuine admiration.


Judith finally brought up the matter with an abruptness that scarce concealed

her anxiety.


“You saw my brother yesterday at Mrs. Clark’s eating-house; will

you be good enough to tell me just what happened?”


Mary related the incident in detail, Judith cross-examining her minutely as to

the temper of the men at table towards Jim. Did she know if any cattle-men were

present? Did she hear where her brother had gone?


Mary had heard nothing further after he had left the eating-house; the only one

she had talked to had been Mrs. Clark, whose sympathy had been entirely with

Jim. Judith thanked her, but in reality she knew no more now than she had heard

from Major Atkins.


Judith now stopped in their walk and stood facing the road as it rolled over

the foot-hills—a skein of yellow silk glimmering in the sun. Then Mary

saw that the object spinning across it in the distance, hardly bigger than a

doll’s carriage, was the long-delayed stage. She spoke to the

postmistress, but apparently she did not hear—Judith was watching the

nearing stage as if it might bring some message of life and death. She stood

still, and the drooping lines of her figure straightened, every fibre of her

beauty kindled. She was like a flame, paling the sunlight.


And presently was heard the uncouth music of sixteen iron-shod hoofs beating

hard from the earth rhythmic notes which presently grew hollow and sonorous as

they came rattling over the wooden bridge that spanned the creek.


“Chugg!” exclaimed Leander, rushing to the door in a tumult. There

was something crucial in the arrival of the delayed stage-driver. His

delinquencies had deflected the course of the travellers, left them stranded in

a remote corner of the wilderness; but now they should again resume the thread

of things; Chugg’s coming was an event.


“’Tain’t Chugg, by God!” said Leander, impelled to

violent language by the unexpected.


“It’s Peter Hamilton!” exclaimed Mrs. Dax.


“Land’s sakes, the New-Yorker!” said the fat lady. Only

Judith said nothing.


Mr. Hamilton held the ribbons of that battered prairie-stage as if he had been

driving past the judges’ bench at the Horse Show. Furthermore, he wore

blue overalls, a flannel shirt, and a sombrero, which sartorial inventory,

while it highly became the slim young giant, added an extra comedy touch to his

rôle of whip. He was as dusty as a miller; close-cropped, curly head, features,

and clothes were covered with a fine alkali powdering; but he carried his youth

as a banner streaming in the blue. And he swung from the stage with the easy

flow of muscle that is the reward of those who live in the saddle and make a

fine art of throwing the lariat.


They greeted him heartily, all but Judith, who did not trust herself to speak

to him before the prying eyes of Mrs. Dax, and escaped to the house.

Chugg’s latest excursion into oblivion had resulted in a fall from the

box. He was not badly hurt, and recuperation was largely a matter of

“sleeping it off,” concluded Peter Hamilton’s bulletin of the

condition of the stage-driver. So the travellers were still marooned at

Dax’s, and the prospect of continuing their journey was as vague as ever.


“Last I heard of you,” said Mrs. Dax to Hamilton, with a sort of

stone-age playfulness, “you was punching cows over to the Bitter

Root.”


“That’s true, Mrs. Dax”—he gave her his most winning

smile—“but I could not stay away from you long.”


Leander grimaced and rubbed his hands in an ecstasy of delight at finding a man

who had the temerity to bandy words with Mrs. Dax.


“Hum-m-m-ph!” she whinnied, with equine coquetry. “Guess it

was rustlers brought you back as much as me.”


Judith, who had entered the room in time to hear Mrs. Dax’s last remark,

greeted him casually, but her eyes, as they met his, were full of questioning

fear. Had he come from the Bitter Root range to hunt down her brother? The

thought was intolerable. Yet, when he had bade her good-bye some three weeks

ago, he had told her that he did not expect to return much before the fall

“round-up.” She had heard, a day or two before, that he was again

in the Wind River country, and her morning vigil beneath the glare of the

desert sun had been for him.


Mrs. Dax regarded them with the mercilessness of a death-watch; she remembered

the time when Hamilton’s excuses for his frequent presence at the

post-office had been more voluble than logical. But now he no longer came, and

Judith, for all her deliberate flow of spirits, did not quite convince the

watchful eyes of Leander’s lady—the postmistress was a trifle too

cheerful.


“Mrs. Dax,” pleaded Peter, boyishly, “I’m perishing for

a cup of coffee, and I’ve got to get back to my outfit before

dark.”


“Oh, go on with you,” whinnied the gorgon; but she left the room to

make the coffee.


Judith’s eyes sought his. “Why don’t you and Leander form a

coalition for the overthrow of the enemy?” His voice had dropped a tone

lower than in his parley with Mrs. Dax; it might have implied special devotion,

or it might have implied but the passing tribute to a beautiful woman in a

country where women were few—the generic admiration of all men for all

women, ephemerally specialized by place and circumstance.


But Judith, harassed at every turn, heart-sick with anxiety, had anticipated in

Peter’s coming, if not a solution of her troubles, at least some evidence

of sustaining sympathy, and was in no mood for resuscitating the perennial

pleasantries anent Leander and his masterful lady.


The shrilling of the locusts emphasized their silence. She spoke to him

casually of his change of plan, but he turned the subject, and Judith let the

matter drop. She was too simple a woman to stoop to oblique measures for the

gaining of her own ends. If he was here to hunt down her brother, if he was

here to see the Eastern woman at the Wetmore ranch—well, “life was

life,” to be taken or left. Thus spoke the fatalism that was the heritage

of her Indian blood.


The thought of Miss Colebrooke at Wetmore’s reminded her of a letter for

Peter that had been brought that morning by one of the Wetmore cow-boys.


“I forgot—there’s a letter for you.” She went to the

pigeon-holes on the wall that held the flotsam and jetsam of unclaimed mail,

and brought him a square, blue linen envelope—distinctly a lady’s

letter.


Peter took it with rather a forced air of magnanimity, as if in neglecting to

present it to him sooner she drew heavily on his reserve of patience. Tearing

open the envelope, he read it voraciously, read it to the exclusion of his

surroundings, the world at large, and—Judith. He strode up and down the

floor two or three times, and called to Leander, who was passing:


“Dax, I must have that gray mare of yours right away.” He went in

the direction of the stable, without a second glance at the postmistress, and

presently they saw him galloping off in the opposite direction from which he

had come. Mrs. Dax came in with a tray on which were a pot of coffee and sundry

substantial delicacies.


“Where’s he gone?” she demanded, putting the tray down so

hard that the coffee slopped.


“I dunno,” said Leander. “He said he’d got to have the

gray mare, saddled her hisself, and rode off like hell.”


Mrs. Dax looked at them all savagely for the explanation that they could not

give. In sending her out to make coffee she felt that Peter, whom she regarded

in the light of a weakness, had taken advantage of her affections to dupe her

in regard to his plans.


“Take them things back to the kitchen,” she commanded Leander.


Mary Carmichael involuntarily glanced at Judith; the fall of the leaf was in

her cheek.


Peter Hamilton, bowed in his saddle and flogging forward inhumanely, bred rife

speculation as to his destination among the group that watched him from the

Daxes’ front door. Mrs. Dax, who entertained so profound a respect for

her own omniscience that she disdained to arrive at a conclusion by a logical

process of deduction, was “plumb certain that he had gone after

‘rustlers!’” Leander, who had held no opinions since his

marriage except that first and all-comprehensive tenet of his creed—that

his wife was a person to be loved, honored, and obeyed instantly—agreed

with his lady by a process of reflex action. The fat lady, who had a

commonplace for every occasion, didn’t “know what we were all

coming to.” Miss Carmichael, who was beginning to find her capacity for

amazement overstrained, alone accepted this last incident with apathy. Mr.

Hamilton might have gone in swift pursuit of cattle thieves or he might be

riding the mare to death for pure whimsy. Only Judith Rodney, who said nothing,

felt that he was spurring across the wilderness at breakneck speed to see a

girl at Wetmore’s. But her lack of comment caused no ripple of surprise

in the flow of loose-lipped speculation that served, for the time being, to

inject a casual interest into the talk of these folk, bored to the verge of

demoralization by long waiting for Chugg.


Judith preferred to confirm her apprehensions regarding Hamilton’s ride,

alone. She knew—had not all her woman’s intuitions risen in

clamorous warning—and yet she hoped, hoped despairingly, even though the

dread alternative to the girl at the Wetmore ranch threatened lynch law for her

brother. Her very gait changed as she withdrew from the group about the door,

covertly gaining her vantage-ground inch by inch. The heels of her riding-boots

made no sound as she stole across the kitchen floor, toeing in like an Indian

tracking an enemy through the forest. The small window at the back of the

kitchen commanded a view of the road in all its sprawling circumlocution. Seen

from this prospect, it had no more design than the idle scrawlings of a child

on a bit of paper; but the choice of roads to Good and Evil was not fraught

with more momentous consequences than was each prong of that fork towards which

Hamilton was galloping.


The right arm swung towards the Wetmore ranch, where at certain times during

the course of the year a hundred cow-punchers reported on the stock that grazed

in four States. At certain seasons, likewise, despite the fact that the ranch

was well into the foot-hill country, there might be found a New York family

playing at life primeval with the co-operation of porcelain bath-tubs, a French

chef, and electric light.


The left fork of the road had a meaner destiny. It dipped straight into

desolation, penetrating a naked wilderness where bad men skulked till the evil

they had done was forgotten in deeds that called afresh to Heaven for

vengeance. It was well away on this west fork of the road that they lynched

Kate Watson—“Cattle Kate”—for the crime of loyalty. It

was she, intrepid and reckless, who threatened the horde of masked scoundrels

when they came to lynch her man for the iniquity of raising a few vegetables on

a strip of ground that cut into their grazing country. And when she,

recognizing them, masked though they were, threatened them with the vengeance

of the law, they hanged her with her man high as Haman.


Judith watched Hamilton with narrowing eyes. And now she was all Indian, the

white woman in her dead. Only the Sioux watched, and, in the patient, Indian

style, bided its time. “Cattle thieves,” “the girl at

Wetmore’s”—the words sang themselves in her head like an

incantation. “Cattle thieves” meant her brother, their recognized

leader—her brother, who was dearer to her than the heart in her breast,

the eye in her head, the right hand that held together the shambling, uncertain

destiny of her people. Would he turn to the left, Justice, on a pale horse,

hunting her brother gallowsward? Would he turn towards the right, the impetuous

lover spurring his steed that he might come swiftly to the woman. A pulse in

her bosom rose slowly until her breath was suspended, then fell again; she was

still watching, without an outward quiver, long after he had turned to the

right—and the woman.


VI.

A Daughter Of The Desert


Judith knew that the name of the girl whose letter sent Peter Hamilton vaulting

to the saddle was Katherine Colebrooke. There had been a deal of letter-writing

between her and the young cow-puncher of late, of which perforce, by a singular

irony of fate, the postmistress had been the involuntary instrument. The

correspondence had followed a recent hasty journey to New York, undertaken

somewhat unwillingly by Hamilton in the interest of certain affairs connected

with the settlement of an estate.


The precipitancy of this latest turn of events bewildered Judith; but yet a

little while—a matter of weeks and days—and her friendship with

Hamilton had been of that pleasantly indefinite estate situated somewhere on

the borderland of romance, a kingdom where there is no law but the mutual

interest of the wayfarers. Judith and Peter had been pitifully new at the game

of life when the gods vouchsafed them the equivocal blessing of propinquity.

Judith was but lately come from the convent at Santa Fé, and Hamilton from the

university whose honors availed him little in the trailing of cattle over the

range or in the sweat and tumult of the branding-pen. It was a strange election

of opportunity for a man who had been class poet and had rather conspicuously

avoided athletics during his entire college course. In pursuing fortune

westward Hamilton did not lack for chroniclers who would not have missed a good

story for the want of an authentic dramatic interpretation of his plans. His

uncle, said they, who had put him through college, was disposed to let him sink

or swim by his own efforts; or, again, he had quarrelled with this same

omnipotent uncle and walked from his presence with no prospects but those

within grasp of his own hand. Again, he had taken the negative of a fair lady

more to heart than two-and-twenty is in the habit of taking negatives. Peter

made no confidences. He went West to punch cows for the Wetmore outfit; he was

a distant connection of the Wetmores through his mother’s side of the

family.


In those days Peter wore his rue—whether for lady fair or for towering

prospects stricken down—with a tinge of wan melancholy not unbecoming to

a gentle aquilinity of profile, softened by the grace of adolescence. His

instinctive aristocracy of manners and taste would have availed him little with

his new associates had he been a whit less manly. But as he shirked no part of

the universal hardship, they left him his reticence. He even came to enjoy a

sort of remote popularity as one who was conversant with the best—a

nonchalant social connoisseur—yet who realized the stern primitive

beauties of the range life.


Judith’s convent upbringing had conferred on her the doubtful advantage

of a gentlewoman’s tastes and bearing, making of her, therefore, an alien

in her father’s house. When Mrs. Atkins, who was responsible for her

education, realized the equivocal good of these things, and saw moreover that

the girl had grown to be a beauty, she offered to adopt her; but Judith, with

the pitiful heroism of youth that understands little of what it is renouncing,

thought herself strong enough to hold together a family, uncertain of purpose

as quicksilver.


In those tragic days of readjustment came Peter Hamilton, as strange to the

bald conditions of frontier life as the girl herself. From the beginning there

had been between them the barrier of circumstance. Hamilton was poor, Judith

the mainstay of a household whose thriftlessness had become a proverb. He came

of a family that numbered a signer of the Declaration of Independence, a famous

chief-justice, and the dean of a great university; Judith was uncertain of her

right to the very name she bore. And yet they were young, he a man, she a

woman—eternal fountain of interest. A precocious sense of the fitness of

things was the compass that enabled Peter to steer through the deep waters in

the years that followed. But the girl paid the penalty of her great heart; in

that troublous sea of friendship, she was soon adrift without rudder, sail, or

compass.


Judith was now eight-and-twenty, and a sculptor would have found a hundred

statues in her. Long of limb, deep-bosomed, youth and health radiated from her

as sparks fly upward. In sunlight, her black hair had the bluish iridescence of

a ripe plum. The eyes were deep and questioning—the eyes of a young

seraph whose wings had not yet brushed the far distant heights of paradise.

Again, in her pagan gladness of living, she might have been a Valkyr come down

from Valhalla on a shooting-star. And yet, in this wilderness that was

famishing for woman’s love and tears and laughter, by a very perversity

of fate she walked alone.


She was a true daughter of the desert, the child of stark, unlovely

circumstance. No well-bred romance of book and bells and churchly benediction

had ushered her into being. Her maternal grandfather had been the famous Sioux

chief, Flying Hawk; her grandmother, a white woman, who knew no word of her

people’s tongue, nor yet her name or race. The Indians found the white

baby sleeping by her dead mother after the massacre of an emigrant train. They

took her with them and she grew up, in the Black Hill country, a white-skinned

Sioux, marrying a chief of the people that had slain her people. She accepted

her squaw’s portion uncomplainingly; slaved cheerfully at squaw’s

work while her brave made war on the whites, hunted, and smoked. She reared her

half-breed children in the legends of their father’s people, and died, a

withered crone, cursing the pale-faces who had robbed the Sioux of the buffalo

and their hunting-ground.


Her daughter, Singing Stream, who knew no word of English, but who could do

better bead-work than any squaw in the tribe, went to live with Warren Rodney

when he finished his cabin on Elder Creek. That was before the gold fever

reached the Black Hills, and Rodney built the cabin that he might fish and hunt

and forget the East and why he left it. There were reasons why he wanted to

forget his identity as a white man in his play at being an Indian. In the first

flare of youth and the joy of having come into her woman’s kingdom, the

half-breed squaw was pretty; she was proud, too, of her white man, the house he

had built her, and the girl pappoose with blue eyes. Furthermore, she had been

taught to serve man meekly, for he was the lord of creation.


Rodney talked Sioux to her. He had all but forgotten he was a white man. The

girl pappoose ran about the cabin, brown and bare, but for the bead jacket

Singing Stream had made for her in the pride of her maternity. Rodney called

the little girl “Judith.” Her Indian mother never guessed the

significance of the strange name that she could not say, but made at least ten

soft singing syllables of, in the Indian way. The little Judith greeted her

father in strange lispings; Warren Rodney was far from unhappy in playing at

primitive man. This recessional into conditions primeval endured for

“seven snows,” as the Indian tongue hath it. Then the squaw began

to break, after the manner of the women of her father’s people. She had

begun her race with time a decade after Warren Rodney, and she had outdistanced

him by a decade.


And then the Tumlins came from Tennessee to the Black Hills. They came in an

ox-cart, and the days of their journey were more than two years. They had

stopped in Ohio, and again in Illinois; and, behold! neither was the promised

land, the land that their excited imaginations had painted from the large talk

of returning travellers, and that was further glorified through their own

thriftless discontent with conditions at home. They had travelled on and on

across half a continent in the wake of a vanishing sky-line. The vague westward

impulse was luring them to California, but they waited in Dakota that their

starved stock might fatten, and while they rested themselves from the long

journey, Warren Rodney made the acquaintance of Sally Tumlin, who rallied him

on being a “squaw man.”


Warren Rodney had almost forgotten the sorceries of the women of his people; he

had lived so long with a brown woman, who spread no silken snares.

Sally’s blushes stirred a multitude of dead things—the wiles of

pale women, all strength in weakness, fragile flowers for tender

handling—the squaw had grown as withered as a raisin.


Now, Sally Tumlin had no convictions about life but that the world owed her

“a home of her own.” Her mother had forged the bolt of this

particular maxim at an early date. And Sally saw from precocious observation

that the business of women was home-getting, to which end they must be neat and

sweet and sparing of speech. After the home was forthcoming, then, indeed,

might a woman take ease in slippers and wrapper, and it is surely a

wife’s privilege to speak her mind. Sally knew that she hated travelling

westward after the crawling oxen; each day the sun pursued them, caught up with

them, outdistanced them, and at night left them stranded in the wilderness, and

rose again and mocked them on the morrow. Her father and oafish brother loved

the makeshifts of the wagon life, with its chance shots at fleeing antelope,

scurrying sage-hens, and bounding cotton-tails; a chance parley with a stray

Indian but added zest to the game of chance. But Sally hated it all. The cabin

on Elder Creek had a tight roof; Warren Rodney had money in the bank. He had

had uncommon luck at trapping. His talk to Sally was largely of his prospects.


Sally knew that the world owed her “a home of her own”; and why

should she let a squaw keep her from it? Sally’s mother giggled when

consulted. She plainly regarded the squaw as a rival of her daughter. The

ethics of the case, as far as Mrs. Tumlin was concerned, was merely a question

of white skin against brown, and which should carry the day. Singing Stream

knew not one word of the talk, much of which occurred in her very presence,

that threatened to pull her home about her ears, but she knew that Sally was

taking her man from her. The white-skinned woman wore white ruffles about her

neck and calico dresses that were the color of the wild roses that grew among

the willows at the creek. Sally Tumlin’s pink calico gowns sowed a crop

of nettles in the mind of the squaw. It was the rainbow things, she felt, that

were robbing her of her man. All her barbaric craving for glowing colors

asserted itself as a means towards the one great end of keeping him. Singing

Stream began to scheme schemes. One day Rodney was splitting wood at the Tumlin

camp—though why he should split wood where there were two women puzzled

the squaw. But the ways of the pale-faces were beyond her ken. She only knew

that she must make herself beautiful in the eyes of Warren Rodney, like this

devil woman, and then perhaps the pappoose that she expected with the first

snowfall would be a man-child; and she hoped great things of this happening.


With such primitive reasoning did Singing Stream put the horses to the light

wagon, and, taking the little Judith with her, drove to Deadwood, a matter of

two hundred miles, to buy the bright calicoes that were to make her like a

white woman. It never occurred to the half-breed woman to make known her plans

to Warren Rodney. In circumventing Sally Tumlin the man became the spoils of

war, and it is not the Indian way to tell plans on the war-trail. So the squaw

left her kingdom in the hands of the enemy, without a word.


Sally Tumlin and Warren Rodney looked upon the disappearance of the squaw in

the light of a providential solution of the difficulties attending their

romance. They admitted it was square of her to “hit the trail,” and

they decided to lose no time in going to the army post, where a chaplain, an

Indian missionary, happened to be staying at the time, and have a real wedding,

with a ring and a fee to the parson. The wedding party started for the post,

old mother Tumlin fluttering about the bride as complacently as if the ceremony

had been the culmination of the most decorous courtship. The oafish brother

drove the bridal party, making crude jests by-the-way, to the frank delight of

the prospective groom and the giggling protestations of the bride. The chaplain

at the post was disposed to ask few questions. Parsons made queer marriages in

those tumultuous days, and it was regarded as a patent of worthy motives that

the pair should call in the man of the gospel at all. To the question whether

or not he had been married before, Rodney answered:


“Well, parson, this is the first time I have ever stood up for a life

sentence.” And the ceremony proceeded.


Some of the ladies at the post, hearing that there was to be a wedding, dropped

in and added their smiles and flutterings to the rather grim party; among them,

Mrs. Atkins, who had just come to the post as a bride. They even added a trifle

or two from their own store of pretty things, as presents to Sally. And Miss

Tumlin left the post Mrs. Warren Rodney, with “a home of her own”

to go to.


Singing Stream did not hasten in her quest for bright fabrics with which to

stay the hand of fate. To the half-breed woman the journey to town was not

without a certain revivifying pleasure. The Indian in her stirred to the call

of the open country. The tight roof to the cabin on Elder Creek had not the

attractions for her that it had for Sally Tumlin. She had chafed sometimes at a

house with four walls. But now the dead and gone braves rose in her as she

followed the old trail where they had so often crept to battle against their

old enemies, the Crows, before the white man’s army had scattered them.

And as she drove through the foot-hill country, she told the solemn-eyed little

Judith the story of the Sioux, and what a great fighting people they had been

before Rodney’s people drove them from their land. Judith was holding a

doll dressed exactly like herself, in soft buckskin shirt, little trousers, and

moccasins, all beautifully beaded. In her turn she told the story to the doll.


Singing Stream told her daughter of the making of the world, as the Sioux

believe the story of creation; of the “Four who Never

Die”—Sharper, or Bladder, Rabbit, Turtle, and Monster; likewise of

the coming of a mighty flood on which swam the Turtle and a water-fowl in whose

bill was the earth atom, from which presently the world began to grow, Turtle

supporting the bird on his great back, which was hard like rock. The rest of

the myth, that deals with the rising and setting of the sun, Singing Stream

could not tell her daughter, as the old Sioux chiefs did not think it wise to

let their women folk know too much about matters of theology. Nor did they

relate to squaws the sun myth, with its account of much cutting-off of

heads—thinking, perhaps, with wisdom, that these good ladies saw enough

of carnage in their every-day life without introducing it into their catechism.


But Singing Stream knew the story of “Sharper,” or

“Bladder,” as he is called by some of the people, because he is

round and his grotesquely fat figure resembles a bladder blown to bursting.

Bladder’s province it is to make a fool of himself, diving into water

after plums he sees reflected there from the branches of the trees. He dives

again and again in his pursuit of folly, even tying stones to his wrists and

ankles to keep himself down while he gathers the reflected fruit. After his

rescue, which he fights against valiantly, as he lies gasping on the bank of

the stream, he sees the fruit on the branches above his head. It is this same

Bladder who is one of the dramatis personæ in the moon myth, and that is told

to women as safely without the limits of that little learning that is a

dangerous thing. Bladder met Rabbit hunting; and Bladder kept throwing his eye

up into the tree-tops to look for game. The Rabbit watched him enviously,

thinking what a saving of effort it would be if he could do the same thing.

Wherefore Bladder promised to instruct him, telling him to change eyes after

using one four times, but Rabbit did not think that the first time counted, as

that was but a trial. So he lost his eye after throwing it up the fifth time.

And the eye of the rabbit is the moon, and the face seen in the full moon is

the reflection of the rabbit seen in his own eye as we see ourselves reflected

in the eye of a friend if we look closely. The little girl was wonderfully

impressed. She put her hand to her own eyes, but they were in tight, too tight

to throw up to the tree-tops.


Singing Stream also told little Judith that the Great Mystery had shown truths,

hid to man, to the trees, the streams, the hills; and the clouds that shaped

themselves, drifting hither and yon, were the Great Mystery’s passing

thoughts. But he had deprived all these things of speech, as he did not trust

them fully, and they could only speak to man in dreams, or in some passing

mood, when they could communicate to him the feeling of one of the Great

Spirits, and warn man of what was about to befall him. Judith was not quite

four when she took this memorable drive with her mother, but the impression of

these things abided through all her years. It was to the measureless spaces of

desert loneliness that she learned to bring her sorrows in the days of her arid

youth, and to feel a kinship with all its moods and to hear in the voice of its

silence a never-failing consolation.


And when they had come within a mile of Warren Rodney’s cabin on Elder

Creek, Singing Stream halted and prepared for the great event of reinstatement.

First she made a splendid toilet of purple calico torn into strips and tied

about the waist to simulate the skirts of the devil woman. Over these she wore

a shirt of buckskin, broidered with beads of many colors, and a necklace of elk

teeth, wound twice about the throat. On her feet she wore new moccasins of

tanned elk-hide, and these, too, were beaded in many colors. Her hair, now

braided with strips of scarlet flannel, hung below the waist. And she walked to

Rodney’s cabin, not as an outgrown mistress, but as the daughter of a

chief. The little Judith held up her head and clung tight to the doll. She knew

that something of moment was about to happen.


The gala trio, Singing Stream, Judith, and Judith’s doll, presented

themselves at Rodney’s house, before which the bride was washing clothes,

the day being fine. Sally, as usual, wore one of the rose-colored calicoes with

the collar turned well in and the sleeves rolled above the elbows. She washed

vigorously, with a steady splashing of suds. Sally enjoyed this home of her own

and all the household duties appertaining to it. She was singing, and a strand

of pale-brown hair, crinkly as sea-weed, had blown across the rose of her

cheek, when she felt rather than saw a shadow fall across her path, and,

glancing up, she saw facing her the woman whom she had supplanted, and the

solemn-eyed little girl holding tight to her doll. Now, neither woman knew a

word of the other’s speech, but Sally was proficient in the language of

femininity, and she was not at a loss to grasp the significance of the purple

calico, the beaded buckskin shirt, and the necklace of elk teeth. The

half-breed walked as a chief’s daughter to the woman at the tub, and

Sally grew sick and chill despite her white skin and the gold ring that made

Warren Rodney her man in the face of the law. The dark woman held Judith

proudly by the hand, as a sovereign might carry a sceptre. Judith was her staff

of office, her emblem of authority in the house of Warren Rodney.


Singing Stream held out her hands to Sally in a gesture of appeal—and

blundered. Of the chief’s daughter, walking proudly, Sally was afraid;

but a supplicating half-breed in strips of purple calico, not even hemmed, was

a matter for merriment. Sally put her hands on her hips, arms akimbo, and

laughed a dry cackle. The light in the brown woman’s eyes, as she looked

at the white, was like prairie-fires rolling forward through darkness. There

was no need of a common speech between them. The whole destiny of woman was in

the laugh and the look that answered it.


And the man they could have murdered for came from the house, an unheroic

figure with suspenders dangling and a corncob pipe in his mouth, sullen, angry,

and withal abjectly frightened, as mere man inevitably is when he sniffs a

woman’s battle in the air. The bride, at sight of her husband, took to

hysterics. She wept, she laughed, and down tumbled her hair. She felt the

situation demanded a scene. Rodney, with a marital brevity hardly to be

expected so soon, commanded Sally to go into the house and to “shut

up.”


Then he faced Singing Stream and said to her in her own language: “You

must go away from here. The pale-faced woman is my wife by the white

man’s law—ring and Bible. No Indian marriage about this.”


But the brown woman only pointed to Judith. She asked Rodney had she not been a

good squaw to him.


And Rodney, who at best was but a poltroon, could only repeat: “You got

to keep away from here. It’s the white man’s law—one squaw

for one man.”


From within came the sound of Sally’s lamentation as she called for her

father and brother to take her from the squaw and contamination. Warren Rodney

was a man of few words. It had become his unpleasant duty to act, and to act

quickly. He snatched Judith from her mother and took her into the house, and he

returned with his Winchester, which was not loaded, to Singing Stream.


“You got to go,” he said, and levelling the Winchester, he repeated

the command. Singing Stream looked at him with the dumb wonder of a forest

thing. “I was a good squaw to you,” she said; and did not even

curse him. And turning, she ran towards the foot-hills, with all the length of

purple calico trailing.


Now Mrs. Rodney, née Tumlin, was but human, and her cup of happiness as the

wife of a “squaw man” was not the brimming beaker she had

anticipated. The expulsion of her predecessor, at such a time, to make room for

her own home-coming, was, it seemed, open to criticism. “The

neighborhood”—it included perhaps five families living in a radius

of as many hundred miles—felt that the Tumlins had established a bad

precedent. A “squaw man” driving out a brown wife to make room for

a white is not a heroic figure. It had been done before, but it would not hand

down well in the traditions of the settling of this great country. Trespass of

law and order, with their swift, red-handed reckoning, were but moves of the

great game of colonization. But to shove out a brown woman for a white was a

mean move. Few stopped at the Rodneys’ ranch, though it marked the first

break in the journey from town to the gold-mining country. Rodney had fallen

from his estate as a pioneer; his political opinions were unsought in the

conclaves that sat and spat at the stove, when business brought them to the

joint saloon and post-office. The women dealt with the question more openly,

scorning feminine subtlety at this pass as inadequate ammunition. When they met

Mrs. Rodney they pulled aside their skirts and glared. This outrage against

woman it was woman’s work to settle.


Mrs. Rodney, who had no more moral sense than a rabbit, felt that she was the

victim of persecution. She knew she was a good woman. Hadn’t she a

husband? Had there ever been a word against her character? What was the use of

making all that fuss over a squaw? It was not as if she was a white woman. The

injustice of it preyed on the former Miss Tumlin. She took to the consolations

of snuff-dipping and fell from her pink-and-white estate.


The Tumlin family did not remain long enough in the Black Hill country to

witness Sally’s failure as the wife of a pioneer. The restlessness of the

“settler,” if the paradox be permissible, was in the marrow of

their bones. The makeshifts of the wagon, the adventures of the road, were the

only home they craved. The spring after Sally’s marriage they set forth

for California, the year following for New Mexico, and still sighed for new

worlds to visit. They were happier now that Sally, the one element of

discontent, had been removed from their perennial journeying by the merciful

dispensation of marriage. Old Tumlin, his wife, and the son gave themselves up

more than ever to the day-dreams of the road, the freedom of the open country,

and the spirit of adventure.


Rodney’s squaw wife was taken in by some neighbors, good folk who were

conversant with all phases of the romance. They stood by her in her hour of

trial, and afterwards continued to keep her as a servant. Her son Jim grew up

with their own children. When he was four years of age his mother, Singing

Stream, died, and Sally persuaded her husband to take young Jim into their own

home, partly as a sop to neighborly criticism, partly as a salve to her own

conscience. Sally had children of her own, and looked at things differently now

from the time when she fought the squaw for Rodney’s favor.


Jim’s foster-parents were, in truth, glad to part with him. From his

earliest babyhood he had been known as a “limb of Satan.” He was an

Ishmael by every instinct of his being. And Mrs. Warren Rodney, née Tumlin,

felt that in dealing with him, in her capacity of step-mother, she daily

expiated any offence that she might have done to his mother.


Sally grew slatternly with increasing maternity. She spent her time in a

rocking-chair, dipping snuff—a consolation imported from her former

home—and lamenting the bad marriage she had made. Rodney ascribed his

ill-fortune to unjust neighborly criticism. He farmed a little, he raised a

little stock, and he drank a great deal of whiskey. Sally hated the Black Hill

country. She felt that it knew too much about her. The neighborly inquisition

had fallen like a blight on the family fortunes. A vague migratory impulse was

on her. She wanted to go somewhere and begin all over again. By dint of

persistent nagging she persuaded her husband to move to Wyoming, then in the

golden age of the cattle industry. Those were days when steers, to speak in the

cow language, had “jumped to seventy-five.” The wilderness grew

light-headed with prosperity. Wonderful are the tales still told about those

fat years in cattle-land. It was in those halcyon days of the Cheyenne Club

that the members rode from the range, white with the dust of the desert, to

enjoy greater luxuries than those procurable at their clubs in New York.


Nor was it all feasting and merrymaking. A heroic band it was that battled with

the wilderness, riding the range with heat and cold, starvation and death, and

making small pin-pricks in that empty blotch of the United States map that is

marked “Great Alkali Desert” blossom into settlements. When the

last word has been said about the pioneers of these United States, let the

cow-boy be remembered in the universal toast, that bronzed son of the saddle

who lived his little day bravely and merrily, and whose real heroism is too

often forgotten in the glamour of his own picturesqueness.


Judith was ten years old when her father, his wife, and their children moved

from Dakota—they were not so particular about North and South Dakota, in

those days—to take up a claim on Sweetwater, Wyoming. Judith gave scant

promise of the beauty that in later life became at once her dower and her

misfortune, that which was as likely to bring wretchedness as happiness. In

Wyoming she was destined to find an old friend, Mrs. Atkins, who, as the bride

of the young lieutenant, had been present at the marriage of Sally Tumlin and

Warren Rodney, and who had always felt a wholly unreasonable sense of guilt at

witnessing the ceremony and contributing a lace handkerchief to the bride. Her

husband, now Major Atkins, was stationed at Fort Washakie, Wyoming. Mrs. Atkins

happening again on the Rodney family, and her husband having increased and

multiplied his army pay many times over by a successful venture in cattle, the

scheme of Judith’s convent education was put through by the major’s

wife, who had kept her New England conscience, the discomforts of frontier

posts notwithstanding.


So Judith went to the nuns to school, and stayed with them till she was

eighteen. Mrs. Atkins would have adopted her then; but Judith by this time knew

her family history in all its sordid ramifications, and felt that duty called

her to her brother, who had not improved his unfortunate start in life, though

his step-mother did not spoil him for the staying of the rod.


VII.

Chugg Takes The Ribbons


Chugg, comforted with liquids and stayed with a head-plaster, presented himself

at the Dax ranch just twenty-four hours after he was due. His mien combined

vagueness with hostility, and he harnessed up the stage that Peter Hamilton had

driven over the day before, when his prospective passengers were looking, with

a graphic pantomimic representation of “take it or leave it.” Under

the circumstances, Miss Carmichael and the fat lady consented to be passengers

with much the same feeling of finality that one might have on embarking for the

planet Mars in an air-ship.


There was, furthermore, a suggestion of last rites in the farewells of the

Daxes, each according to their respective personalities, that was far from

reassuring.


“Here’s some bread and meat and a bottle of cold coffee, if you

live to need it,” was Mrs. Dax’s grim prognostication of accident.

Leander, being of an emotional nature, could scarce restrain his

tears—the advent of the travellers had created a welcome variation in the

monotony of his dutiful routine—he felt all the agitation of parting with

life-long friends. Mary Carmichael and Judith promised to write—they had

found a great deal to say to each other the preceding evening.


Chugg cracked his whip ominously, the travellers got inside, not daring to

trust themselves to the box.


The journey with the misanthrope was but a repetition of that first day’s

staging—the sage-brush was scarcer, the mountains seemed as far off as

ever, and the outlook was, if possible, more desolate. The entry in Miss

Carmichael’s diary, inscribed in malformed characters as the stage jolted

over ruts and gullies, reads: “I do not mind telling you, in strictest

confidence, ‘Dere Diary’—as the little boy called

you—that when I so lightly severed my connection with civilization, I had

no idea to what an extent I was going in for the prairie primeval. How on earth

does a woman who can write a letter like Mrs. Yellett stand it? And where on

the map of North America is Lost Trail?”


“Land sakes!” regretted the fat lady, “but I do wish I had a

piece of that ‘boy’s favorite’ cake that I had for my lunch

the day we left town. I just ate and ate it ’cause I hadn’t another

thing to do. If I hadn’t been so greedy I could offer him a piece, just

to show him that some women folk have kind hearts, and that the whole sect

ain’t like that Pink.”


“Boy’s favorite,” as adequate compensation for shattered

ideals, a broken heart, and the savings of a lifetime, seemed to Mary

Carmichael inadequate compensation, but she forbore to express her sentiments.


The fat lady had never relaxed her gaze from Chugg’s back since the stage

had started. She peered at that broad expanse of flannel shirt through the tiny

round window, like a careful sailing-master sweeping the horizon for possible

storm-clouds. At every portion of the road presenting a steep decline she would

prod Chugg in the back with the handle of her ample umbrella, and demand that

he let her out, as she preferred walking. The stage-driver at first complied

with these requests, but when he saw they threatened to become chronic, he

would send his team galloping down grade at a rate to justify her liveliest

fears.


“Do you think you are a-picnicking, that you crave roominating round

these yere solitoodes?” And the misanthrope cracked his whip and adjured

his team with cabalistic imprecations.


“Did you notice if Mrs. Dax giv’ him any cold coffee, same as she

did us?” anxiously inquired the fat lady from her lookout.


Mary hadn’t noticed.


“He’s drinking something out of a brown bottle—seems to

relish it a heep more’n he would cold coffee,” reported the watch.

“Hi there! Hi! Mr. Chugg!” The stage-driver, thinking it was merely

a request to be allowed to walk, continued to drive with one hand and hold the

brown bottle with the other. But even his too solid flesh was not proof against

the continued bombardment of the umbrella handle.


“Um-m-m,” he grunted savagely, applying a watery eye to the round

window.


“Nothing,” answered the fat lady, quite satisfied at having her

worst fears confirmed.


Chugg returned to his driving, as one not above the weakness of seeing and

hearing things.


“’Tain’t coffee.”


“Could you smell it?” questioned Mary, anxiously.


“You never can tell that way, when they are plumb pickled in it, like

him.”


“Then how did you know it wasn’t coffee?”


“His eyes had fresh watered.”


Mary collapsed under this expert testimony. “What are we going to do

about it?”


“Appeal to him as a gentleman,” said the fat lady, not without

dramatic intonation.


“You appeal,” counselled Mary; “I saw him look at you

admiringly when you were walking down that steep grade.”


“Is that so?” said the fat lady, with a conspicuous lack of

incredulity; and she put her hand involuntarily to her frizzes.


This time she did not trust to the umbrella-handle as a medium of communication

between the stage-driver and herself. Putting her hand through the port-hole

she grasped Chugg’s arm—the bottle arm—with no uncertain

grip.


“Why, Mr. Chugg, this yere place is getting to be a regular summer

resort; think of two ladies trusting themselves to your protection and

travelling out over this great lonesome desert.”


Chugg’s mind, still submerged in local Lethe waters, grappled in silence

with the problem of the feminine invasion, and then he muttered to himself

rather than to the fat lady, “Nowhere’s safe from ’em; women

and house-flies is universally prevailing.”


The fat lady dropped his arm as if it had been a brand. “He’s no

gentleman. As for Mountain Pink, she was drove to it.”


All that day they toiled over sand and sage-brush; the sun hung like a molten

disk, paling the blue of the sky; the grasshoppers kept up their shrill

chirping—and the loneliness of that sun-scorched waste became a tangible

thing.


Chugg sipped and sipped, and sometimes swore and sometimes muttered, and as the

day wore on his driving not only became a challenge to the endurance of the

horses, but to the laws of gravitation. He lashed them up and down grade, he

drove perilously close to shelving declivities, and sometimes he sang, with

maudlin mournfulness:


“‘Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie.’

The words came low and mournfully

From the cold, pale lips of a youth who lay

On his dying couch at the close of day.”


The fat lady reminded him that he was a gentleman and that he was driving

ladies; she threatened him with her son on Sweetwater, who began, in the

maternal chronicles, by being six feet in his stockings, and who steadily grew,

as the scale of threats increased, till he reached the altitude of six feet

four, growing hourly in height and fierceness.


But Chugg gave no heed, and once he sang the “Ballad of the

Mule-Skinner,” with what seemed to both terrified passengers an awful

warning of their overthrow:


“As I was going down the road,

With a tired team and a heavy load,

I cracked my whip and the leaders sprung—

The fifth chain broke, and the wheelers hung,

The off-horse stepped on the wagon tongue—”


This harrowing ballad was repeated with accompanying Delsarte at intervals

during the afternoon, but as Mary and the fat lady managed to escape without

accident, they began to feel that they bore charmed lives.


At sundown they came to the road-ranch of Johnnie Dax, bearing Leander’s

compliments as a secret despatch. The outward aspect of the place was certainly

an awful warning to trustful bachelors who make acquaintances through the

columns of The Heart and Hand. The house stood solitary in that scourge of

desolation. The windows and doors gaped wide like the unclosed eyes of a dead

man on a battle-field. Chugg halloed, and an old white horse put his head out

of the door, shook it upward as if in assent, then trotted off.


“That’s Jerry, and he’s the intelligentest animal I ever

see,” remarked the stage-driver, sobering up to Jerry’s good

qualities, and presently Johnnie Dax and the white horse appeared together from

around the corner of the house.


This Mr. Dax was almost an exact replica of the other, even to the apologetic

crook in the knees and a certain furtive way of glancing over the shoulder as

if anticipating missiles.


“Pshaw now, ladies! why didn’t you let me know that you was coming?

and I’d have tidied up the place and organized a few dried-apple

pies.”


“Good house-keepers don’t wait for company to come before they get

to their work,” rebukefully commented the fat lady.


Mr. Dax, recognizing the voice of authority, seized a towel and began to beat

out flies, chickens, and dogs, who left the premises with the ill grace of old

residents. Two hogs, dormant, guarded either side of the door-step and refused

so absolutely to be disturbed by the flicking of the towel that one was tempted

to look twice to assure himself that they were not the fruits of the

sculptor’s chisel.


“Where’s your wife?” sternly demanded the fat lady.


“Oh, my Lord! I presume she’s dancin’ a whole lot over to

Ervay. She packed her ball-gown in a gripsack and lit out of here two days ago,

p’inting that way. A locomotive couldn’t stop her none if she got a

chance to go cycloning round a dance.”


In the mean time, the two hogs having failed to grasp the fact that they were

de trop, continued to doze.


“Come, girls, get up,” coaxed Johnnie, persuasively. “Maude,

I don’t know when I see you so lazy. Run on, honey—run on with

Ethel.” For Ethel, the piebald hog, finally did as she was bid.


Mary Carmichael could not resist the temptation of asking how the hogs happened

to have such unusual names.


“To tell the truth, I done it to aggravate my wife. When I finds myself a

discard in the matrimonial shuffle, I figgers on a new deal that’s going

to inclood one or two anxieties for my lady partner—to which

end—viz., namely, I calls one hawg Ethel and the other hawg Maude,

allowing to my wife that they’re named after lady friends in the East.

Them lady friends might be the daughters of Ananias and Sapphira, for all they

ever happened, but they answers the purpose of riling her same as if they were

eating their three squares daily. I have hopes, everything else failing, that

she may yet quit dancing and settle down to the sanctity of the home out of

pure jealousy of them two proxy hawgs.”


“I can just tell you this,” interrupted the fat lady: “I

don’t enjoy occupying premises after hawgs, no matter how fashionable you

name ’em. A hawg’s a hawg, with manners according, if it’s

named after the President of the United States or the King of England.”


“That’s just what I used to think, marm, of all critters before I

enjoyed that degree of friendliness that I’m now proud to own. Take Jerry

now, that old white horse—why, me and him is just like brothers. When I

have to leave the kid to his lonesome infant reflections and go off to chop

wood, I just call Jerry in, and he assoomes the responsibility of nurse like he

was going to draw wages for it.”


“I reckon there’s faults on both sides,” said the fat lady,

impartially. “No natural woman would leave her baby to a horse to mind

while she went off dancing. And no natural man would fill his house full of

critters, and them with highfalutin names. Take my advice, turn ’em

out.”


Mary did not wait to hear the continuation of the fat lady’s advice. She

went out on the desert to have one last look at the west. The sun had taken his

plunge for the night, leaving his royal raiment of crimson and gold strewn

above the mountain-tops.


Her sunset reflections were presently interrupted by the fat lady, who proposed

that they should walk till Mr. Dax had tidied up his house, observing, with

logic, that it did not devolve on them to clean the place, since they were

paying for supper and lodging. They had gone but a little way when sudden

apprehension caused the fat lady to grasp Mary’s arm. Miss Carmichael

turned, expecting mountain-lions, rattlesnakes, or stage-robbers, but none of

these casualties had come to pass.


“Land sakes! Here we be parading round the prairie, and I never found out

how that man cooked his coffee.”


“What difference does it make, if we can drink it?”


“The ways of men cooks is a sealed book to you, I reckon, or you

wouldn’t be so unconcerned—’specially in the matter of

coffee. All men has got the notion that coffee must be b’iled in a bag,

and if they ’ain’t got a regular bag real handy, they take what

they can get. Oh, I’ve caught ’em,” went on the fat lady,

darkly, “b’iling coffee in improvisations that’d turn your

stomach.”


“Yes, yes,” Mary hastily agreed, hoping against hope that she

wasn’t going to be more explicit.


“And they are so cute about it, too; it’s next to impossible to

catch ’em. You ask a man if he b’iles his coffee loose or tight,

and he’ll declare he b’iles it loose, knowing well how suspicious

and prone to investigate is the female mind. But you watch your chance and take

a look in the coffee-pot, and maybe you’ll find—”


“Yes, yes, I’ve heard—”


“I’ve seen—”


“Let’s hurry,” implored Mary.


“Have you made your coffee yet?” inquired the fat lady.


“Yes, marm,” promptly responded Johnnie.


“I hope you b’iled it in a bag—it clears it beautiful, a bag

does.”


Johnnie shifted uneasily. “No, marm, I b’iles it loose. You see,

bags ain’t always handy.”


The fat lady plied her eye as a weapon. No Dax could stand up before an

accusing feminine eye. He quailed, made a grab for the coffee-pot, and rushed

with it out into the night.


“What did I tell you?” she asked, with an air of triumph.


Johnnie returned with the empty coffee-pot. “To tell the truth, marm, I

made a mistake. I ’ain’t made the coffee. I plumb forgot it.

P’raps you could be prevailed on to assist this yere outfit to coffee

while I organizes a few sody-biscuits.”


After supper, when the fat lady was so busy talking “goo-goo”

language to the baby as to be oblivious of everything else, Mary Carmichael

took the opportunity to ask Johnnie if he knew anything about Lost Trail. The

name of her destination had come to sound unpleasantly ominous in the ears of

the tired young traveller, and she feared that her inquiry did not sound as

casual as she tried to have it. Nor was Johnnie’s candid reply

reassuring.


“It’s a pizen-mean country, from all I ever heard tell. The

citizens tharof consists mainly of coyotes and mountain-lions, with a few

rattlers thrown in just to make things neighborly. This yere

place”—waving his hand towards the arid wastes which night was

making more desolate—“is a summer resort, with modern improvements,

compared to it.”


Mary screwed her courage to a still more desperate point, and inquired if Mr.

Dax knew a family named Yellett living in Lost Trail.


“Never heard of no family living there, excepting the bluff at family

life maintained by the wild beasts before referred to. See here, miss, I

ain’t makin’ no play to inquire into your affairs, but you

ain’t thinkin’ o’ visitin’ Lost Trail, be you?”


“Perhaps,” said Mary, faintly; and then she, too, talked

“goo-goo” to the baby.


VIII.

The Rodneys At Home


All that long and never-to-be-forgotten night the stage lurched through the

darkness with Mary Carmichael the solitary passenger. The fat lady had warned

Johnnie Dax that he was on no account to replenish Chugg’s flask, if he

had the wherewithal for replenishment on the premises. Moreover, she threatened

Dax with the fury of her son should he fail in this particular; and Johnnie,

hurt to the quick by the unjust suspicion that he could fail so signally in his

duty to a lady, not only refused to replenish the flask, but threatened Chugg

with a conditional vengeance in the event of accident befalling the stage. It

was with a partially sobered and much-threatened stage-driver, therefore, that

Mary continued her journey after the supper at Johnnie Dax’s, but the

knowledge of it brought scant reassurance, and it is doubtful if the red stage

ever harbored any one more wakeful than the pale, tired girl who watched all

the changes from dark to dawn at the stage window.


Once or twice she caught a glimpse of distant camp-fires burning and knew that

some cattle outfit was camped there for the night; and once they drove so close

that she could hear the cow-boys’ voices, enriched and mellowed by

distance, borne to them on the cool, evening wind. It gave a sense of security

to know that these big-hearted, manly lads were within call, and she watched

the dwindling spark of their camp-fires and strained her ears to catch the last

note of their singing, with something of the feeling of severed comradeship.

Range cattle, startled from sleep by the stage, scrambled to their feet and

bolted headlong in the blind impulse of panic, their horns and the confused

massing of their bodies showing in sharp silhouette against the horizon for a

moment, then all would settle into quiet again. There was no moon that night,

but the stars were sown broadcast—softly yellow stars, lighting the

darkness with a shaded luster, like lamps veiled in pale-yellow gauze. The

chill electric glitter of the stars, as we know it from between the roofs of

high houses, this world of far-flung distance knows not. There the stars are

big and still, like the eyes of a contented woman.


The hoofs of the horses beat the night away as regularly as the ticking of a

clock. It grew darker as the night wore on, and sometimes a coyote would yelp

from the fringe of willows that bordered a creek in a way that made Mary recall

tales of banshees. And once, when the first pale streak of dawn trembled in the

east and the mountains looked like jagged rocks heaved against the sky and in

danger of toppling, the whole dread picture brought before her one of

Vedder’s pictures that hung in the shabby old library at home.


They breakfasted somewhere, and Chugg put fresh horses to the stage. She knew

this from their difference of color; the horses that they had left the second

Dax ranch with had been white, and these that now toiled over the sand and

desolation were apparently brown. She could not be certain that they were

brown, or that they were toiling over the sand and desolation, or that her name

was Mary Carmichael, or indeed of anything. Four days in the train, and what

seemed like four centuries in the stage, eliminated any certainty as to

anything. She could only sit huddled into a heap and wait for things to become

adjusted by time.


Chugg was behaving in a most exemplary manner. He drove rigidly as an

automaton, and apparently he looked no longer on the “lightning”

when it was bottled. Once or twice he had applied his eye to the pane that

separated him from his passenger, and asked questions relative to her comfort,

but Mary was too utterly dejected to reply in more than monosyllables. As they

crept along, the sun-dried timbers of the stage creaked and groaned in seeming

protest at wearing its life away in endless journeyings over this desert waste,

then settled down into one of those maddeningly monotonous reiterations to

which certain inanimate things are given in seasons of nervous tension. This

time it was: “All the world’s—a

stage—creak—screech—all—the world’s a

stage—creak—screech!” over and over till Mary found herself

fast succumbing to the hypnotic effect of the constant repetition, listening

for it, even, with the tyrannous eagerness of overwrought nerves, when the

stage-driver broke the spell with, “This here stage gets to naggin’

me along about here. She’s hungry for her axle-grease—that’s

what ails her.”


“I suppose,” Mary roused herself to say, “you have quite a

feeling of comradeship for the stage.”


“Me and Clara”—the stage had this name painted on the

side—“have been travelling together nigh onto four year. And while

there’s times that I would prefer a greater degree of reciprocity, these

yere silent companions has their advantages. Why, compare Clara to them female

blizzards—the two Mrs. Daxes—and you see Clara’s good

p’ints immejit. Yes, miss, the thirst-quenchers are on me if either one

of the Dax boys wouldn’t be glad to swap, but I’d have to be a heap

more locoed than I am now to consent to the transaction.”


At sunset the interminable monotony of the wilderness was broken by a house of

curious architecture, the like of which the tired young traveller had never

seen before, and whose singular candor of design made her doubt the evidence of

her own thoroughly exhausted faculties. The house seemed to consist of a series

of rooms thrown, or rather blown, together by some force of nature rather than

by formal design of builder or carpenter. The original log-cabin of this

composite dwelling looked better built, more finished, neater of aspect than

those they had previously stopped at in crossing the Desert. Springing from the

main building, like claws from a crustacean, were a series of rooms minus

either side walls or flooring. Indeed, they might easily have passed for

porches of more than usually commodious size had it not been for the beds,

bureaus, chairs, stove with attendant pots, kettles, and supper in the course

of preparation. Seen from any vantage-point in the surrounding country, the

effect was that of an interior on the stage—the background of some homely

drama where pioneer life was being realistically depicted. The dramatis persona

who occupied the centre of the stage when Mary Carmichael drove up was an

elderly woman in a rocking-chair. She was dressed in a faded pink calico gown,

limp and bedraggled, whose color brought out the parchment-like hue and texture

of her skin in merciless contrast. Perhaps because she still harbored illusions

about the perishable quality of her complexion, which gave every evidence of

having borne the brunt of merciless desert suns, snows, blizzards, and the

ubiquitous alkali dust of all seasons, she wore a pink sun-bonnet, though the

hour was one past sundown, and though she sat beneath her own roof-tree, even

if lacking the protection of four walls. From the corner of her mouth protruded

a snuff-brush, so constantly in this accustomed place that it had come to be

regarded by members of her family as part and parcel of her attire—the

first thing assumed in the morning, the last thing laid aside at night. Mary

Carmichael had little difficulty in recognizing Judith Rodney’s

step-mother, née Tumlin—she who had been the heroine of the romance

lately recorded.


Mrs. Rodney’s interest in the girl alighting from the stage was evinced

in the palsied motion of the chair as it quivered slightly back and forth in

place of the swinging seesaw with which she was wont to wear the hours away.

The snuff-brush was brought into more fiercely active commission, but she said

nothing till Mary Carmichael was within a few inches of her. Then, shifting the

snuff-brush to a position more favorable to enunciation, she said:

“Howdy? Ye be Miz Yellett’s gov’ment, ain’t ye?”

There was something threatening in her aspect, as if the office of governess to

the Yelletts carried some challenging quality.


“Government?” repeated Mary, vaguely, her head still rumbling with

the noise and motion of the stage; “I’m afraid I hardly

understand.”


“Ain’t you-uns goin’ to teach the Yellett outfit ther

spellin’, writin’, and about George Washington, an’ how the

Yankees kem along arter he was in his grave an’ fit us and broke up the

kentry so we had ter leave our home in Tennessee an’ kem to this yere

outdacious place, where nobody knows the diffunce between aig-bread an’

corn-dodger? I war a Miss Tumlin from Tennessee.”


The rocking-chair now began to recover its accustomed momentum. This

much-heralded educational expert was far from terrifying. Indeed, to Mrs.

Rodney’s hawklike gaze, that devoured every visible item of Mary’s

extremely modest travelling-dress, there was nothing so very wonderful about

“the gov’ment from the East.” With a deftness compatible only

with long practice, Mrs. Rodney now put a foot on the round of an adjoining

chair and shoved it towards Mary Carmichael in hospitable pantomime, never once

relaxing her continual rocking the meantime. Mary took the chair, and Mrs.

Rodney, after freshening up the snuff-brush from a small, tin box in her lap,

put spurs to her rocking-chair, so to speak, and started off at a brisk canter.


“I ’low it’s mighty queer you-uns don’t recognize the

job you-uns kem out yere to take, when I call it by name.” From the

sheltering flap of the pink sun-bonnet she turned a pair of black eyes full of

ill-concealed suspicion. “Miz Yellett givin’ herself as many airs

’bout hirin’ a gov’ment ’s if she wuz goin’ to

Congress. Queer you don’t know whether you be one or not!” She

withdrew into the sun-bonnet, muttering to herself. She could not be more than

fifty, Mary thought, but her habit of muttering and exhibiting her depopulated

gums while she was in the act of revivifying the snuff-brush gave her a cronish

aspect.


A babel of voices came from the open-faced room on the opposite side of the

house corresponding to the one in which Mary and Mrs. Rodney were sitting.

Apparently supper was being prepared by some half-dozen young people, each of

whom thought he or she was being imposed upon by the others. “Hand me

that knife.” “Git it yourself.” “I’ll tell maw

how you air wolfing down the potatoes as fast as I can fry ’em.”

“Go on, tattle-tale.” This was the repartee, mingled with the hiss

of frying meat, the grinding of coffee, the thumping sound made by bread being

hastily mixed in a wooden bowl standing on a wooden table. The babel grew in

volume. Dogs added to it by yelping emotionally when the smell of the newly

fried meat tempted them too near the platter and some one with a disengaged

foot at his disposal would kick them out of doors. Personalities were exchanged

more freely by members of the family, and the meat hissed harder as it was

newly turned. “Laws-a-massy!” muttered Mrs. Rodney; and then,

shoving back the sun-bonnet, she lifted her voice in a shrill, feminine shriek:


“Eudory! Eu-dory! You-do-ry!”


A Hebe-like creature, blond and pink-cheeked, in a blue-checked apron besmeared

with grease and flour, came sulkily into her mother’s presence. Seeing

Mary Carmichael, she grasped the skirt of the greasy apron with the sleight of

hand of a prestidigitateur and pleated it into a single handful. Her manner,

too, was no slower of transformation. The family sulks were instantly replaced

by a company bridle, aided and abetted by a company simper. “I

didn’t know the stage was in yet, maw. I been talking to Iry.”


“This here be Miz Yellett’s gov’ment. Maybe she’d like

to pearten up some before she eats.” She started the rocking-chair at a

gallop, to signify to her daughter that she washed her hands of further

responsibility. Being proficient in the sign language of Mrs. Rodney’s

second self, as indeed was every member of the family, Eudora led Mary to a

bench placed in one of the rooms enjoying the distinction of a side wall, and

indicated a family toilet service, which displayed every indication of having

lately seen active service. A roll-towel, more frankly significant of the

multitude of the Rodneys than had been the babel of voices, a discouraged

fragment of comb, a tin basin, a slippery atom of soap, these Eudora proffered

with an unction worthy of better things. “I declare Mist’ Chugg

have scarce left any soap, an’ I don’t believe thar’s

’nother bit in the house.” Eudora’s accent was but faintly

reminiscent of her mother’s strong Smoky Mountain dialect, as a crude

feature is sometimes softened in the second generation. It was not unpleasing

on her full, rosy mouth. The girl had the seductiveness of her half-sister,

Judith, without a hint of Judith’s spiritual quality.


Mary told her not to mind about the soap, and went to fetch her hand-bag,

which, consistent with the democratic spirit of its surroundings, was resting

against a clump of sage-brush, whither it had been lifted by Chugg. Miss

Carmichael’s individual toilet service, which was neither handsome nor

elaborate, impressed Eudora far more potently in ranking Mary as a personage

than did her dignity of office as “gov’ment.”


“I reckon you-uns must have seen Sist’ Judy up to Miz Dax’s.

I hope she war lookin’ right well.” There was in the inquiry an

unmistakable note of pride. The connection was plainly one to be flaunted.

Judith, with her gentle bearing and her simple, convent accomplishments, was

plainly the grande dame of the family. Eudora had now divested herself of the

greasy, flour-smeared apron, flinging it under the wash-bench with a single

all-sufficient movement, while Mary’s look was directed towards her

dressing-bag. In glancing up to make some remark about Judith, Mary was

confronted by a radiant apparition whose lilac calico skirts looked fresh from

the iron.


At the side of the house languished a wretched, abortive garden, running over

with weeds and sage-brush, and here a man pottered with the purposeless energy

of old age, working with an ear cocked in the direction of the house, as he

turned a spade of earth again and again in hopeless, pusillanimous industry.

But when his strained attention was presently rewarded by a shouted summons to

supper, and he stood erect but for the slouching droop of shoulders that was

more a matter of temperament than of age, one saw a tall man of massive build,

whose keen glance and slightly grizzled hair belied his groping, ineffectual

labor. The head, and face were finely modelled. Unless nature had fashioned

them in some vagrant, prankish mood, such elegance of line betokened prior

generations in which gentlemen and scholars had played some part—the

vagabond scion of a good family, perhaps. A multitude of such had grafted on

the pioneer stock of the West, under names that carried no significance in the

places whence they came.


Weakness and self-indulgence there were, and those writ large and deep, on the

face of Warren Rodney; and, in default of an expression of deeper significance,

the wavering lines of instability produced a curiously ambiguous effect of a

fine head modelled by a ’prentice hand; a lady’s copy of the

Belvidere, attempted in the ardors of the first lessons, might approximate it.


A smoking kerosene lamp revealed a supper-table of almost institutional

proportions. There were four sons and two daughters of the Tumlin union,

strapping lads and lasses all of them, with more than a common dower of lusty

health and a beauty that was something deeper than the perishable iridescence

of youth. There was Frémont, named for the explorer-soldier; there was Orlando,

named from his mother’s vague, idle musings over paper-backed literature

at certain “unchancy” seasons; there was Richards, named from pure

policy, for a local great man of whom Warren Rodney had anticipated a helping

hand at the time; there was Eudora, whose nominal origin was uncertain, unless

it bore affiliation to that of Orlando; there was Sadie, thus termed to avoid

the painful distinctions of “old Sally” and “young

Sally”; and, lastly, like a postscript, came Dan—with him, fancy,

in the matter of names, seemed to have failed. Dan was now six, a plump little

caricature of a man in blue overalls, which, as they had descended to him from

Richards in the nature of an heirloom, reached high under his armpits and

shortened the function of his suspenders to the vanishing point.


Eudora was now sixteen, and the woman-famine in all the land had gifted her

with a surprising precocity. Eudora knew her value and meant to make the most

of it. Unlike her mother in the old Black Hill days, she expected more than a

“home of her own.” To-night four suitors sat at table with Eudora,

and she might have had forty had she desired it. Any one of the four would have

cheerfully murdered the remaining three had opportunity presented itself.

Supper was a mockery to them, a Barmecide feast. Each watched his

rivals—and Eudora. This was a matter of life and death. There was no time

for food. The girl revelled in the situation to the full of her untaught,

unthinking, primitive nature. She gave the incident a tighter twist by

languishing at them in turns. She smiled, she sighed, she drove them mad by

taking crescent bites out of a slice of bread and exhibiting the havoc of her

little, white teeth with a delectably dainty gluttony.


Her mother, mumbling her supper with toothless impotency, renewed her youth

vicariously, and, while she quarrelled with her daughter from the rising of the

sun to the setting of the same, she added the last straw to the burden of the

distracted suitors by announcing what a comfort Eudora was to her and how handy

she was about the house.


Warren Rodney supported the air of an exile at his own table. Beyond a

preliminary greeting to his daughter’s guests, he said nothing. His

family, in their dealings with him, seemed to accord him the exemptions of

extreme age. He ate with the enthusiasm of a man to whom meals have become the

main business in life.


“How’s your mine up to Bad Water comin’ along, Iry?”

Orlando inquired, not from any hospitable interest in Ira’s claim, but

because he had sundry romantic interests in that neighborhood and hoped to make

use of the young prospector’s interest in his sister by securing an

invitation to return with him. Ira regarded the inquiry in the light of a

special providence. Here was his chance to impress Eudora with the splendor of

his prospects and at the same time smite the claims of his rivals, and behold!

a brother of his lady had led the way.


Ira cleared his throat. “They tell me she air like to yield a million any

day.” At this Eudora gave him the wealth of her eyes, and her mother

reached across two of the glowering suitors and dropped a hot flapjack on his

plate.


“Who sez that she air likely to yield a million any day?” inquired

Ben Swift, openly flouting such prophecy. “Yes, who sez it?”

inquired Hawks and Taylor, joining forces for the overthrow of the common

enemy.


“‘They sez’ is easy talkin’, shore ’nuff,”

mumbled Mrs. Rodney, as she helped herself to butter with her own knife.


“A sharp from the Smithsonian Institute at Washington, he said it, and he

has taken back speciments with him.”


“Ye can’t keep lackings from freightin’ round

speciments—naw, sir, ye can’t, not till the fool-killer has

finished his job.” Ben Swift charged the table with the statement as the

prosecution subtly appeals to the high grade of intelligence on the part of the

jury. The point told. Eudora, wavering in her donation of hot flapjacks, gave

them to Ben Swift.


Hawks now leaned across the table with a sinuous, beguiling motion, and,

extending his long neck towards the prospector, with the air of a

turkey-gobbler about to peck, he crooned, softly: “Ira, it’s a heap

risky puttin’ your faith in maverick sharps that trail around the

country, God-a’mightying it, renaming little, old rocks into precious

stones, seein’ gold mines in every gopher-hole they come to. They names

your backyard and the rocks appertainin’ thereunto a heap fashionable,

and like as not some sucker gives him good money to float the trash back

East.”


Mrs. Rodney, whose partisanship in any discussion was analogous to the position

of a hen perching on a fence unable to decide on which side to flutter, was

visibly impressed by Hawks’s presentation of the case. Looking towards

her daughter from under the eaves of her sun-bonnet, she “’lowed

she had hearn that Bad Water was hard on the skin, an’ that it

warn’t much of a place arter all. Folks over thar war mostly

half-livers.”


Ira, now losing all semblance of policy at being thus grievously put down by

his possible mother-in-law, “reckoned that herdin’ sheep over to

the Basin was a heap easier on the skin than livin’ in a comf’table

house over to Bad Water”—this as a fling at Hawks, who herded a

small bunch of sheep “over in the Basin.”


“Ai-yi,” openly scoffed the former Miss Tumlin; “talk’s

cheap before—” She would have considered it indelicate to supply

the word “marriage,” but by breaking off her sentence before she

came to the pith of it she continued to maintain the proprieties, and at the

same time conveyed to her audience that she was too old and experienced to

permit any fledgling from her nest to be caught, for want of a warning, by such

obvious ante-matrimonial chaff as fair promises.


“Laws a massy!” she continued, reminiscently, working her toothless

jaw to free it from an escaped splinter from the snuff-brush. “When me

an’ paw war keepin’ comp’ny, satin warn’t good enough

for me. He lowed I wuz to have half creation. Sence we wuz married he

’ain’t never found time, endurin’ all these years, to build

me a bird-house.”


The unbuilt bird-house was the Banquo’s ghost at the Rodney board, Mrs.

Rodney hearkening back to it in and out of season. If the family made merry

over a chance windfall of game or fresh vegetables, a prospect of possible

employment for one of the boys, a donation of money from Judith, Mrs. Rodney

remembered the unbuilt bird-house and indulged herself to the full of

melancholy. It is not improbable that, if she had been asked to name the

chiefest disappointment of her wretched married life, she would have mentioned

the bird-house that was never built.


At mention of it Warren Rodney murmured broken, deprecatory excuses. His dull

eyes nervously travelled about the table for some one to make excuses for him.

The family broke into hearty peals of laughter; the tragedy of the first

generation had grown to be the unfailing source of merriment for the second.


“Maw,” began Orlando, “the reason you don’t get no

bird-house built out hyear is that they ain’t no birds. We have offered

time and time again to build you a house fo’ buzzuds, they bein’

the only birds hyearabouts, but you ’low that you ain’t

fav’ble to tamin’ ’em.”


“I wuz raised in Tennessee, an’ we-uns had a house for martins made

out’n gourds, an’ it was pearty.” The pride with which she

repeated this particular claim to honor in an alien land never diminished with

repetition. As she advanced further through the dim perspective of years, the

little mountain town in Tennessee became more and more the centre of

cultivation and civic importance. The desolate cabin that she had left for the

interminable journey westward was recalled flatteringly through the hallowing

mists of time. The children, by reason of these chronicles, had grown to regard

their mother as a sort of princess in exile.


“Mrs. Rodney”—Swift leaned towards her and whispered

something in her ear. She regarded him tentatively, then grinned. At her time

of life, why should she put faith in the promises of men? “You fix it up,

an’ you get your bird-house,” was the conclusion of his sentence.


While this discussion had been in progress the viands had not been neglected

except by such members of the company as had been bereft of appetite by loftier

emotions—in consequence of which the table appeared to have sustained a

visitation of seventeen-year locusts. Eudora, ever economic in the value she

placed not only upon herself but her environment, proposed to her guests that

they should wash the dishes, an art in which they were by no means deficient,

being no exception to the majority of range bachelors in their skill in homely

pursuits. And thus it came to pass that Eudora’s suitors, swathed in

aprons, meekly washed dishes shoulder to shoulder, while their souls craved the

performance of valorous deeds.


As this was the last stage station on the way to Lost Trail, Mary Carmichael

was perforce obliged to content herself till Mrs. Yellett should call or send

for her. After supper, Chugg, with fresh horses to the stage, left

Rodney’s, apparently for some port in that seemingly pathless sea of

foot-hills. That there should be trails and defined routes over this vast,

unvaried stretch of space seemed more wonderful to Mary than the charted

high-roads of the Atlantic. The foot-hills seemed to have grown during the long

journey till they were foot-hills no longer; they had come to be the smaller

peaks of the towering range that had formed the spine of the desert. The air,

that seemed to have lost some of its crystalline quality on the flat stretches

of the plains, was again sparkling and heady in the clean hill country. It

stirred the pulses like some rare vintage, some subtle distillation of

sun-warmed fruit that had been mellowing for centuries.


Very lonely seemed the Rodney home among the great company of mountains. A

brooding desolation had settled on it at close of day, and all the laughter and

light footsteps and gayly ringing voices of the young folk could not dispel the

feeling of being adrift in a tiny shell on the black waters of some unknown

sea; or thus it seemed to the stranger within their gate.


Mrs. Rodney retired within the flap of her sun-bonnet after the evening meal,

settling herself in the rocking-chair as if it were some sort of conveyance.

Her family, who might have told the hour of day or her passing mood by the

action of the chair, knew by her pacific gait that she would lament the unbuilt

bird-house no more that night. The snuff-brush, newly replenished from the tin

box, kept perfect time to the motion of the chair. With the lady of the house

it was one of the brief seasons of passing content vouchsafed by an ample meal

and a good digestion.


Warren Rodney took down a gun from the wall and began to clean it. His hands

had the fumbling, indefinite movements, the obscure action, directed by a brain

already begun to crumble. His industry with the gun was of a part with the

impotent dawdling in the garden. His eyes would seek for the rag or the bottle

of oil in a dull, glazed way, and, having found them, he would forget the

reason of his quest. Not once that evening had they rested on his wife or any

member of his family. He had shown no interest in any of the small happenings

of home, the frank rivalry of Eudora’s suitors, the bickerings of the

girls and boys over the division of household labor. The one thing that had

momentarily aroused his somnolent intelligence was a revival of his

wife’s plaint anent the unbuilt bird-house. That, and a certain furtive

anxiety during supper lest his daughter Eudora should forget to keep his plate

piled high, were the only signs of a participation in the life about him.


From one of the rooms that opened to the world like a stage to the audience,

Mrs. Rodney kept her evening vigil. The last faint amethystine haze on the

mountains was deepening. They towered about the valley where the house lay,

with a challenging immensity, mocking the pitiful grasp of these pygmies on the

thousand hills. The snow on the taller of the peaks still held the high lights.

But all the valleys and the spaces between the mountains were wrapped in sombre

shadows; the crazy house invading the great company of mountains, penetrating

brazenly to the very threshold of their silent councils, seemed but a pitiful

ant-hill at the mercy of some possible giant tread. The ill-adjusted family,

disputing every inch of ground with the wilderness, became invested with a

dignity quite out of keeping with its achievements. Their very weaknesses and

vanities, old Sally still clinging to her sun-bonnet and her limp rose-colored

skirts, an eternal requiem for the dead and gone complexion, lost the

picturesqueness of the pioneer and ranked as universal qualities, admissible in

the austerest setting. Perhaps in some far distant council of the Daughters of

the Pioneers a prospective member of the house of Rodney would unctuously

announce: “My great-great-grandmother was a Miss Tumlin of Tennessee;

great-great-grandfather’s first wife had been a Sioux squaw. Isn’t

it interesting and romantic?”


Eudora now came to her mother with great news. Hawks had taken the first

opportunity of being alone with her to tell her of Jim’s release from

jail and of his abortive encounter with Simpson in the eating-house. He had not

deferred the telling from any feeling of reticence regarding the disclosure of

family affairs before strangers. News travels in the desert by some unknown

agency. Twenty-four hours after a thing happened it would be safe to assume

that every cow and sheep outfit in a radius of three hundred miles would be

discussing it over their camp-fires; and this long before there was an inch of

telegraph wire or a railroad tire in the country. Hawks had merely reserved the

news for Eudora’s private ear because he hoped thus to gain an advantage

over his three rivals.


“Ai-yi!” said old Sally, sharply, and the chair came to an abrupt

stand-still. “In the name o’ Heaven, how kem they to let him

out?” Mrs. Rodney’s knowledge of the law was of the vaguest; and if

incarceration would keep a prisoner out of more grievous trouble, she could not

understand giving him his freedom. To her the case was analogous to releasing a

child from the duress of a corner and turning him loose to play with matches.

“How kem they to let him out?” she repeated, the still

rocking-chair conveying the impersonal dignity of the pulpit or the

justice-seat. “I ’ain’t hearn tell of so pearty a couple as

the jail an’ Jim in years.”


The meaning that she put into her words belied their harsh face-value. With Jim

in jail, her mind was comparatively at rest about him. She knew he had been

branding other men’s cattle since the destruction of his sheep, and she

knew the fate of cattle-thieves, and that Jim would be no exception to the

rule. With her purely instinctive maternity, she had been fond of Jim. He had

been one more boy to mother. She harbored no ill-feeling towards him that he

was not her own. Moreover, she wanted no gallows-tree intermingled with the

annals of her family. It suited her convenience at this particular time that

Jim should stay in jail. That he had been given his freedom loosed the phials

of her condemnation on the incompetents that released him.


“I ’low they wuz grudgin’ him the mouthful they fed to him,

that they ack so outdaciously plumb locoed as to tu’n a man out to get

hisself hanged. An’ Jim never wuz a hearty eater. He never seemed to

relish his food, even when he wuz a growin’ kid.”


A pale, twinkling point of light, faintly glimmering in the vast solitudes

above the billowing peaks, suddenly burst into a dazzling constellation before

the girl and her mother. “It’s a warning!” shivered the old

woman. “Some’um’s bound to happen.” She began to rock

herself slowly. The thing she dreaded had already come to pass in her

imagination. Jim a free man was Jim a dead man. He was so dead that already his

step-mother was going on with a full acceptance of the idea. She reviewed her

relationship to him. No, she had nothing to blame herself for. He had been more

troublesome than any of her own children and for that reason she had been more

liberal with the rod. And yet—the face of the squaw rose before her,

wraithlike, accusing! “Ai-yi!” she said; but this time her favorite

expletive was hardly more than a sigh.


“I mind Jim when he first kem to us,” she said, more to herself

than to Eudora, who sat at her feet. The impending tragedy in the family had

robbed her of all the joy in her suitors. They sat on a bench on the opposite

side of the house, divided by the very nature of their interests yet companions

in misery.


“He wuz scarce four, an’ yet he had never been broke of the habit

of sucking his thumb. Ef he’d ben my child, I’d a lammed it

out’n him before he’d a seen two, but seem’ he was aged for

an infant havin’ such practices, I tried to shame him out’n it.

But, Lord a massy, men folks is hard to shame even at four. I hissed at him

like a gyander every time I seen him do it. Now I’d a knowed

better—I’d a sewed it up in a pepper rag.”


“What’s suckin’ his thumb as an infant got to do with his

gettin’ lynched now?” demanded Eudora, with the scepticism of the

second generation.


“Wait till you-uns has children of your own,” sniffed her mother,

from the assured position of maternal experience, “an’ see the

infant that’s allowed to suck its thumb has the makin’s in him of a

felon or a unfortunit.” She rocked a slow accompaniment to her dismal,

prophecy.


Eudora’s eyes, big with wonder, were fixed on the crouching flank of a

distant mountain. Her mother broke the silence. Not often did they speak thus

intimately. Old Sally belonged to that class of mothers who feel a pride in

their reticent dealings with their daughters, and who consider the management

of all affairs of the heart peculiarly the province of youth and inexperience.


But to-night she was prompted by a force beyond her ken to speak to the girl.

“Eudory, in pickin’ out one of them men,” she jerked her

thumb towards the opposite side of the house, “git one tha’s clar

o’ the trick o’ stampedin’ round other wimming. It’s

bound to kem back to ye, same as counterfeit money.”


Eudora giggled. She was of an age when the fascinations of curiosity as to the

unknown male animal prompt lavish conjecture. “I ’lowed they all

stampeded.”


“Yes,” leered the old woman—and she grinned the whole horrid

length of her empty gums—“the most of ’em does. But you must

shet your eyes to it. The moment they know you swallow it, they’s

wuthless, like horses that has run away once.”


“Hark!” said Eudora. “Ain’t that wheels?”


“It be,” answered her mother. “It be that old Ma’am

Yellett after her gov’ment.”


IX.

Mrs. Yellett And Her “Gov’ment”


The buckboard drew up to the back or open-faced entrance of the Rodney house

with a splendid sweep, terminating in a brilliantly staccato halt, as if to

convey to the residents the flattering implication that their house was reached

via a gravelled driveway, rather than across lumpish inequalities of prairie

overgrown with cactus stumps and clumps of sage-brush. From the buckboard

stepped a figure whose agility was compatible with her driving.


No sketchy outline can do justice to Mrs. Yellett or her costume. Like the bee,

the ant, and other wonders of the economy of nature, she was not to be disposed

of with a glance. And yet there was no attempt at subtlety on her part; on the

contrary, no one could have an appearance of greater candor than the lady whose

children Mary Carmichael had come West to teach. Her costume was a thing apart,

suggesting neither sex, epoch, nor personal vanity, but what it lacked of these

more usual sartorial characteristics, it more than made up in a passionate

individualism; an excessively short skirt, so innocent of “fit” or

“hang” in its wavering, indeterminate outline as to suggest the

possible workmanship of teeth rather than of scissors; and riding-boots coming

well to the knee, displaying a well-shaped, ample foot, perched aloft on the

usual high heel that cow-punchers affect as the expression of their chiefest

vanity. But Mrs. Yellett was not wholly mannish in her tastes, and to offset

the boots she wore a bodice of the type that a generation ago used to be known

as a “basque.” It fitted her ample form as a cover fits a

pin-cushion, the row of jet buttons down the front looking as if a deep breath

might cause them to shoot into space at any moment with the force of Mauser

bullets.


Such a garb was not, after all, incongruous with this original lady’s

weather-beaten face. Her skin was tanned to a fine russet, showing tiny,

radiating lines about the eyes when they twinkled with laughter, which was

often. No individual feature was especially striking, but the general

impression of her countenance was of animation and activity, mingled with

geniality and with native shrewdness.


“Howdy, Miz Yellett,” called out old Sally, hitching her rocker

forward, in an excitement she could ill conceal. “You-uns’

gov’ment come, an’ she ain’t much bigger’n a lettle

green gourd. Don’t seem to have drawed all the growth comin’ to her

yit.”


“In roundin’ up the p’ints of my gov’ment, Mis’

Rodney, you don’t want to forget that green gourds and green grapes is

mighty apt to belong to the sour fambly, when they hangs beyant your

reach.”


“Ai-yi!” grimaced old Sally. “It’s tol’able far

to send East for green fruit. We can take our own pep’mint.”


The prospective advent of a governess in the Yellett family, moreover, one from

that mysterious centre of culture, the East, had not only rent the neighborhood

with bitter factions, but had submitted the Yelletts to the reproach of

ostentation. In those days there were no schools in that portion of the Wind

River country where the Yelletts grazed their flocks and herds. Parents anxious

to obtain “educational advantages”—that was the term,

irrespective of the age of the student or the school he attended—sent

them, often, with parental blindness as to the equivocal nature of the blessing

thus conferred, to visit friends in the neighboring towns while they “got

their education.” Or they went uneducated, or they picked up such crumbs

of knowledge as fell from the scant parental board. But never, up to the

present moment, had any one flown into the face of neighborly precedent except

sturdy Sarah Yellett.


Old Sally, in her eagerness to convey that she was in no degree impressed with

the pedagogical importation, like many another belligerent lost the first round

of the battle through an excess of personal feeling. But though down, Sally was

by no means out, and after a brief session with the snuff-brush she returned to

the field prepared to maintain that the Yellett children, for all their

pampering in the matter of having a governess imported for their benefit, were

no better off than her own brood, who had taken the learning the gods provided.


“Too bad, Miz Yellett, that you-uns had to hire that gov’ment

without lookin’ over her p’ints. I’ve ben takin’ her in

durin’ supper, and she’ll never be able to thrash ’em past

Clem. She mought be able to thrash Clem if she got plumb mad, these yere slim

wimmin is tarrible wiry ’n’ active at such times, but she’ll

never be able to thrash beyant her.” And having injected the vitriolic

drop in her neighbor’s cup of happiness, Old Sally struck a gait on her

chair which was the equivalent of a gallop.


But Mrs. Yellett was not the sort of antagonist to be left gaping on the road,

awed to silence by the action of a rocking-chair, no matter how brilliant.


“I reckon I can thrash my own children when it’s needed, without

gettin’ in help from the East, or hereabouts either, for that matter. If

other folks would only take out their public-spirited reformin’

tendencies on their own famblies, there’d be a heap less lynchin’

likely to happen round the country in the course of the next ten years.”


Old Sally let the home-thrust pass. “Who ever hearn tell of a good

teacher that wasn’t a fine thrasher in the bargain?” She swung the

chair about with a pivotal motion, as if she were addressing an assemblage

instead of a single listener, and then, bethinking herself of a clinching

illustration, she called aloud to her daughter to bear witness. “Eudory!

Eu-do-ry! You-do-ry!”


“Ye-’s ma’am,” drawled the daughter, coming most

unwillingly from the open-faced room opposite, where she had been inciting all

four of the suitors to battle.


“What was it they called that teacher down to Caspar that larruped the

hide off’n the boys?”


“A fine dis-a-ply-narian, maw.”


“Yes, that’s it—a dis-a-ply-narian. What kin a lettle green

gourd like her know ’bout dis-apply-in?”


“Your remarks shore remind me of a sayin’ that ‘the

discomfort of havin’ to swallow other folks’ dust causes a heap of

anxiety over their reckless driving.’”


Mrs. Yellett flicked her riding-boot with her whip. Her voice dropped a couple

of tones, her accent became one of honeyed sweetness.


“Your consumin’ anxiety regardin’ my gov’ment and my

children shore reminds me of a narrative appertainin’ to two dawgs. Them

dawgs was neighbors, livin’ in adj’inin’ yards separated by a

fence, and one day one of them got a good meaty bone and settled hisself down

to the enj’yment thereof. And his intimate friend and neighbor on the

other side of the fence, who had no bone to engage his faculties, he began to

fret hisself ’bout the business of his friend. S’pose he was to

choke hisself over that bone. S’pose the meat disagreed with him. And he

begins to bark warnin’s, but the dawg with the bone he keeps right on.

But the other dawg he dashes hisself again the fence and he scratches with his

claws. He whines pitiful, he’s that anxious about his friend. But the

dawg with the bone he went right on till he gnawed it down to the last morsel,

and, goin’ to the hole in the fence whar his friend had kep’ that

anxious vigil, he says: ‘Friend, the only thing that consoled me while

having to endure the anguish of eatin’ that bone was the thought of your

watchful sympathy!’ Which bein’ the case, I’d thank you to

tell me whar I can find my gov’ment.”


“Ai-yi!” said old Sally. “I ain’t seein’ no bone

this deal. Just a lettle green gourd ’s all I see with my strongest

specs.”


Mary Carmichael, in one of the inner rooms, was writing a home letter, which

was chiefly remarkable for what it failed to relate. It gave long accounts of

the scenery, it waxed didactic over the future of the country; but the

adventures of the trip, with her incidental acquaintance with the Daxes and

Chugg, were not recorded. Eudora announced the arrival of Mrs. Yellett, and

Mary, at the news, dropped the contents of her portfolio and started up with

much the feeling a marooned sailor might have on hearing a sail has been

sighted. At this particular stage of her career Miss Carmichael had not

developed the philosophy that later in life was destined to become her most

valuable asset. Her sense of humor no longer responded to the vagaries of

pioneer life. The comedy element was coming a little too thick and fast. She

was getting a bit heart-sick for a glimpse of her own kind, a word with some

one who spoke her language. And here, at last, was the woman who had written

such a charming letter, who had so graciously intimated that there was room for

her at the hearth-stone. Mary was, indeed, eager to make the acquaintance of

Mrs. Yellett.


To the end of her life she never forgot that first meeting—the perfect

confidence with which she followed Eudora to the open room, the ensuing blank

amazement, the utter inability to reconcile the Mrs. Yellett of the letter with

the Mrs. Yellett of fact. The lamp on the table, burning feebly, seemed to

burst into a thousand shooting-stars as the girl struggled with her tears. Home

was so far, and Mrs. Yellett was so different from what she had expected! And

yet, as she felt her fingers crush in the grip of that hard but not unkindly

hand, there was in the woman’s rugged personality a sustaining quality;

and, thinking again of Archie’s prospects, Mary was not altogether sorry

that she had come.


“You be a right smart young maverick not to get lost none on this long

trail, and no one to p’int you right if you strayed,” commented

Mary’s patroness, affably. “But we won’t roominate here no

longer than we can help. It’s too hard on old Ma’am Rodney.

She’s just ’bout the color of withered cabbage now, ’long of

me havin’ you.”


While she talked, Mrs. Yellett picked up Mary’s trunk and bags and stowed

them in the back of the buckboard with the ease with which another woman might

handle pasteboard boxes. One or two of the male Rodneys offered to help, but

she waved them aside and lashed the luggage to the buckboard, handling the

ropes with the skill of an old sailor. The entire Rodney family and the suitors

of Eudora assembled to witness the departure. “It’s a heap friendly

of you to fret so,” was the parting stab of Sarah Yellett to Sally

Rodney; and she swung the backboard about, cleared the cactus stumps in the

Rodney door-yard, and gained the mountain-road.


“Ai-yi!” said old Sally. “What’s this country

comin’ to?”


“A few more women, thank God!” remarked Ira. Eudora had just

snubbed him, and he put a wealth of meaning into his look after the vanishing

buckboard.


The night was magnificent. From horizon to horizon the sky was sown with

quivering points of light. Each straggling clump of sage-brush, rocky ledge,

and bowlder borrowed a beauty not its own from the yellow radiance of the

stars.


They had gone a good two miles before Mary’s patroness broke the silence

with, “Nothing plumb stampedes my temper like that Rodney

outfit—old Sally buckin’ an’ pitchin’ in her

rockin’-chair same as if she was breakin’ a bronco, an’ that

Eudory always corallin’, deceivin’, and jiltin’ one outfit of

men after another. If she was a daughter of mine, I’d medjure her length

across my knee, full growed and courted though she is. The only one of the

outfit that’s wuth while is Judith, an’ she ain’t old woman

Rodney’s girl, neither. You hyeard that already, did you? Well, this yere

country may be lackin’ in population, but it’s handy as a

sewin’-circle in distributin’ news.”


Mary mentioned Leander. “Yes,” answered Mrs. Yellett, reflectively,

“Leander’s mouth do run about eight and a half octaves. Sometimes I

don’t blame his wife for bangin’ down the lid.”


They talked of Jim Rodney’s troubles, and the growing hatred between

sheep and cattle men, because of range rights.


“Now that pore Jim had a heap of good citizen in him, before that

pestiferous cattle outfit druv’ his sheep over the cliff. Relations

’twixt sheep and cattle men in this yere country is strained beyant the

goin’-back place, I can tell you. My pistol-eye ’ain’t had a

wink of sleep for nigh on eighteen months, an’ is broke to wakefulness

same as a teethin’ babe.


“Jim was wild as a coyote ’fore he marries that girl. She come all

the way from Topeka, Kansas, thinking she was goin’ to find a respectable

home, and when she come out hyear and found the place was a dance-hall, she

cried all the time. She didn’t add none to the hilarity of the place.

An’ one day Jim he strolled in, an’ seem’ the girl

a-cryin’ like a freshet and wishin’ she was dead, he inquired the

cause. She told him how that old harpy wrote her, an’, bein’ an

orphant, she come out thinkin’ she was goin’ to a respectable place

as waitress, an’ Jim he ’lowed it was a case for the law. He was a

little shy of twenty at the time, just a young cockerel ’bout

br’ilin’ size. Some of the old hangers-on ’bout the place

they see a heap of fun in Jim’s takin’ on ’bout the girl, he

bein’ that young that he had scarce growed a pair of spurs yet. An’

one of ’em says to him,’ Sonny, if you’re afeerd that this

yere corral is onjurious to the young lady’s morals, we’ll call in

the gospel sharp, if you’ll stand for the brand.’ Now Jim

hadn’t a cent, nor no callin’, nor a prospect to his back, but he

struts up to the man that was doin’ the talkin’, game as a bantam,

an’ he says, ‘The lady ain’t rakin’ in anythin’

but a lettle white chip, in takin’ me, but if she’s willin’,

here’s my hand.’


“At which that pore young thing cried harder than ever. Well, Jim he up

an’ marries the girl an’ it turns out fine. He gets a job

herdin’ sheep on shares, an’ she stays with the Rodney outfit till

he saves enough to build a cabin. Things is goin’ with Jim like a prairie

afire. In a few years he acquires a herd of his own, a fine herd, not a scabby

sheep in the bunch. Alida she makes him the best kind of a wife, them kids is

the pride of his life, and then, them cursed cattle-men do for him. Of course,

he takes to rustlin’; I’d do more’n rustle if they’d

touch mine.”


The pair of broncos that Mrs. Yellett was driving humped their backs like cats

as they climbed the steep mountain-road. With her, driving was an exact

science. It was a treat to see her handle the ribbons. Mary asked some trifling

question about the children and it elicited the information that one of the

girls was named Cacta. “Yes,” she said, “I like new names for

children, not old ones that is all frazzled out and folks has suffered

an’ died to. It seems to start ’em fair, like playin’ cards

with a new deck. Cacta’s my oldest daughter, and I named her after the

flowers that blooms all over the desert spite of everything, heat, cold,

an’ rain an’ alkali dust—the cactus blooms right through it

all. Even its own thorns don’t seem to fret it none. I called her plain

Cactus till she was three, and along came a sharp studyin’ the flowers

an’ weeds out here, and he ’lowed that Cactus was a boy’s

name an’ Cacta was for girls—called it a feeminin tarnation, or

somethin’ like that, so we changed it. My second daughter

’ain’t got quite so much of a name. She’s called Clematis.

That holds its own out here pretty well, ’long by the willows on the

creek. Paw ’lowed he was terrible afraid that I’d name the youngest

girl Sage-brush, so he spoke to call her Lessie Viola, an’ I giv’

in. The boys is all plain named, Ben, Jack, and Ned. Paw wouldn’t hear of

a fancy brand bein’ run onto ’em.”


The temperature fell perceptibly as they climbed the heights, and the air had

the heady quality of wine. It was awesome, this entering into the great company

of the mountains. Presently Mary caught the glimmer of something white against

the dark background of the hills. It gleamed like a snow-bank, though they were

far below the snow-line on the mountain-side they were climbing.


“Well, here be camp,” announced Mrs. Yellett. What Mary had taken

for a bank of snow was a huge, canvas-covered wagon. Several dogs ran down to

greet the buckboard, barking a welcome. In the background was a shadowy group,

huge of stature, making its way down the mountain-path. “And here’s

all the children come to meet teacher.” Mrs. Yellett’s tone was

tenderly maternal, as if it was something of a feat for the children to walk

down the mountain-path to meet their teacher. But Mary, straining her eyes to

catch a glimpse of her little pupils, could discover nothing but a group of

persons that seemed to be the sole survivors of some titanic race. Not one

among them but seemed to have reached the high-water mark of six feet. Was it

an optical illusion, a hallucination born of the wonderful starlight? Or were

they as huge as they seemed? The young men looked giants, the girls as if they

had wandered out of the first chapters of Genesis. Their mother introduced

them. They all had huge, warm, perspiring hands, with grips like bears. Mary

looked about for a house into which she could escape to gather her scattered

faculties, but the starlight, yellow and luminous, revealed none. There was the

huge covered wagon that she had taken for a snow-bank, there was a small tent,

there were two light wagons, there were dogs innumerable, but there was no sign

of a house.


“What do you think of it?” inquired Mrs. Yellett, smilingly,

anticipating a favorable answer.


“It’s almost too beautiful to leave.” Mary innocently

supposed that Mrs. Yellett referred to the starlit landscape. “But

I’m so tired, Mrs. Yellett, and so glad to get to a real home at last,

that I’m going to ask if you will not show me the way to the house so

that I may go to bed right away.”


This apparently reasonable request was greeted by a fine chorus of titanic

laughter from Mary’s pupils. Mrs. Yellett waved her hand over the

surrounding landscape in comprehensive gesture.


“Ain’t all this large enough for you?” she asked, gayly.


“You mean the mountains? They’re wonderful. But—I really

think I’d like to go in the house.”


“I shore hope you ain’t figgerin’ on goin’ into no

house, ’cause there ain’t no house to go into.” She laughed

merrily, as if the idea of such an effete luxury as a house were amusing.

“This yere family ’ain’t ever had a house—it

camps.”


Mary gasped. The real meaning of words no longer had the power of making an

impression on her. If Mrs. Yellett had announced that they were in the habit of

sleeping in the moon, it would not have surprised her.


“If you are tired, an’ want to go to bed, you can shuck off and lie

down any time. Ben, Jack, Ned, go an’ set with paw in the tent while the

gov’ment gets ready for bed. Cacta and Clem, you help me with them

quilts.”


Mary stood helpless in the wilderness while quilts and pillows were fetched

somewhere from the adjacent scenery, and Mrs. Yellett asked her, with the

gravity of a Pullman porter interrogating a passenger as to the location of

head and foot, if she liked to sleep “light or dark.” She chose

“dark” at random, hating to display her ignorance of the

alternatives, with the happy result that her bed was made up to leeward of the

great sheep-wagon, in a nice little corner of the State of Wyoming. Mary was

grateful that she had chosen dark.


As she dozed off, she was reminded of a certain magazine illustration that

Archie had pinned over his bed after the aunts had given a grudging consent to

this westward journey. There was a line beneath the pictorial decoy which read:

“Ranch Life in the New West.” And there were piazzas with fringed

Mexican hammocks, wild-grass cushions, a tea-table with a samovar, and, last, a

lady in white muslin pouring tea. The stern reality apparently consisted in

scorching alkali plains, with houses of the packing-box school of architecture

at a distance of seventy or eighty miles apart. No ladies in white muslin

poured tea; they garbed themselves in simple gunny-sacking, and their repartee

had an acrid, personal note. But Mary was glad to know that Archie had that

picture, and that he thought of her in such ideal surroundings.


X.

On Horse-thief Trail


Judith, on her black mare, Dolly, left the Dax ranch after the mid-day meal to

go in quest of her brother. He had left his comfortable cabin on the Bear

Creek, when he had turned rustler, and moved into the “bad man’s

country,” one of those remote mountain fastnesses that abound in Wyoming

and furnish a natural protection to the fugitive from justice. Judith took the

left fork of the road even as Peter Hamilton had chosen the right, the day she

had watched him gallop towards Kitty Colebrooke with never a glance backward.

Judith strove now to put him and the memory of that day from her mind by

turning towards the open country without a glance in the direction he had

taken. But her thoughts were weary of journeying over that trail that she would

not look towards; in imagination she had travelled it with Peter a hundred

times, saw each dip and turn of the yellow road, each feature of the landscape

as he rode exultant to Kitty, to be turned, tried, taken or left as her mood

should prompt. But Judith was more woman than saint, and in her heart there was

a blending of joy and pain. For she knew—such skill has love in inference

from detail—that the mysterious far-away girl, who was so powerful that

she could have whatever she wanted, even to Peter, loved her own ambitions

better than she did Peter or Peter’s happiness, and that she would not

marry him except as a makeshift. For Miss Colebrooke wrote verses; Peter had a

white-and-gold volume of them that Judith fancied he said his prayers to.


As for Peter himself, he had never been able to explain the magic Kitty had

brewed for him. There was a heady quality in the very ring of her name. His

first glimpse of her, on Class Day, in a white gown and a hat that to his manly

indiscrimination looked as guileless as a sheaf of poppies nodding above the

pale-yellow hair that had the sheen of corn-silk, had been a vision that

stirred in him heroic promptings. He had no difficulty in securing an

introduction. She was a connection of the Wetmores, as was he, though through

opposite sides of the house. In the few minutes’ talk that followed, he

had the disconcerting sensation of being “talked down to.” There

was the indulgent tolerance of the woman of the world to the “nice

boy” about this amazing young woman, who might have been eighteen.

Hamilton had repudiated the very suggestion of being a “nice boy.”

But he felt himself blushing, groping for words, saying stupid things,

supplying every requisite of the “nice boy” as if he were acting

the part. Her chaperon bore her away presently, and he was left with a radiant

impression of corn-silk hair and a complexion that justified Bouguereau’s

mother-of-pearl flesh tints. And when she had tilted the ruffled lace parasol

over her shoulder, so that it framed her head like a fleecy halo, he had seen

that her eyes were green as jade. Withal he had a sense of having acquitted

himself stupidly.


Later, when he ran the gamut of some friends, they had chaffed him on his

hardihood. By Jove! He had nerve to look at her! Didn’t he know she was

“the” Miss Colebrooke? Now Hamilton was absolutely ignorant of Miss

Colebrooke’s right of way to the definite article, but it was

characteristic of him to make no inquiries. On the whole, he found the

situation meeting with a greater number of the artistic requirements than such

situations usually presented. He was still dallying with this pleasant

vagueness of sensation when he picked up a copy of a magazine, and the name

Katherine Colebrooke caught his eye and held it like the flight of a comet. Her

contribution was a sonnet entitled “The Miracle.” As a naïve

emotional confession, “The Miracle” interested him; as a sonnet, he

rent it unmercifully.


Peter was to learn, however, that this sonnet was but a solitary flake in a

poetic fall of more or less magnitude. He rather conspicuously avoided a

reference to her poetry when they met again. To him it was the very least of

her gifts. Her hair, that had the tender yellow of ripening corn, was worthy a

cycle of sonnets, but pray leave the making of them to some one else! By

daylight the jade-colored eyes seemed to shut out the world. The pupils shrank

to pin-points. The green looked deep—as many fathoms as the sea. She was

all Diana by daylight, a huntress, if you will, of the elusive epithet, but

essentially a maiden goddess, who would add no sprightly romance to the

chronicles of Olympus. By lamp-light she suggested quite another divinity. The

pin-points expanded; they burned black, like coals newly breaking into flame.


When Hamilton knew her better, he did not like to think that he had thought her

eighteen at their first meeting. It impugned his judgment as a man of the

world. Young ladies of eighteen could not possibly be contributors of several

years’ standing to the various magazines. Disconcerting scraps of gossip

floated to him. He heard of her as bridesmaid at a famous wedding of six years

back, when she had deflected the admiration from the bride and remained the

central figure of the picture. Her portrait by Sargent had been the sensation

of the Salon when he had been a grubby-faced boy with his nose in a Latin

grammar. An unusual situation was abhorrent to him. That he should marry an

older woman, one, moreover, who had gained her public in a field to which he

had not gained admission, was doubly distasteful by reason of his deference to

the conventional. If she had flirted with him, his midsummer madness would have

evaporated into thin air; but she kept him at arm’s-length, ostensibly

took him seriously, and the boy proposed.


Her rejection of him was a matter of such consummate skill that Hamilton did

not realize the keenness of his disappointment till he was swinging westward

over the prairies. She had confided to him that her work claimed her and that

she must renounce those sweet responsibilities that made the happiness of other

women. It was with the protective mien of one who sought to shield him from an

adverse destiny that she declined his suit.


This had all happened seven years ago. In the mean time he had adjusted his

disappointment to the new life of the West. To say that he had fallen in love

with the situation would be to misrepresent him. But the rôle of lonely

cow-puncher loyally wedded to the thought of his first love was not without

charm to Peter. How long his constancy would have survived the test of

propinquity to a woman of Judith Rodney’s compelling personality, other

things being equal, it would be difficult to hazard a guess. The coming of

Judith from the convent increased the perspective into which Kitty was

retreating. With the vivid plainswoman in the foreground, the pale-haired

writer of verse dwindled almost to reminiscence. But the reverence for the

usual, that made up the underlying motive for so much of Hamilton’s

conduct, presented barriers alongside of which his previous quandary regarding

Miss Colebrooke’s seniority shrank to insignificance. He might marry a

woman older than himself and swallow the grimace of it, but by no conceivable

system of argument could he persuade himself to marry into a family like that

of the Rodneys—the girl herself, for all her beauty and rare womanliness,

a quarter Indian, her father the synonyme for obloquy, her brother a cattle

thief. Hamilton preferred that other men should make the heroic marriages of a

new country. He was prepared to applaud their hardihood of temperament, but in

his own case such a thing was inconceivable. Similar arguments have ensnared

multitudes in the web of caution and provided a rich feast for the arch-spider,

convention, the shrivelled flies dangling in the web conveying no significance,

apparently, beyond that of advertising the system.


When Peter went East, he had expected to find Kitty worn by the pursuit of

epithets, haunted by the phantom of a career, resigned to the slings and arrows

of remorseful spinsterhood. An obvious regret, or, at least, resignation

tempered with remembrance, was the unguent he anticipated at the hands of

Kitty. But alas for sanctuaries built to refuge wounded pride! He found Kitty

the pivot of an adoring coterie, the magazines flowing with the milk and honey

of her verse and she looking younger, if possible, than when he had first known

her. Time, experience, even the pangs of literary parturition had not writ a

single character on that alabaster brow. The very atrophy of the forces of time

which she had accomplished by unknown necromancy seemed to endow her with an

elfin youth, making her seem smaller, more childlike, more radiantly elusive

than when she had worn the poppy hat at Cambridge.


The tan and hardship of the prairie had adjusted the blunder of their ages.

Stark conditions had overdrawn his account perhaps a decade; she retained a

surplus it would be rude to estimate. Her greeting of him was radiant, her

welcome panoplied in words that verged close to inspiration. A woman would have

scented warning instantly, deep feeling and the curled and perfumed phrase

being suspicious cronies and sure to rouse those lightly slumbering watch-dogs,

the feminine wits. But Peter only turned the other cheek. More than once, in

the days that followed, he devoutly thanked his patron saint, caution, that his

relations with Judith had been governed by characteristic prudence. Kitty

admitted him to her coterie, but he had lost nothing of his attitude of grand

Turk towards her verses. The sin be upon the heads of whomever took such things

seriously! The irony of fate that compelled a class poet to punch cows may have

tinctured his judgment.


A telegram recalled him to the ranch and prevented a final leave-taking with

Miss Colebrooke. He made his adieux by letter, and they were frankly regretful.

Miss Colebrooke’s reply mingled sorrow in parting from her old friend

with joy in having found him. Her letter, a masterpiece of phrase-spinning,

presented to Peter the one significant fact that she would not be averse to the

renewal of his suit. In reading her letter he made no allowance for the fact

that the lady had made a fine art of saying things, and that her joy and regret

at their meeting and parting might have been reminiscent of the printed passion

that was so prominent a feature of magazinedom. Her letters—the like of

them he had never seen outside printed volumes of letters that had achieved the

distinction of classics—culminated in the one that Judith had given him

that morning, announcing that unexpectedly she had decided to join the Wetmore

girls and would be glad to see him at the ranch.


That he had flown at her bidding, Judith knew. What she would least have

suspected was that Miss Colebrooke had received her visitor as if his breakneck

ride across the desert had been in the nature of an afternoon call. If Judith,

knowing what she did of this long-drawn-out romance, could have known likewise

of her knight’s chagrin, would she have pitied him?


Ignorant of the recent anticlimax, and with a burden of many heavy thoughts,

Judith was penetrating a world of unleavened desolation. Beneath the scourge of

the noon-day sun the desert lay, stripped of every illusion. Vegetation had

almost ceased, nothing but sun-scorched, dust-choked sage-brush could spring

from such sterility. The fruit of desolation, it gave back to desolation a

quality more melancholy than utter barrenness. Glittering in the sunlight, the

beds of alkali gleamed leper white; above them the agitated air was like the

hot waves that dance and quiver about iron at white heat. From horizon to

horizon the curse of God seemed to have fallen on the land; it was as if,

cursing it, He had forgotten it, and left it as the abomination of desolation.

Judith scarce heeded, her thoughts straying after first one then another of the

group that made up her little world—Peter Hamilton, Kitty Colebrooke,

Jim, his family—thoughts inconsequent as the dancing dust-devils that

whirled over that infinity of space, and, whirling, disappeared and reappeared

at some new corner of the compass.


The trail that she must take to Jim’s camp in the mountain was known to

but few honest men. Fugitives from justice—the grave, impersonal justice

of the law, or the swift justice of the plains—found there an asylum. And

while they sometimes suffered, in death by thirst or hunger, a sentence more

dreadful than the law of the land or the law of the rope would have given them,

the desert, like the sea, seldom gave up her own. It was more than probable

that no woman except Alida Rodney had ever taken that trail before, and

reasonably certain that no woman had ever taken it alone. Dolly, when she saw

the beds of alkali grow more frequent, and that the trails of the range cattle

turned back, sniffed the lack of water in the air, slackened her pace, and

turned an interrogatory ear towards her mistress.


“It’s all right, old girl”; the gauntleted hand patted the

satin neck. “We’re in for”—Judith flung her head up and

confronted the infinite desolation yawning to the sky-line—“God

knows what.”


Dolly broke into a light canter; this evidently was not an occasion for

dawdling. There was a touch of business about the way the reins were held that

made the mare settle down to work. But her flying hoofs made little apparent

progress against the space and silence of the desert. Five, ten, fifteen miles

and the curving shoulder of the mountain, that she must cross, still mocked in

the distance. Only the sun moved in that vast world of seemingly immutable

forces.


There was no stoic Sioux in Judith now. The girl that breasted the crests of

the foot-hills shrank in terror from the loneliness and the suggestion of foes

lurking in ambush. The sun dropped behind the mountain, leaving a blood-red

pool in his wake, like fugitive Cain. Already night was sweeping over the earth

from mountain shadows that flowed imperceptibly together like blackened pools.

To the girl following the trail the silence was more dreadful than a chorus of

threatening voices. She listened till the stillness beat at her ears like the

stamping of ten thousand hoofs, then pulled up her horse, and the desert was as

still as the chamber of death.


“Ah, Dolly, my dear, a house is the place for women folk when the night

comes—a house, the fire burning clear, the kettle singing,

and—” Dolly whinnied an affirmative without waiting for the picture

to be completed. The wilderness was being gradually swallowed by the shadows,

as deliberately as a snake swallows its victim. They were nearing the

mountains. The hot blasts of air from the desert blew more and more

intermittently. The breeze swept keen from the hills, towering higher and

higher, and Judith breathed deep of the piny fragrance and felt the tension of

things loosen a little.


Whitening cattle bones gleamed from the darkness, tragic reminders of hard

winters and scant pasturage, and Judith, with the Indian superstition that was

in the marrow of her bones, read ghostly warnings in the empty eye-sockets of

the grinning skulls that stared up at her. She dared not think of the dangers

that the looming darkness might conceal, or of what she might find at her

journey’s end, or—“Whoa, Dolly! softly, girl. Is it my

foolish, white-blood nerves, or is some one following?”


The mare had been trained to respond to the slightest touch on her mouth, and

stopped instantly. Judith swayed slightly in the saddle with the heaving of the

sweating horse. The blood beat at her temples, confusing what she actually

heard with what her imagination pictured. She was half-way up a towering spur

of the Wind River when she slid from the saddle, and putting her ear to the

ground listened, Indian fashion. Above the throbbing stillness of the desert

night, that came to her murmurously, like the imprisoned roar of the sea from a

shell, she could hear the regular beat of horse’s hoofs following up the

steep mountain grade. She scrambled up with the desperate nimbleness of a

hunted thing, but when she attempted to vault to the saddle her limbs failed

and she sank clinging to the pommel. Twice she tried and twice the trembling of

her limbs held her captive. With the loss of each moment the beat of the hoofs

on the trail below became more distinct. The very desperation of her plight

kept her clinging to the pommel, incapable of thought, so that when she finally

flung herself to the saddle she was surprised to find herself there. To the

left the trail dropped sharply to a precipice, choked by the close crowding of

many scrub pines. To the right the snow-clad spires of the Wind River kept

their eternal vigil. If she should call aloud for help, these white, still

mountains would echo the anguish of her woman’s cry and give no further

heed to her plight.


The trail had begun to widen. The horse behind her again stumbled, loosening a

stone that rolled with crashes and echoings down to the precipice below. She

took advantage of the widening of the trail to urge Dolly forward. Her impulse

was to put spurs to the mare and run, to take chances with loose stones, a

narrowing trail, and the possibility of Dolly’s stumbling and breaking a

leg; but discretion prompted the showing of a brave front, the pleasantries of

the road, with flight as the last resource of desperation.


Suddenly gaining what seemed to be a plateau, she wheeled and waited the coming

of this possible friend or foe. The thudding of hoofs through the inferno of

darkness stopped, as the rider below considered the latest move of the horseman

above. They were so near that Judith could hear the labored breathing of the

sweating horse. The blackness of the night had become a tangible thing. The

towering mountains were one piece with the gaping precipice, the trail, the

scrub pines, the gauntlet on her hand. The horse below resumed its stumbling

gait. Judith crowded Dolly close to the rocky wall. If the chance comrade of

the wilderness should pass her by in the darkness—God speed him!


“What the devil are you blocking the trail for?” sung out a voice

from the darkness. At sound of it Judith’s heart stopped beating. The

voice was Peter Hamilton’s.


XI.

The Cabin In The Valley


And Judith, taken unawares by the unexpected turn of things, comforted as a

lost child that is found, told all her feeling for him in the way she called

his name. The easy tenderness of the man awoke; his senses swayed to the magic

of her voice, the mystery of the night, the shadow world in which they two,

’twixt earth and sky, were alone. They rode without speaking.

Peter’s hand sought hers, and all her woman’s terror of the

desolation, her fear of the vague terrors of the dreadful night, spoke in her

answering pressure. It was as if the desert had given them to each other as

they groped through the silent darkness. In the great company of earth, sky,

silence, and this great-hearted woman, Peter grew conscious of a real thrill.

There were depths to life—vast, still depths; this woman’s

unselfish love for him made him realize them. He felt his soul sweeping out on

the great tide of things. Farther and farther it swept; his patron saint,

caution, beckoning frantically from the receding shore, was miles behind.

“Judith!” he said, and he scarce recognized his own voice.

“Judith!” he struggled as a swimmer in a drowning clutch. Then his

patron saint threw him a life-line and he saved the situation.


“Judith!” he said, a third time, and now he knew his voice. It was

the voice of the man who tilted at life picturesquely in a broad-brimmed hat,

who loved his darling griefs and fitted them as a Rembrandt fits its

background. And still, in the same voice, the voice he knew, he said: “I

feel as if we had died and our souls were meeting. You know Aldrich’s

exquisite lines:


“Somewhere in desolate, wind-swept space,

    In twilight land—no man’s land—

Two hurrying shapes met face to face

    And bade each other stand.


“‘And who are you?’ cried one, agape,

    Shuddering in the gloaming light.

I know not,’ said the other shape,

    ‘I only died last night.’”


“‘I only died last night!’” she repeated the line,

slowly, significantly. In her questioning she forgot the night, the desolation,

the presence of the man. Had she died last night? Had youth, the joy of living,

her infinite capacity for love, had they died when Peter, with the ugly haste

of the man without a nice sense of the time that should elapse between the old

and the new love, had spurred away cheerfully at the beck of another woman? And

now the desert, this earth-mother as she called it, in the Indian way, had

given him back to her, thrown them together as driftwood in the still ocean of

space. She drew a long breath, the breath of one waking from an anguished

dream. A wild, unreasoning gladness woke in her heart, the joy of living swept

her back again to life. She had not died last night, she was riding through the

wilderness with Peter.


“Look!” she whispered. The sky had lost its forbidding blackness.

The sharp notches of the mountains, faintly outlined in white, undulated

through an eternity of space. Venus hung in the west, burning softly as a

shaded lamp. The trail they climbed seemed to end in her pale yellow light.


Peter had saved the situation, but the wild beauty of the night stirred in him

that gift of silvery speech that was ever his tribute to the sex, rather than

the woman. He bent towards Judith. A loosened strand of her hair blew across

his cheek. The breakneck ride to Kitty was already the madness of a dead and

gone incarnation. He pointed to the pale star, and told her it was the omen of

their destiny; the formless blackness through which they had groped was the way

of life, but for such as were not condemned to eternal darkness Venus held high

her lamp and they scaled the heights.


And Judith, listening, found her heart a battle-field of love and hate.

“Were women dogs, that men should play with them in idle moods, caress

them, and fling them out for other toys?” she demanded of herself, even

while the tones of his voice melted her innermost being to thankfulness for

this hour that he was wholly hers.


Gayly, with ready turns of speech and snatches of song, trolled in his musical

barytone, Peter rode through the night, even as he rode through life, a Sir

Knight of the Joyous Heart, unbrushed by the wing of sorrow, loving his pale

griefs for the values they gave the picture. And Judith understood by reason of

that exquisite perception that was hers in all matters pertaining to him, and,

knowing, only loved the more.


Down the valley came the sharp yelp of a coyote, and in a moment the towering

crags had taken it up, the echo repeating it and giving it back to the valley,

where the coyote barked again at the shadow of his voice. The night was full of

the eerie laughter. Peter put a restraining hand on Dolly’s bridle, and,

waiting for the coyote to stop, called Judith’s name, and all the

mountains made music of it. The echo sang the old Hebrew name as if it had been

a psalm. Peter’s voice gave it to the mountains joyously, but the

mountains gave it back in the minor. And Judith was reminded of the soft,

singing syllables that her mother, in the Indian way, had made of her

daughter’s Indian name. The remembrance tugged at her heart. In her joy

at seeing Peter she had forgotten that the errand that had brought her was an

errand of life and death—life and death for her brother!


But Peter’s ready enthusiasms pressed him hard. Surely love-making was

the business of such a night. “Ah, Judith, goddess of the heights, if I

could sing your name like the mountains, would you love me a little?”


For his pains he had a flash of white teeth in a smile that recalled his first

acquaintance with Kitty, the sort of smile one would give to a “nice

boy” when his manœuvres were a trifle obvious. “Not if you sang my

name as the chorus of all the Himalayas and the Rockies and Andes, and with the

fire of all their volcanoes and the beauty of their snows and the strength of

all their hills, for it’s not my way to love a little!”


He bent towards her; to brush her cheek lightly as they rode was but to imply

his appreciation of the scene as a bit of chiaroscuro, the panorama of the

desert night, eternal romance typified by the man and woman scaling the

heights, the goddess of love lighting them on their way by her flaming torch.

But Judith, who said little because she felt much, was in no mood to brook such

dalliance, and, urging the mare sharply, she cantered down the divide at peril

of life and limb. Peter, cursing the heavy-footed beast he rode, came stumbling

after.


Judith rode wildly through the night, leaving Peter laps behind, to beseech, to

prophesy dire happening if she should slip, and to scramble after, as best he

might, on the heavy-footed beast he repudiated, with all his ancestors, as

oxen, to the fourth generation. But the woman kept her pace. She had stern

questions to put to herself, and they were likely to have truer answers if

Peter were elsewhere than riding beside her. Whither was he going? They had met

casually on a trail known to few honest men. It led over a spur of the Wind

River to a sort of no man’s land, the hiding-place of horse and cattle

thieves. She had gone to warn her brother. Could he be going there—She

could not bring herself to finish.


Her heart was divided against itself. Within it were fought again the red and

the white man’s battles, bitterly, and to the finish. And now the white

man, with his open warfare, won, and all her love rose up and scourged her

little faith. She would wait on the trail for Peter, penitent and ashamed. And

while she waited suspicions bred of her Indian blood stirred distrustfully, and

she told herself that her mother’s daughter made a worthy champion of the

ways of white men. Did Hamilton hunt her brother gallowsward, making merry with

her the meantime? He had not even been courteously concerned as to where she

was going when they met on the divide. They had met and ridden together as

casually as if it had been the most natural thing for them both to be taking

the horse-thief trail as a summer evening’s ride. And she had not thought

to wonder at his possible destination, when the man from whom she rode in

terror through the night proved to be Peter, because the lesser question of his

errand had been swallowed up in the greater miracle of his presence.


She was by this time well down the divide. The temperature had risen

perceptibly on the down grade. The heat of the plains had already mingled with

the cool hill air; the heights, where Venus kept her love vigil, were already

past. Judith gave Dolly a breathing spell, herself lounging easily meanwhile.

She knew how to take her ease in the saddle as well as any cow-puncher on the

range.


“The Hayoka has dominion over me,” she mused, with Indian fatalism.

“As well resign myself to sorrow with dignity. Hayoka,

Hayo—ka!” and she began to croon softly a hymn of propitiation to

the Hayoka, the Sioux god of contrariety. According to the legends, he sat

naked and fanned himself in a Dakota blizzard and huddled, shivering, over a

fire in the heat of summer. Likewise the Hayoka cried for joy and laughed for

sorrow.


She remembered how the nuns at Santa Fé had been shocked at her for praying to

Indian gods, and how once she had built a little mound of stones, which was the

Sioux way of making petition, in the shadow of the statue of the Virgin Mary,

and how Sister Angela had scattered the stones and told her to pray instead to

the Blessed Lady. She still prayed to the Blessed Lady every day; but

sometimes, too, she reared little mounds of stones in the desert when she was

very sad and the kinship between her and the dead gods of her mother’s

people seemed the closer for their common sorrow.


Peter, coming up with a much-blown horse, found her still chanting the Indian

song.


“Sing him a verse for me, Judith. Heaven knows I need something to

straighten out my infernal luck. Tell the Hayoka that I’m a good fellow

and need only half a chance. Tell him to prosper my present venture.”


She had begun to chant the invocation, then stopped suddenly. “I must

not; you know I am a Catholic.” Suspicion that had been scotched, not

killed, raised its head. “What was his present venture?” Her eye

had not changed in expression, nor a tone of her voice, but in her heart was a

sickening distrust for all things.


A belated moon had come up. The level plain, on which their horses threw

grotesque, elongated shadows, was flooded with honey-colored light. Each

straggling clump of sage-brush, whitening bone and bowlder, gleamed mysterious,

ghostly in the radiant flood-tide. They seemed to be riding through a world

that had no kinship with that black, formless void through which they had

groped but yet a little while. Then darkness had been upon the face of the

deep. Now there was a miracle of light such as only the desert, in its

desolation, knows. To Judith, with a soul attuned to every passing expression

of nature, there was significance in this transition from darkness to light.

The sudden radiance was emblematic of her belated perception, coming as it did

after a blindness so dense as to appear almost wilful. Her mind was busy with a

multitude of schemes. Fool though she had been, she would not be the instrument

of her brother’s undoing.


“I’ve come too far,” she cried, in sudden dismay. “I

should have stopped at the foot of the divide. I’ve never been over the

trail before.”


“You foolish child, why should you stop in the middle of the

wilderness?”


She wheeled the mare about and faced him, a figure of graven resolution.


“I promised to meet Tom Lorimer there—now you know.”


With which she cracked Dolly sharply with her heel and began to retrace her way

over the trail. Peter turned his horse and followed, with the feeling of utter

helplessness that a man has when confronted with the granite obstinacy of

women. Judith had meanwhile expected that the announcement of her mythical

appointment with Tom Lorimer would be received differently. Tom Lorimer’s

reputation was of the worst. An Eastern man formerly, an absconder from

justice, rumor was busy with tales of ungodly merrymaking that went on at his

ranch, where no woman went except painted wisps from the dance-halls. But Peter

was too loyal a friend, despite his shortcomings as a lover, to see in

Judith’s statement anything more than a sisterly devotion so deeply

unselfish that it failed to take into account the danger to which she subjected

herself.


However, it was plainly his duty to prevent an unprotected rendezvous with

Lorimer, to reason, to plead, and, if he should fail to bring her to a

reasonable frame of mind, to go with her, come what would of the result. There

were reasons innumerable why he, a cattle-man, should avoid the appearance of

dealing with the sheep faction, he reflected, grimly. Lorimer owned sheep, many

thousand head. His herds had been allowed to graze unmolested, while smaller

owners, like Jim Rodney, had been crowded out because his influence,

politically, was a thing to be reckoned with. So Peter followed Judith,

pleading Judith’s cause; she did not understand, he told her, what she

was doing; and while perhaps there was not another man in the country who would

not honor her unselfishness in coming to him, Lorimer’s chivalry was not

a thing to be reckoned with, drunken beast that he was. And Judith, worn with

the struggle, tried beyond measure, made reckless by the daily infusion of

ill-fortune, pulled up the mare and laughed unpleasantly.


“You think I’m going to see Lorimer about Jim? I’m going with

him to a merrymaking. We’re old pals, Lorimer and I.”


“Judith, dear, has it come to this, that you not only distrust an old

friend, but that you try to degrade yourself to hide from him the fact that you

are going to your brother’s? You’ve never spoken to Lorimer. I

heard him say, not a week ago, that he had never succeeded in making you

recognize him. You deceived me at first when you spoke of meeting him—I

thought you had a message from Jim—but this talk of merrymaking is

beneath you.” He shrugged his shoulders in disgust. He felt the torrent

of grief that rent her. No sob escaped her lips; there was no convulsive

movement of shoulder. She rode beside him, still as the desert before the

sand-storm breaks, her soul seared with white-hot iron that knows no saving

grace of sob or tear. She rode as Boadicea might have ridden to battle; there

was not a yielding line in her body. But over and over in her woman’s

heart there rang the cry: “I am so tired! If the long night would but

come!”


Peter drew out his watch. “It’s a quarter to eleven. We’ll

have a hard bit of riding to reach Blind Creek before midnight.”


Then he knew as well as she, perhaps better, the route to Jim’s

hiding-place; she had never been there as yet. And if Peter knew, doubtless

every cattle-man in the country knew. What a fool she had been with her talk of

meeting Tom Lorimer! A sense of utter defeat seemed to paralyze her energies.

She felt like a trapped thing that after eluding its pursuers again and again

finds that it has been but running about a corral. Physical weariness was

telling on her. She had been in the saddle since a little past noon and it was

now not far from midnight. And still there was the unanswered question of

Peter’s errand. It was long since either had broken the silence. A

delicious coolness had crept into the air with the approach of midnight.

Judith, breathing deep draughts of it, reminded herself of the stoicism that

was hers by birthright.


“Peter”—her voice lost some of its old ring, but it had a

deeper note—“Peter, we make strange comrades, you and I, in a

stranger world. We meet on Horse-Thief Trail, and there is reason to suppose

that our errands are inimical. You’ve pierced all my little pretences;

you know that I am going to my brother, who is an outlaw—my brother, the

rope for whose hanging is already cut. And yet we have been friends these many

years, and we meet in this world of desolation and weigh each other’s

words, and there is no trust in our hearts. Our little faith is more pitiful

than the cruel errands that bring us. I take it you, too, are going to my

brother’s?”


“I’m going there to see that you arrive safe and sound, but I had

no intention of going when I left camp. You’ve brought me a good twenty

miles out of my way, not to mention accusing me of ulterior motives. Now,

aren’t you penitent?” He smiled at her, boyish and irresistible. To

Judith it was more reassuring than an oath. “It’s like dogs

fighting over a picked bone; the meat’s all gone. The range is

overworked; it needs a good, long rest.” He turned towards Judith,

speaking slowly. “What you have said is true. We’re friends before

we’re partisans of either faction. I’m on my way to a round-up.

There’s been an unexpected order to fill a beef contract—a thousand

steers. We’re going to furnish five hundred, the XXX two hundred and

fifty, and the “Circle-Star” two hundred and fifty. Men have been

scouring the enemy’s country for days rounding up stragglers. It will go

hard with the rustlers after this round-up, Judith.”


She felt a great wave of penitence and shame sweep over her. She had not

trusted him; in her heart she had nourished hideous suspicions of him, and he

was telling her, quite simply, of the plans of his own faction, trusting her,

as, indeed, he might, but as she never expected to be trusted.


“Peter, do you know that sometimes I think Jim has gone quite mad with

these range troubles. He’s acted strangely ever since his sheep were

driven over the cliff. He’s not been home to Alida and the children since

he has been out of jail, and you know how devoted to them he has always been!

He spends all his time tracking Simpson. Alida wrote me that she expects him

to-night, and I’m going there on the chance.”


“It’s the devil’s own hole for desolation that he’s

come to.” Peter looked about the cup-shaped valley that was but a

cul-de-sac in the mountains. Its approach was between the high rock walls of a

cañon. Passing between them, the rise of temperature was almost incredible. The

great barrier of mountain-range, that cut it off from the rest of the world,

seemed also to cut it off from light and air. The atmosphere hung lifeless, the

occasional bellow of range-cattle sounded far-off and muffled. Vegetation was

scant, the sage-brush grew close and scrubby, even the brilliant cactus flowers

seemed to have abandoned the valley to its fate. A lone group of dead

cotton-woods grew like sentinels close to the rocky walls. Their twisted

branches, gaunt and bare, writhed upward as if in dumb supplication. There was

about them a something that made Judith come closer to Peter as they passed

them by. The night wind sang in their leafless branches with a long-drawn,

shuddering sigh. The despair of a barren, deserted thing seemed to have settled

on them.


“Those frightful trees, how can Alida stand them?” She looked back.

“Oh, I wish they were cut down!”


Before them was the cabin, its ruined condition pitifully apparent even by

night. It had been deserted ten years before Jim brought his family to it.

Rumor said it was haunted. Grim stories were told of the death of a woman who

had come there with a man, and had not lived to go away with him. The roof of

the adjoining stable had fallen in, the bars of the corral were missing. The

house was dark but for a feeble light that glimmered in one window, the beacon

that had been lighted, night after night, against Jim’s coming. It added

a further note of apprehension, peering through the dark, still valley like a

wakeful, anxious eye, keeping a long and unrewarded vigil. Judith felt the

consummation of the threatening tragedy after her first glimpse of the sentinel

trees. She could not explain, but her heart cried, even as the wind in them had

sung of death. Perhaps her mother’s spirit spoke to her, just as she had

said, on that memorable drive, that the Great Mystery spoke to his people in

the earth, the sky, and the frowning mountains.


“Peter”—she had slid from her horse and was clinging to his

arm—“when it happens, Peter, you will have no part in it?”


“It won’t happen, Judith, if I can help it.”


She kissed his hand as it held the loose reins.


“Lord, I am not worthy!” was the thought in his heart. He sat

graven in the saddle. Sir Knight of the Joyous Heart though he was, the

unsought kiss of trust gifted him with a self-reverence that would not soon

forsake him.


Judith was rapping on the door and calling to Alida not to be frightened. And

presently it was opened. Peter wanted to leave Judith, now that she was safely

at the end of her journey, but she would not hear of it till he had eaten.


“You would have had your comfortable supper five hours ago had you not

been playing cavalier to me all over the wilderness.” And Peter yielded.


Judith busied herself about the kitchen. Her mood of racking apprehension had

disappeared. Indian stoicism had again the guiding hand. She waved Peter from

the fire that she was kindling, as if he were a blundering incompetent. But she

let him slice the bacon and grind the coffee as one lets a child help. Alida

came in, white-faced and anxious over the long absence of her husband, but

conscientiously hospitable nevertheless. Peter noticed that Judith made a

gallant pretence of eating, crumbling her bread and talking the meanwhile. The

pale wife, who had little to say at the best of times, was put to the test to

say anything at all. But, withal, their intent was so genuinely hospitable that

Peter himself could not speak with the pity of it. Accustomed as he was to the

roughness of these frontier cabins, never had he seen a human habitation so

desolate as this. The mud plaster had fallen away from between the logs,

showing cross sections of the melancholy prospect. An atmosphere of tragedy

brooded over the place. Whether from its long period of emptiness, or from the

vaguely hinted murder of the woman who had died there, or whether it took its

character from the prevailing desolation, the cabin in the valley was an

unlovely thing. Nor did the cleanliness, the conscientious making the best of

things, soften the woful aspect of the place. Rather was the appeal the more

poignant to the seeing eye, as the brave makeshift of the self-respecting poor

strikes deeper than the beggar’s whine. The house was bare but for the

few things that Alida could take in the wagon in which they made their flight.

And all through the pinch of poverty and grinning emptiness there was visible

the woman-touch, the brave making the best of nothing, the pitiful preparation

for the coming of the man. Wild roses from the creek bloomed against the

gnarled and weather-warped logs of the walls. Sprays of clematis trailed their

white bridal beauty from cans rescued from the ashes of a camp-fire. But Alida

was a strategist when it came to adorning her home, and the rusty receptacle

was hid beneath trailing green leaves. There was at the window a muslin curtain

that in its starched and ruffled estate was strongly suggestive of a

child’s frock hastily converted into a window drapery. The curtain was

drawn aside that the lamp might shed its beam farther on the way of the

traveller who came not. There was but one other light in the place, a bit of

candle. Alida apologized for the poor light by which they must eat, but she did

not offer to take the lamp from the window.


Peter was no longer Sir Knight of the Joyous Heart as he watched the little,

white-faced woman, who went so often to the door to look towards the road that

entered the valley that she was no longer aware of what she did. He saw her

wide eyes full of fear, the bow of the mouth strained taut with anxiety, her

unconscious fear of him as one of the alien faction, and withal her concern for

his comfort. Judith’s control was far greater, but though she hid it

skilfully, he knew the sorrow that consumed her.


There was a cry from the room beyond, and Judith, snatching up the candle, went

in to the children. All three of them were sleeping cross-ways in one bed,

their small, round arms and legs striking out through the land of dreams as

swimmers breasting the waves. She gave a little cry of delight and

appreciation, and called Peter to look. Little Jim, who had cried in some

passing fear, sat up sleepily. He stretched out his small arms to Peter, whom

he had never seen before. Peter took him, and again he settled to sleep,

apparently assured that he was in friendly hands.


The warm, small body, giving itself with perfect confidence, strongly affected

Peter’s heightened susceptibilities. In the very nature of the situation

he could be no friend to Jim Rodney, yet here in his arms lay Jim

Rodney’s son, loving, trusting him instinctively. Judith noticed that his

face paled beneath its many coats of tan. He was afraid of the little sleeping

boy, afraid that his unaccustomed touch might hurt him, and yet loath to part

with the small burden. Judith took the boy from Peter and placed him between

the two little girls on the bed.


Through the window they could see Alida’s dress glimmering, like a

phantom in the darkness, as she strained her eyes towards the path. Peter hated

to leave the women and children in this desolate place. The night was far

spent. To reach the round-up in season, he could at best snatch a couple of

hours’ sleep and be again in the saddle while the stars still shone. His

saddle and saddle blanket were enough for him. The broad canopy of heaven, the

bosom of mother earth, had given him sound, dreamless sleep these many years.

He bade the women good-night, and made his bed where the cañon gave entrance to

the valley. But sleep was slow to come. Now, in that vague, uncertain world

where we fall through oceans of space, and the waking is the dream, the dream

the waking, Peter caught pale flashes of Kitty’s gold head as she ran and

ran, ever in the pursuit of something, she knew not what. And as she ran hither

and thither, she would turn her head and beckon to Peter, and as he followed he

felt the burden of years come upon him. And then he saw Judith’s eyes,

still and grave. He turned and wakened. No, it was not Judith’s eyes, but

the stars above the mountain-tops.


XII.

The Round-up


The stars were still shining when Peter Hamilton looked at his watch next

morning, but he sternly fought the temptation to lie another two minutes by

remembering the day’s work before him, and went in search of the horse

that he had not picketed overnight, as the beast required a full belly after

the hard night’s ride he had given him. Peter had rolled out of his

blankets with a keen anticipatory relish for the day ahead. It was well, he

knew, that there was ample work of a definite nature for Peter the cow-puncher;

as for Peter the man, he was singularly at sea. Had Judith Rodney been his

desert comrade all these cheerful years for him to get his first belated

insight into the real Judith only a few little hours back? Or was it, he

wondered, her seeming unconsciousness of him, as she rode brave and sorrowful

through the night, to avert, if might be, her brother’s death—at

all events, to comfort and inspirit the frightened woman and her little

children—that had freshly tinged the friendship he had so long felt for

her? Many were the questions that Peter vaguely put to himself as he started

out for his long day in the saddle; and none of them he answered. Indeed, he

could not satisfactorily explain to himself why he should think of Judith at

all in this way—Judith, whom he had known so long, and upon whom he

counted so securely—Judith, who understood things, and was as good a

comrade as a man. Surely it was a strange thing that he should discover himself

in a sentimental dream of Judith!


For it was in such dreams that Katherine Colebrooke had figured ever since

Peter could remember. For years, indeed—and Judith knew it!—he had

stood, tame and tractable, waiting for Chloe to throw her dainty lariat. But

Chloe had intimated that her graceful fingers were engaged with the inkpot and

her head with schemes for further sonneting. Chloe was becoming famous. To

Peter, who was unmodern, there was little to be gained in arguing against a

state of affairs so crassly absurd as career-getting for women. At such seasons

it behooved sane men to pray for patience rather than the gift of tongues. When

the disheartened fair should weary of the phantom pursuit, then might the man

of patience have his little day. Peter winced at the picture. To the world he

knew that his long waiting on the brink of the bog, while his ambitious lady

floundered after false lights, was, in truth, no more impressive a spectacle

than the anguished squawking of a hen who watches a brood of ducklings, of her

own hatching, try their luck in the pond.


And there was Judith the great-hearted, Judith who was as inspiring as a breath

of hill air, Judith with no thought of careers beyond the loyal doing of her

woman’s part, Judith, trusty and loyal—and Judith with that

accursed family connection!


Peter tightened his cinch and turned his horse westward. The stars had grown

dim in the sky. The world that the night before had seemed to float in a

silvery effulgence looked gray and old. The cabin in the valley flaunted its

wretched squalor, like a beggar seeking alms on the highway. Riding by, Peter

lifted his sombrero. “Sweet dreams, gentle lady!” He dug the rowel

into his horse’s side and began his day at no laggard pace. Nor did he

spare his horse in the miles that lay between him and breakfast. The beast

would have no more work to do that day, when once he reached camp, and Peter

was not in his tenderest mood as he spurred through the gray of the morning.

The pale, chastened world was all his own at this hour. Not a creature was

stirring. The mountains, the valleys, the softly huddled hills slept in the

deep hush that is just before the dawn. He looked about with questioning eyes.

Last night this very road had been a pale silver thread winding from the

mountain crests into a world of dreams. To-day it was but a trail across the

range. “Where are the snows of yester year?” he quoted, with a

certain early-morning grimness. At heart he was half inclined to believe Judith

responsible for the vanished world; Judith, Judith—he was riding away

from her as fast as his horse could gallop, and yet his thoughts perversely

lingered about the cabin in the valley.


After a couple of hours’ hard riding he could dimly make out specks

moving on that huge background of space, and presently his horse neighed and

put fresh spirit into his gait, recognizing his fellows in moving dots on the

vast perspective. And being a beast of some intelligence, for all his

heavy-footed failings, he reasoned that food and rest would soon be his

portion. Peter had no further use for the rowel.


Breakfast was already well under way when he reached camp. The outfit, seated

on saddles in a semicircle about the chuck wagon, ate with that peculiar

combination of haste and skill that doubtless the life of the saddle

counteracts, as digestive troubles are apparently unknown among plainsmen. The

cook, in handing Peter his tin plate, cup, spoon, and black-handled fork, asked

him if “he would take overland trout or Cincinnati chicken, this

morning?” The cook never omitted these jocular inquiries regarding the

various camp names for bacon. He seemed to think that a choice of alias was as

good as a change of menu. There was little talk at breakfast, and that bearing

chiefly on the day’s work. Every one was impatient for an early start.

The horse wrangler had his string waiting, the cook was scouring his iron pots,

saddles were thrown over horses fresh from a long night’s good grazing,

cinches were tightened, slickers and blankets were adjusted, and camp melted

away in a troup of horsemen winding away through the gray of early morning.


The scene of the beef round-up was a mighty plain, affording limitless scope

for handling the cattle of a thousand hills. In the distance rose the first

undulations of the mountains, that might be likened to the surplusage of space

that rolled the length of the sweeping levels, then heaped high to the blue.

The specks in the far distance began to grow as if the screw of a field-glass

were bringing them nearer, turning them into horsemen, bunches of cattle,

“chuck-wagons” of the different outfits, reserves of horses

restrained by temporary rope-corrals, all the equipment of a great round-up.

Dozens of men, multitudes of horses, hordes of cattle—the mighty plain

swallowed all the little, prancing, galloping, bellowing things, and still

looked mighty in its loneliness. Fling a handful of toys from a Noah’s

Ark—if they make such simple toys now—in an ordinary field, and the

little, wooden men, horses and cows, will suggest the round-up in relation to

its background. Men darted hither and thither, yelling shrilly; cows—born

apparently to be leaders—broke from the bunches to which they had been

assigned and started at a clumsy run, followed by kindred susceptible to

example. Cow-punchers, waiting for just such manifestations of individuality,

whirled after them like comets, and soon they were again in the pawing,

heaving, sweltering bunch to which they belonged.


Peter Hamilton, whose particular skill as a cow-puncher lay in that branch of

the profession known as “cutting out,” found that the work of the

rustlers had been carried on with no unsparing hand since the early spring

round-up. Calves bearing the “H L” brand—that claimed by a

company known to be made up of cattle-thieves—followed mothers bearing

almost every brand that grazed herds in that part of the State. The Wetmore

outfit, that used a “W” enclosed in a square, were apparently the

heaviest losers. The cows and calves were herded at the right of the plain,

convenient to the branding-pen, the steers well away to the opposite side. As

Peter drove a “W-square” cow, followed by a little, white-faced

calf, whose brand had plainly been tampered with, he heard one of his

associates say:


“There’s nothing small about the ‘H L’ except their

methods.”


“What’s ‘H L’ stand for, anyway?” the other

cow-puncher asked.


“Why, Hell, or, How Long; depends whether you’re with ’em or

again ’em.”


Peter wheeled from the men and headed for the bunch he was cutting out. He

fancied that the man had looked at him strangely as he offered a choice of

meanings for the “H L”—and yet he could not have known that

Peter had gone to Rodney’s cabin last night. He flung himself heart and

soul into his work, dashing full tilt at the snorting, stamping bedlam,

enveloped in clouds of dust that dimmed the very daylight. Calves bleated

piteously as they were jammed in the thickening pack. Peter shouted, swung the

rope right and left, thinning the bunch about him, and a second later emerged,

driving before him a cow, followed by a calf. These were turned over to

cow-boys waiting for them. Time after time Hamilton returned to that mass of

unconscious power, that with a single rush could have annihilated the little

band of horsemen that handled them with the skill of a dealer shuffling,

cutting, dealing a pack of cards.


To the left were the steers, pawing and tearing up the earth in a very ecstasy

of impotent fury. Picture the giant propeller of an ocean liner thrashing about

in the sands of the desert and you will have an approximate knowledge of the

dust raised by a thousand steers. Their long-drawn, shrieking bellow had a

sinister note. Horns, hoofs, tails beat the air, their bloodshot eyes looked

menacingly in every direction; but a handful of cow-boys kept them in check,

circling round and round them on ponies who did their work without waiting for

quirt or rowel.


The noonday sun looked down upon a scene that to the eye unskilled in these

things was as confusion worse confounded. Cow-boys dashed from nowhere in

particular and did amazing things with a bit of rope, sending it through the

air with snaky undulations after flying cattle. The rope, taking on lifelike

coils, would pursue the flying beast like an aerial reptile, then the noose

would fall true, and the thing was done. A second later a couple of cow-boys

would be examining the disputed brand on the prone animal.


The smell of burning flesh and hair rose from the branding-pen and mingled with

the stench of the herds in one noisome compound. The yells of the cow-punchers,

each having its different bearing on the work in hand, were all but lost in the

dull, steady roar of the cattle, bellowing in a chorus of fear, rage, and pain.

And still the work of sorting, branding, cutting-out, went steadily on. Though

an outsider would not have perceived it, the work was as crisp-cut and exact in

its methods as the work in a counting-house. One of the cow-boys, in hot

pursuit of a fractious heifer, encountered a gopher-hole, and horse and rider

were down in a heap. In a second a dozen helping hands were dragging him from

under the horse. He limped painfully, but stooped to examine his horse. The

beast had broken a leg, and turned on the man eyes almost human in their pain.


“Bob, Bob!” The cow-puncher went down on his knees and put his arms

about the neck of his pet. “My God!” he said, “me and Bob was

just like brothers. Everybody knowed that.” He uncinched the saddle with

clumsy tenderness; not a man thought a whit less of him because he could not

see well at the moment. He turned his head away, that he might not see the

well-aimed shot that would release his pet from pain. Then he limped away after

another horse—it was all in the day’s work.


The beef contract called for a thousand steers, four and five years old, and

these having been well and duly counted, and some dozen extra head added in

case of accident, they were immediately started on the trail, as they could

accomplish some seven or eight miles before being bedded down for the night.

Hamilton, who had crossed to the beef side of the round-up to have a necessary

word with the “Circle-Star” foreman, was amazed to find Simpson

making ready to start with the trail herd. Peter inquired, with a few

expletives, “how long he had been a cow-man, in good and regular

standing?”


“As far as the regularity is concerned, that would be a pretty hard thing

to answer, but he’s had an interest in the ‘XXX’

since—since—”


“He drove Rodney’s sheep over the cliff?”


“Ain’t you a little hard on the beginning of his cattle career? It

usually goes by a more business-like name, but—” he shrugged his

shoulders—“it’s up to the ‘XXX.’ We

wouldn’t have him help to pull bogged cattle out of a creek.”


The beeves, hidden in a simoom of their own stamping, were gradually being

pressed forward on the trail, a huge pawn, ignorant of its own strength,

manipulated by a handful of men and horses. Its bellowing, like the tuning of a

thousand bass-fiddles, shook the stillness like the long, sullen roar of the

sea, as out of the plain they thundered, to feed the multitude.


“Well, there goes as pretty a bunch of porterhouses as I’d want to

put tooth to. If I get away from here within the next two months, as I’m

expecting, doubtless I’ll meet some of you again with your personality

somewhat obscured by reason of fried onions.”


The foreman of the “Circle-Star” waved his hand after the slowly

moving herd that gradually pressed forward like an army in loose marching

order. Outriders galloped ahead, like darting insects, and pointing the

lumbering mass that trailed its half-mile length at a snail’s-pace. The

great column steadily advanced, checked, turned, led as easily as a child

trails his little steam-cars after him on the nursery floor, and always by the

little force of a handful of men and a few horses.


After supper came general relaxation around the camp-fire. The men, who had all

day been strung to a keen pitch of nervous energy, lounged in loose,

picturesque uncouthness, while each began to unravel his own lively miscellany

of information or invention. There was jest, laughter, spinning of yarns,

singing of songs. As Peter lay in the fire-light, smoking his brier-wood, he

noticed that the man next him spent a great deal of time poring over a letter,

holding it close to the blaze, now at arm’s-length, which was hardly

surprising, considering the penmanship of the more common variety of

billet-doux. The man was plainly disappointed that Peter would not notice or

comment. Finally he folded it up, and with sentimental significance returned it

to the left side pocket of his flannel shirt, and remarked to Peter,

“It’s from her.”


“Indeed,” said Peter, who had not the faintest notion who

“her” could be. “Let me congratulate you.”


“Yes, sir,” and there was conviction in the cow-puncher’s

tone; “it’s from old man Kinson’s girl, up to the Basin, and

the parson’s goin’ to give us the life sentence soon. A man gets

sick o’ helling it all over creation.” He rolled a cigarette, lit

it, took a puff or two, then turned to Peter, as one whose acquaintance with

the broader side of life entitled him to speak with a certain authority.

“Is it that, or is it that we’re getting on, a little long in the

tooth, logy in our movements?”


“I think we’re just sick of helling it.” Peter looked towards

the star that last night had been the beacon towards which he and Judith had

scaled the heights. “Yes, we get sick of helling it after we’ve

turned thirty.”


“Then I can’t be making a mistake. If I thought it was because I

was getting on, I’d stampede this here range. It don’t seem fair to

a girl to allow that you’re broke, tamed, and know the way to the corral,

when it’s just that you’re needin’ to go to an old

man’s home.”


“Now this is really love,” said Peter to himself, with interest.

“This is humility.” A sympathetic liking for the self-distrustful

lover surged hot and generous into Peter’s heart, and he continued to

himself: “Now that’s what Judith would appreciate in a man, some

directness, some humility!” Poor Judith! Poor burden-bearer! Who was to

love her as she deserved to be loved, even as old man Kinson’s girl, of

the Basin, was loved? Yet suppose some one did love her in such fashion and she

returned it? It was a picture Peter had never conjured up before. Nonsense! he

was accustomed to think of Judith a great deal, and that was not the way to

think of her. “Dear Judith!” said Peter, half unconsciously to

himself, and looked again at the fellow, who had gone back to his dingy letter

and continued to reread it in the fire-light as if he hoped to extract some

further meaning from the now familiar words. Nature had fitted him out with a

rag-bag assortment of features—the nose of a clown, the eyes of a ferret,

the mouth that hangs agape like a badly hinged door, the mouth of the incessant

talker. And withal, as he lounged in the fire-light, dreamily turning his

love-letter, he had a sort of superphysical beauty, reflected of the glow that

many waters cannot quench.


Costigan, who had led the merriment against Simpson at Mrs. Clark’s

eating-house, was playing “mumbly-peg” with Texas Tyler. They had

been working like Trojans all day at the round-up, but they pitched their

pocket-knives with as keen a zest as school-boys, bickering over points in the

game, accusing each other of cheating, calling on the rest of the company to

umpire some disputed point.


But presently, from the opposite side of the fire, some one began to sing, in a

rich barytone, a dirgelike thing that caught the attention of first one then

another of the men, making them stop their yarning and knife-throwing to

listen. The tune, in its homely power to evoke the image of the ceremonial of

death, was more or less familiar to most of them. There was a conscious funeral

pageantry in the ring of its measured phrases that recalled to many burials of

the dead that had taken place in their widely scattered homes. Mrs.

Barbauld’s hymn, “Flee as a Bird to the Mountain,” are the

words usually sung to the air.


Costigan presently cut across the dirgelike refrain with: “Phwat

th’ divil is ut about that chune that Oi’m thinkin’

of?”


“This,” said the man with the barytone voice, “is the tune

that Nick Steele saved his neck to.”


“Begorra, that’s ut. I wasn’t there mesilf, but Oi’ve

heard th’ story told more times than Oi’ve years to me

credit.”


“My father was in that necktie party,” spoke up a young

cow-puncher, “and I’ve heard him tell the story scores of times,

and he always wondered why the devil they let Steele off. Never could

understand it after the thing was done. He was talking of it once to a man who

was a sharp on things like mesmerism, and the man called it hypnotic

suggestion. Said that Steele got control of the whole outfit and mesmerized

’em so they couldn’t do a thing to him.”


Several of the men asked for the story, echoes of which had come down through

all the forty years since its happening. And the cow-puncher, lighting a

cigarette, began:


“It was in the good old forty-nine days in California, when gold was

sometimes more plentiful than bread, and women were so scarce that one day when

they found a girl’s shoe on the trail they fitted a gold heel to it and

put it up in camp to worship. But sentiment wasn’t exactly their long

suit, and any little difficulties that cropped up were straightened out by the

vigilance committee—and a rope. One day a saddle, or maybe it was a gun,

that didn’t belong to him, was found among this man Steele’s traps,

and though he swore that some one had put it there for a grudge, the committee

thought that a hemp necktie was the easiest way out of the argument. And this

here Steele party finds himself, at the age of twenty-four, with something like

thirty minutes of life to his credit. He don’t take on none, nor make a

play for mercy, nor try any fancy speech-making. He just waits round, kinder

pale, but seemin’ indifferent, considerin’ it was his funeral that

was impendin’. I’ve heard my father say that he was a tall, slim

boy, with a kind of girlish prettiness, and the committee looked some for

hysterics and they didn’t get none. The noose was made ready and they

told Steele he could have five minutes to pray, if he wanted to, or he could

take it out in cursing, just as he chose. The boy said he felt that he

hadn’t quite all that was coming to him in the way of enjoyment, and that

while he was far from criticising the vigilance committee, he was not

altogether partial to the nature of his demise, and if it was just the same to

them, instead of praying or cursing, he’d take that five minutes for a

song.


“They was agreeable, and he up and steps on the scaffold, what they was

mighty proud of, it bein’ about the only substantial structure the town

could boast. He began to sing that thing you’ve all been listening to,

and he had a voice like water falling light and fine in a pool below. They

crowded up close about the scaffold and listened. The words he put to it were

his own story, just like those old minstrels that you read about, and at the

end of each verse came the chorus, slow and solemn as the moment after

something great has happened. There wasn’t a hangin’-face in the

crowd after he was started. At some time or other every man had heard somebody

he thought a heap of, buried to that tune, and his voice got to workin’

on their imaginations and turned their hearts to water. I don’t remember

anything but the chorus—that went like this:


“‘Who’ll weep for me, on the gallows tree,

    As I sway in the wind and swing?

Is there never a tear to be shed for me,

    As I swing by a hempen string?

Who’ll weep, who’ll keep

Watch, as I’m rocked to sleep,

    Rocked by a hempen string?’”


There was a long silence, broken only by the crackle of the logs in the

camp-fire and the night sounds of the lonely plain. The leaping flames showed a

group of thoughtful faces. Finally, Costigan broke the silence with:


“Begorra, ’tis some av thim ’ud be doin’ well to be

lukin’ to their music-lessons about here, Oi’m thinkin’,

afther th’ day’s wurruk.”


The Irishman, with his instinctive loquacity, had expressed what none of the

rest would have considered politic to hint. It was like the giving way of the

pebble that starts the avalanche. Soon they were deep in tales of lynchings.

Peter knew only too well the trend of their talk, the “XXX” men

were feeling the public pulse, as it were. Now, according to the unwritten code

of the plains, lynching was “meet, right, just, and available” for

the cattle-thief. And Peter felt himself false to his creed, false to his

employer, false to himself, in seeking to evade the question. And yet that

pitiful cabin, the white-faced woman running to the door so often that she knew

not what she did, and the little rosy boy, who had put out his arms so

trustfully! Peter broke into their grewsome yarning. “Lord, but

you’re like a lot of old women just come from a funeral!”


“Whin the carpse died hard, and th’ wake was a success.”

Costigan turned over. “Werra, werra, but we’ll be seein’

fairies the night!”


A “XXX” man turned his head with a deliberate slowness and regarded

Peter with narrowing eyes: “If the subject of cattle-thieves and their

punishment is unpleasant to the gentleman from New York, perhaps he will favor

us with something more cheerful.” It was the same man who had given the

two definitions of the “H L” brand that morning at the round-up.


“Delighted,” said Peter, affecting not to notice the significance

of the man’s remark. “Did you ever hear of the time that Tony

Neville was burned with snow?”


The “XXX” man yawned long and audibly. No one seemed especially

interested in Tony Neville’s having been burned with snow, but Peter

struck out manfully, just in time to head off a man who said that he had seen

Jim Rodney or some one who looked like him, following the trail-herd.


“Once on a time, when it paid to be a cattle-man,” began Peter,

“there was an outfit near Laramie that hailed from the United Kingdom,

every mother’s son of them. A fine, manly lot of fellows, but wedded to

calamity along of their cooks—not the revered range article,” and

Peter waved his hand towards the “W-square” cook, who was one of

the party, “but the pampered ranch article that boasts a real stove,

planted in a real kitchen, the spoiled darling that never has to light a fire

out of wet wood in the rain.


“These unhappy Britons had every species of ill luck that could befall an

outfit, in the way of cooks; they were of every nationality, age, and sex, and

they stole, drank, quarrelled, till the outfit determined to sweep the house

clear of them and do its own cooking. Every man was to have a turn at it for a

week. There was a Scotchman, who gave them something called ‘pease

bannocks,’ three times a day; followed by an Irishman, who breakfasted

them on potatoes and whiskey. There was an Englishman, who had a beef

slaughtered every time he fancied a tenderloin. There was a Welshman, who sang

as he cooked. There were as many different kinds of indigestion as there were

men in the outfit. They would beg to do night-herding, anything to get them

away from that ranch. Finally, when their little tummies got so bad that their

overcoats thickened, or wore through, or whatever happens to stomachs’

overcoats that are treated unkindly, some one’s maiden aunt sent him a

tract saying that rice was the salvation of the human race, as witness the

Chinese. Whosever turn it was to cook that week determined to try the old

lady’s prescription. Rice was procured, about a peck, I think; and the

man who was cooking, pro tem, put the entire quantity on to boil in a huge

ham-boiler, over a slow fire, as per the directions of the maiden aunt. The

rice seemed to be doing nicely, when some one came in and said that a bunch of

antelope was over on the hills and there was a good chance to get a couple.

Every man got his gun, all but the cook, and he looked at the rice, that

hadn’t done a thing over the slow fire, in a way that would melt your

heart. ‘Just my luck that it should be my week to pot-wrestle when

there’s good hunting right at one’s front door.’


“‘Oh, come on,’ some one said. ‘Didn’t

Kellett’s aunt say the rice ought to be cooked over a slow fire? Kellett,

get your aunt’s letter and read the directions for cooking that rice

again.’


“The cook didn’t need a second invitation, and they got into their

saddles, cook and all, and went for the antelope.


“Now antelope are not like stationary wash-tubs; they move about. And

when that particular outfit arrived at the spot where those antelope were last

seen, they had moved, but the boys found traces of them, and continued on their

trail. They went in the foot-hills and they searched for those antelope all

day. They caught up with old man Hall’s outfit at dinner-time and were

invited to take a bite. Coming home by way of the ‘Circle-Star’

ranch, Colonel Semmes asked them in to have a mint-julep; the colonel was a

South Carolinian, and he had just succeeded in raising some mint. They had

several—I fear more than several—drinks before leaving for home,

with never a trace of antelope nor a thought of the rice cooking over the slow

fire. The colonel remembered some hard cider that he had, and topping off on

that, they set out. The weather was pretty warm, and on their way home they

experienced some remorse over the hard cider. Now hard cider is an accumulative

drink; it piles up interest like debt or unpaid taxes. And by the time those

Englishmen had turned the little lane leading into their home corral, they saw

a sight that made their sombreros rise. As I have said before, it was hot,

being somewhere in the month of August. Gentlemen, I hardly expect you to

believe me when I say it was snowing on their house, and not on another God

blessed thing in the landscape.


“The blame thing about it was, that every man took the phenomenon to be

his own private view of snakes, or their bibulous equivalent, manifested in

another and more terrifying form. Here was the August sun pouring down on the

plain where their ranch-house was situated; everything in sight hot and dry as

a lime-kiln, grasshoppers chirping in a hot-wave prophecy, and snow covering

the house and the ground, about to what seemed a depth of four inches. Every

one of them felt sensitive about mentioning what he saw to the others. You see,

gentlemen, being unfamiliar with American drinks, and especially old

Massachusetts cider, they merely looked to keep their saddles and no questions

asked.


“But when they got a bit closer the horror increased. Flying right out of

their windows were perfect drifts of snow, banks of it, gentlemen, and the

thermometer up past a hundred. One of the men looked about him and noticed the

pallor on the faces of the rest:


“‘Do you notice anything strange, old chap? These cursed American

drinks!’


“‘Strange!’—the boy he had spoken to was about

eighteen, a nice, red-cheeked English lad out with his uncle learning the

cattle business. ‘Good God!’ the boy said. ‘I’ve always

tried to lead a good life, and here I am a paretic before I’ve come of

age.’


“They halted their horses and held a consultation. The boss came to the

conclusion that since they had all seen it, there was nothing to do but

continue the investigation and send the details to the ‘Society for

Psychical Research,’ when he got down from his horse and walked towards

the door of the house. At his approach, as if to rebuke his wanton curiosity, a

great blast of snow blew out of the window and got him full in the face. He

howled—the snow was scalding hot.


“Then they remembered the rice.”


“Is that all?” demanded the man who had wanted to talk about

rustling.


“Isn’t it enough?” said Peter, who could afford to be

magnanimous, now that he had accomplished his point.


“When I first heard that story, ’bout ten years ago, it ended with

the Britishers riding like hell over to the Wolcott ranch to borrow umbrellas

to keep off the hot rice while they got into the house,” said the man,

still sulky.


“That’s the way they tell it to tenderfeet,” and Peter turned

on his heel. The story-telling for the evening was over, the boys got their

blankets and set about making their beds for the night.


XIII.

Mary’s First Day In Camp


The first day spent as governess to the family of Yellett reminded Mary

Carmichael of those days mentioned in the opening chapter of Genesis, days

wherein whole geological ages developed and decayed. Any era, geological or

otherwise, she felt might have had its rise, decline, and fall during that

first day spent in a sheep camp.


She awoke to the sound of faint tinklings, and accepted the towering peaks of

the Wind River mountains, with their snowy mantles all shadowy in the whitening

dawn, and the warmer grays of huddling foot-hills, as one receives, without

question, the fantastic visions of sleep. The faint tinkling grew nearer,

mingled with a light pitter patter and a far off baa-ing and bleating; then, as

shadowy as the sheep in dreams, a great flock came winding round the hill; in

and out through the sage-brush they went and came, elusive as the early morning

shadows they moved among. The air was crystalline and sparkling;

creation’s first morning could not have promised more. It would have been

inconsistent in such a place to waken in a house; the desert, that seemed a

lifeless sea, the sheep moving like gray shadows, were all parts of a big, new

world that had no need of houses built by hands.


Ben, oldest of the Brobdingnag tribe, who had greeted Mary’s request to

be directed to “the house” as a bit of dry Eastern humor, led the

herd to pasture. Ben’s right-hand man was “Stump,” the

collie, so named because he had no tail worth mentioning, but otherwise in full

possession of his faculties. Stump was newly broken to his official duties and

authority sat heavily on him. Keenly alert, he flew hither and thither, first

after one straying member of the herd, then another, barking an early morning

roll-call as he went. Two other male Brobdingnags came from some sequestered

spot in the landscape and joined Ben—Mary recognized two more pupils.


Mrs. Yellett then unrolled the pillow constructed the night previous of such

garments as she had been willing to dispense with, and put them on. The

vastness of her surroundings did not prevent her from locating the minutest

article, and Mary gave her the respectful admiration of a woman who has spent a

great deal of time searching for things in an infinitely smaller space. The

matriarch then called the remaining members of her household

officially—the Misses Yellett accomplished their early morning toilets

with the simplicity of young robins. Only the new governess hung back, but

finally mustered up enough courage to say that if such a thing was possible she

would like to have a bath.


Mrs. Yellett greeted her request with the amused tolerance of one who has never

given such a trifle a thought.


“The habit of bathing,” she commented, “is shore like

religion: them that observes it wonders how them that neglects it gets

along.” She beckoned Mary to follow, and led the way to a bunch of

willows that grew about a stone’s-throw from the camp. “Here be a

whole creek full of water, if you don’t lack the fortitood. It’s

cold enough to sell for ten cents a glass down to Texas.”


Somewhat dismayed, Mary stepped gingerly into the creek. Its intense cold

numbed her at first, but a second later awoke all her young lustiness, and she

returned to camp in a fine glow of courage to encounter whatever else there

might be of novelty. Mrs. Yellett was preparing breakfast at a sheet-iron

stove, assisted by Cacta and Clematis.


“Your hankering after a bath like this”—she added another

handful of flour to the biscuit dough—“do shore remind me of an

Englishman who come to visit near Laramie in the days of plenty, when steers

had jumped to forty-five. This yere Britisher was exhibit stock, shore enough,

being what’s called a peer of the realm, which means, in his own country,

that he is just nacherally entitled from the start to h’ist his nose

high.


“The outfit he was goin’ to visit wasn’t in the habit of

havin’ peers drop in on them casual, but they aimed to make him feel that

he wasn’t the first of the herd that headed that way by a

quart”—she cut four biscuits with a tin cup, and

resumed—“to which end they rounded up every specimen of canned food

that’s ever come across the Rockies.


“‘Let him ask for “salmon esplinade,” let him ask for

“chicken marine-go,” let him ask for plum-pudding, let him ask for

hair-oil or throat lozengers, this yere outfit calls his bluff,’ says

Billy Ames, who owns the ‘twin star’ outfit and is

anticipatin’ this peer as a guest.


“Well, just as everything is ready, the can-opener, sharp as a razor,

waitin’ to open up such effete luxuries as the peer may demand, Bill Ames

gets called to California by the sickness of his wife. He feels mean about

abandonin’ the peer, but he don’t seem to have no choice, his wife

bein’ one of them women who shares her bad health pretty impartially

round the family. So Billy he departs. But before he goes he expounds to Joplin

Joe, his foreman, the nature of a peer and how his wants is apt to be a heap

fashionable, and that when he asks for anything to grasp the can-opener and run

to the store-house—Cacta, you put on the coffee!


“That peer arrives in the afternoon, and he never makes a request any

more than a corpse. Beyond a marked disposition to herd by himself and to

maintain the greatest possible distance between his own person and a

six-shooter, he don’t vary none from the bulk of tenderfeet. At night,

when all parties retires, and Joplin Joe ponders on them untouched, effete

luxuries in the store-room, and how the can-opener ’ain’t once been

dimmed in the cause of hospitality, it frets him considerable, and he feels he

ain’t doin’ his duty to the absent Billy Ames.


“At sunrise he can stand it no longer. He thunders on the

Britisher’s door with the butt of his six-shooter, calling out:


“‘Peer, peer, be you awake?’


“The peer allowed he was, though his teeth was rattling like broken

crockery.


“‘Peer, would you relish some “salmon

esplinade”?’


“The peer allowed he wouldn’t.


“‘Peer, would you relish some “chicken

marine-go”?’


“The peer allowed he shore wouldn’t, and the crockery rattled

harder than ever. Joplin Joe then tried him on the hair-oil and the throat

lozengers, the peer declining each with thanks.


“‘Peer,’ said Joplin Joe, fair busting with hospitality,

‘is there anything in this Gawd’s world that you do want?’


“The crockery rattled an interlood, then Joplin Joe made out:


“‘Thanks, very much. I should like a ba-ath’—Clematis,

you see if them biscuits is brownin’.


“Joe he ran to the store-room, and his eye encountered a barrel of

corned-beef. He calls to a couple of cow-punchers, and the first thing you know

that late corned steer is piled onto the prairie and them cow-punchers is

hustling the empty barrel in to the peer. Next they detaches the steps from the

kitchen door, ropes ’em to the barrel and introduces the peer to his

bath. He’s good people all right, and when he sees they calls his bluff

he steps in all right and lets ’em soak him a couple of buckets. This

here move restores all parties to a mutual understanding, and the peer he

bathes in the corned-beef barrel regular durin’ his stay—you see

the habit had cinched him.”


Ned had shot an antelope a day or two previous, and antelope steak, broiled

over a glowing bed of wood coals, with black coffee, stewed dried apples, and

soda biscuit made up what Mary found to be an unexpectedly palatable breakfast.

As camp did not include a cow, no milk or butter was served with meals.

Nevertheless, the hungry tenderfoot was quite content, and missed none of the

appurtenances she had been brought up to believe essential to a civilized meal,

not even the little silver jug that Aunt Martha always insisted came over with

William the Conqueror—Aunt Martha scorned the May-flower contingent as

parvenus.


The family sat on the grass, tailor fashion, and every one helped himself to

what appetite prompted, in a fashion that suggested brilliant gymnastic powers.

To pass a dish to any one, the governess discovered, was construed as an

evidence of mental weakness and eccentricity. The family satisfied its appetite

without assistance or amenities, but with the skill of a troupe of jugglers.


Breakfast was half over when Mrs. Yellett laid down her knife, which she had

handled throughout the meal with masterly efficiency. Mary watched her in

hopeless embarrassment, and wondered if her own timid use of a tin fork could

be construed as an unfriendly comment upon the Yelletts’ more simple and

direct code of table etiquette.


“Land’s sakes! I just felt, all the time we’ve been eating,

we was forgettin’ something. You children ought to remember, I got so

much on my mind.”


All eyes turned anxiously to the cooking-stove, while an expression of frank

regret began to settle over the different faces. The backbone of their

appetites had been broken, and there was something else, perhaps something even

more appetizing, to come.


Interpreting the trend of their glance and expression, up flared Mrs. Yellett,

with as great a show of indignation as if some one had set a match to her

petticoats.


“I declare, I never see such children; no more nacheral feelin’s

than a herd of coyotes; never thinks of a plumb thing but grub. No, make no

mistake about the character of the objec’ we’ve forgot.

’Tain’t sweet pertaters, ’tain’t molasses,

’tain’t corn-bread—it’s paw! It’s your pore old

paw—him settin’ in the tent, forsook and neglected by his own

children.”


All started up to remedy their filial neglect without loss of time, but Mrs.

Yellett waved them back to their places.


“Don’t the whole posse of you go after him, like he’d done

something and was to be apprehended. Ben, you go after your father.”


Ben strode over to the little white tent that Mary had noticed glimmering in

the moonlight the preceding evening, and presently emerged, supporting on his

arm a partially paralyzed old man, who might have been Rip Van Winkle in the

worst of tempers. His white hair and beard encircled a shrivelled, hawklike

face, the mouth was sucked back in a toothless eddy that brought tip of nose

and tip of chin into whispering distance, the eyes glittered from behind the

overhanging, ragged brows like those of a hungry animal searching through the

brush for its prey.


“If you’ve done eatin’,” whispered Mrs. Yellett to Miss

Carmichael, “you’d better run on. Paw’s langwidge is simply

awful when we forget to bring him to meals.” Mary ran on.


When, after the lapse of some thirty minutes or so, the stentorian voice of

Mrs. Yellett recalled Mary to camp, she found that the tin breakfast service

had been washed and returned to the mess-box, the beds had been neatly folded

and piled in one of the wagons—in fact, the extremely simple tent-hold,

to coin a word, was in absolute order. It was just 6 A.M., and Mrs. Yellett

thought it high time to begin school. Mary tried to convey to her that the hour

was somewhat unusual, but she seemed to think that for pupils who were

beginning their tasks comparatively late in life it would be impossible to

start sufficiently early in the morning. So at this young and tender hour, with

many misgivings, Mary set about preparing her al fresco class-room.


She chose a nice, flat little piece of the United States, situated in the shade

of the clump of willows that bordered a trickling creek not far from her sylvan

bath-room of the early morning. How she was to sit on the ground all day and

yet preserve a properly pedagogical demeanor was the first question to be

settled. That there was nothing even remotely resembling a chair in camp she

felt reasonably assured, as “paw” was sitting on an inverted

soap-box under a pine-tree, and “paw,” by reason of age and

infirmity, appropriated all luxuries. Mrs. Yellett, with her usual acumen,

grasped the situation.


“I’m figgerin’,” she commented, “that there must

be easier ways of governin’ than sittin’ up like a prairie-dog

while you’re at it.”


Mrs. Yellett took a hurried survey of the camp, lessening the distance between

herself and one of the light wagons with a gait in which grace was entirely

subservient to speed; then, with one capacious wrench of the arms, she loosened

the spring seat from the wagon and bore it to the governess with an artless air

of triumph. It was difficult, under these circumstances, to explain to Mrs.

Yellett that without that symbol of scholastic authority, a desk, the wagon

seat was useless. Nevertheless, Mary set forth, with all her eloquence, the

mission of a desk. Mrs. Yellett was genuinely depressed. Had she imported the

magician without his wand—Aladdin without his lamp? She proposed a

bewildering choice—an inverted wash-tub, two buckets sustaining the

relation of caryatides to a board, the sheet-iron cooking-stove. In an excess

of solicitude she even suggested robbing “paw” of his soap-box.


Mary chose the wash-tub on condition that Mrs. Yellett consented to sacrifice

the handles in the cause of lower education. She felt that an inverted tub that

was likely to see-saw during class hours would tend rather to develop a sense

of humor in her pupils than to contribute to her pedagogical dignity.


The camp, as may already have been inferred, enjoyed a matriarchal form of

government. Its feminine dictator was no exception to the race of autocrats in

that she was not an absolute stranger to the rosy byways of self-indulgence.

There was a strenuous quality in her pleasuring perhaps not inconsistent in one

whose daily tasks included sheep-herding, ditch-digging, varied by irrigating

and shearing in their proper seasons. Under the circumstances, it was not

surprising that her wash-tub bore about the same relationship to her real

duties as does the crochet needle or embroidery hoop to the lives of less

arduously engaged women. It was at once her fad and her relaxation, the dainty

feminine accomplishment with which she whiled away the hours after a busy day

spent with pick and shovel. Of all this Mary was ignorant when she proposed

that Mrs. Yellett saw off the tub-handles in the cause of culture. However,

Mrs. Yellett procured a saw, yet the hand that held it lingered in its descent

on the handles. She contemplated the tub as affectionately as Hamlet regarding

the skull of “Alas, poor Yorick!”


“This,” she observed, “is the only thing about camp that

reminds me I’m a woman. I’d plumb forget it many a time if it

warn’t for this little tub. The identity of a woman is mighty apt to get

mislaid when dooty compels her to assoome the pants cast aside by the nacheral

head of the house in sickness or death. It’s ben six years now since

paw’s done a thing but set ’round and wait for meals.” Mrs.

Yellett sighed laboriously. “Not that I’m holdin’ it agin him

none. When a man sees eighty, it’s time he bedded himself down

comfortable and waited for the nacheral course of events to weed him out. But

when the boys get old enough to tend to herdin’, irrigatin’, and

the work that God A’mighty provided that man might get the chance to

sweat hisself for bread, accordin’ to the Scriptures, I aim to indulge

myself by doin’ a wash of clothes every day, even if I have to take clean

clothes and do ’em over again.”


The poor “gov’ment’s” tender heart could not resist

this presentation of the case.


“We won’t touch the handles, Mrs. Yellett,” she laughed.

“I’m glad you told me you had a personal sentiment for the tub.

There are some things I should feel the same way about—my hoe and rake,

for instance, that I care for my garden with, at home. And that suggests to me,

why not dig two little trenches for the handles and plant the tub? Then I shall

have an even firmer foundation on which to arrange the—the—the

educational miscellany.”


The suggestion of this harmless expedient was gratefully received, and the

“desk” duly implanted, whereupon Mary pathetically sought to

embellish her “class-room” from such scanty materials as happened

to be at hand. A hemstitched bureau scarf that she had tucked in her trunk, in

unquestioning faith in the bureau that was to be part of the ranch equipment,

took the “raw edge,” as it were, off the desk. A bunch of prairie

flowers, flaming cactus blossoms in scarlet and yellow, ox-eyed daisies, white

clematis from the creek, seemed none the less decorative for the tin cup that

held them. Mary grimly told herself that her school was to have refining

influences, even if it had no furniture.


The books, pencils, and paper arranged in decorous little piles, Miss

Carmichael announced to her patroness that school was ready to open. Mrs.

Yellett, who had never heard that “a soft voice is an excellent thing in

woman,” and whose chest-notes were not unlike those of a Durham in

sustained volume of sound, made the valley of the Wind River echo with the

summons of the pupils to school, upon which the teacher herself was overcome by

the absurdity of the situation and had barely time to escape back of the

willows, where she laughed till she cried.


As the pupils trooped obediently to school, Mary noted that they carried no

flowers to their dear teacher, but that Ben, the oldest pupil, twenty-one years

old, six feet four inches in height and deeply saturnine in manner, carried a

six-shooter in his cartridge-belt. The teacher felt that she was the last to

deny a pupil any reasonable palliative of the tedium of class-hours—the

nearness of her own school-days inclined her to leniency in this

particular—but she was hardly prepared to condone a six-shooter, and

confided her fears to Mrs. Yellett, who received them with the indulgent

tolerance a strong-minded woman might extend to the feminine flutter aroused by

a mouse. She explained that Ben did not shoot for “glory,” but to

defend the herd from the casual calls of mountain-lions, bears, and coyotes.

Jack and Ned, who were very nearly as tall as their older brother, carried

similar weapons. Mary prayed that a fraternal spirit might dwell among her

pupils.


The Misses Yellett were hardly less terrifying than their brothers. They had

their father’s fierce, hawklike profile, softened by youth, and the

appalling height and robustness due to the freedom and fresh air of a nomadic

existence. Their costumes might, Mary thought, have been fashioned out of

gunny-sacks by the simple expedient of cutting holes for the head and arms. The

description of the dress worn by the charcoal-burner’s daughter in any

mediaeval novel of modern construction would approximate fairly well the school

toilets of these young lady pupils. The boys wore overalls and flannel shirts,

which, in contrast to the sketchy effects of their sisters’ costumes,

seemed almost modish. Mrs. Yellett then left the “class-room,”

saying she must take Ben’s place with the sheep.


The Brobdingnags, huge of stature, sinister of aspect, deeply distrustful of

the rites in which they were about to participate, closed in about their

teacher. From the pigeon-holes of memory Mary drew forth the academic smile

with which a certain teacher of hers had invariably opened school. The pupils

greeted the academic smile with obvious suspicion. No one smiled in camp. When

anything according with their conception of the humorous happened, they laughed

uproariously. Thus, early in the morning, on his way to breakfast, Ned had

stumbled over an ax and severely cut his head. Every one but Ned saw the point

of this joke immediately, and hearty guffaws testified to their appreciation.


Miss Carmichael took her place behind the upturned tub.


“Will you please be seated?” she said.


The class complied with the instantaneous precision of automata newly greased

and in excellent working order. Their abrupt obedience was disconcerting. Some

one must have been drilling them, thought their anxious teacher, in the art of

simultaneous squatting. The temper of the class respecting scholastic

deportment leaned towards rigidity bordering on self-torture.


Mary made out a roll-call, and by unanimous consent it was agreed to arrange

the class as it then stood, or rather squatted, with the Herculean Ben at the

top, and gradually diminishing in size till it reached the vanishing point with

Cacta, who was ten and the least terrifying of all.


“And now,” ventured the teacher, with the courage of a white

rabbit, “what have you been in the habit of studying?”


Absolute silence on the part of the class, which confronted its questioner

straight as a row of bottles, presenting faces imperturbable as so many

sphinxes.


Other questions met with an equally disheartening response. Miss Carmichael sat

up straight, pushed back the persistent curls from her face, and bent every

energy towards the achievement of a “firm” demeanor.


“Clematis,” said she, wisely selecting perhaps the least formidable

of the class, “I want you to give me some idea of the kind of work you

have been doing, so that we may all be able to understand each other. Now, in

your mathematics, for instance, which of you have finished with your

arithmetic, and which—”


“What do you mean?” begged Clematis, somewhat tearful.


“Where are you in your arithmetic?


“Nowhere, ma’am.”


“Do you mean you have never learned any?” Mary Carmichael shuddered

as she icily put the question.


“Yes, ma’am.”


“Is that the case with all of you?”


Emphatic nods left no room for doubt.


“Then we’ll leave that for the present. If you will tell me,

Clematis, what kind of work you have been doing in your history and English, we

will get to work on those to-day. What books have you been using?”


Not unnaturally, Clematis, who was emotional and easily impressed, began to

feel as though she were a criminal. She sobbed in a helpless, feminine way. Ben

spoke up, fearsomely, from the top of the class.


“We ’ain’t got no books,” said he, in grim rebuke, as

though to put an end to a profitless discussion.


“Do you wish me to understand,” quavered Mary, “that you have

had no studies—that you—can’t read?—that

you—don’t know—anything?”


“That’s it,” said Ben, with the nearest approach to

cheerfulness he had yet manifested.


Meanwhile there lay on the teacher’s “desk” copies of

Clodd’s Childhood of the World, two of that excellent series of History

Primers, and The Young Geologist, all carefully selected, in the fulness of

Mary’s ignorance, for the little pupils of her imagination. She had

brought no primer, as Mrs. Yellett’s letter had distinctly said that the

youngest child was ten and that all were comparatively advanced in their

studies. More than ever Mary longed to penetrate the mystery of that Irish

linen decoy, for without doubt it was to be her melancholy fate to conduct this

giant band through the alphabet!


Accordingly she wrote out the letters of the alphabet with large simplicity and

a sublime renunciation of flourish. The class received it tepidly. Mary grew

eloquent over its unswerving verities. The class remained lukewarm. The

difference between a and b was a matter of indifference to the house of

Yellett. They regarded their teacher’s strenuous efforts to furnish a key

to the acquirement of the alphabet with the amused superiority of

“grown-ups” watching infant antics with pencil and paper. Meanwhile

her fear of the class increased in proportion as her ability to hold its

attention diminished. The backbone of the school was plainly wilting. The

little scholars, armed to the teeth, no longer sat up straight as tenpins.

After twenty-five minutes of educational experience, satiety bowled them over.


A single glance had convinced Ben that the alphabet was beneath contempt. He

yawned automatically at regular intervals—long, dismal yawns that

threatened to terminate in a howl, the unchecked, primitive type of yawn that

one hears in the cages of the zoological gardens on a dull day. Miss Carmichael

raised interrogatory eyebrows, but she might as well have looked reproof at a

Bengal tiger.


The class was rapidly promoted to c-a-t, cat; but these dizzy intellectual

heights left them cold and dull. Ben began to clean his revolver, and on being

asked why he did not pay attention to his lessons, answered, briefly:


“It’s all d——d foolishness.”


Cacta and Clem were pulling each other’s hair. Mary affected not to see

this sisterly exchange of torture. Ned whittled a stick; and, in chorus, when

their teacher told them that d-o-g spelled dog, they shouted derision, and

affirmed that they had no difficulty in compelling the obedience of Stump even

without this particular bit of erudition. Though Mary had always abhorred

corporal punishment, she began to see arguments in its favor.


With the handleless tub as an elbow-rest the teacher took counsel with herself.

Strategy must be employed with the intellectual conquest of the Brobdingnags.

Summoning all the pedagogical dignity of which she was capable, she asked:


“Boys, don’t you want to know how to read?”


“Noap,” responded the head of the class.


“Don’t you want to know how to write?”


“Noap.”


“But, my dear boy, what would you do if you left here and went out into

the world, where every one knows these things and your ignorance would be

evident at every turn. What would you do?”


“Slug the whole blamed outfit!”


Mary looked at her watch. School had lasted just forty-five minutes. Had time

become petrified?


XIV.

Judith Adjusts The Situation


Mary had been a member of the Yellett household for something over a week, and

the intellectual conquest of her Brobdingnag pupils seemed as hopeless as on

that first day. School seemed to be regarded by them as a sort of neutral

territory, admirably adapted for the settlement of long-standing grudges, the

pleasant exchange of practical jokes, peace and war conferences; also as a mart

of trade, where fire-arms, knives, bear and elk teeth might be swapped with a

greater expenditure of time and conversation than under the maternal eye.

“Teacher,” as she was understood and accepted by the house of

Yellett, undoubtedly filled a long-felt want. Presiding over a school of

six-imp power for a week, however, had humbled Mary to the point of seriously

considering a letter to the home government, meekly asking for return

transportation. But this was before feminine wile had struggled with feminine

vanity, and feminine wile won the day. School still continued to open at six,

from which early and unusual hour it continued, without recess or interruption,

till noon, when dinner pleasantly invaded the scholastic monotony, to the

infinite relief of all parties concerned.


Mary had dismissed her pupils a few minutes before the usual hour, on a

particularly bad day, that she might rally her scattered faculties and present

something of a countenance to the watchful eye of Mrs. Yellett. Every element

of humor had vanished from the situation. The inverted tub was no longer a

theme for merriment in her diary; home-life without a house was no longer a

diverting epigram; she had closed her eyes that she might not see the mountains

in all their grandeur. In her present mood of abject homesickness the

white-capped peaks were part and parcel of the affront. With head sunk in the

palms of her hands, and elbows resting on the inverted tub, Mary presented a

picture of woe, in which the wicked element of comedy was not wholly lacking.

Looking up suddenly, she saw Judith Rodney advancing. The first glimpse of her

put Mary in a more rational mood.


“I’m so glad to see you! Behold my class-room appointments! They

may seem a trifle novel, but, for that matter, so are my pupils,” began

Mary, determining to present the same front to Judith that she had to Mrs.

Yellett. But Judith was not to be put off. She looked into Mary’s eyes

and did not relax her gaze until she was rewarded with an answering twinkle.

Then Mary laughed long and merrily, the first good, hearty laugh since the

beginning of her teaching.


“Tell me,” Mary broke out, suddenly, “or the suspense will

kill me, who wrote that lovely letter—on such good quality Irish linen,

too? Snob that I was, it was the letter that did it.”


“So you have your suspicions that it was not a home product?”


“You didn’t do it, did you?”


“Oh no; though I was asked, and so was Miss Wetmore, I believe. Of course

poor Mrs. Yellett had no other recourse, as I suppose you know. I chose to be

disobliging that time, and was sorry for it afterwards—sorry when I heard

about the letter that really went! Do you find the sheep-wagon so very

dreadful?”


“I thought,” laughed Mary, “that it was going to be like a

picture I saw in a magazine, Mexican hammocks, grass cushions, and a lady

pouring tea from a samovar; instead it was the sheep-wagon and ‘Do you

sleep light or dark?’ There is Mrs. Yellett calling us to dinner. Shall I

have a chance to talk to you alone afterwards?”


“I’ve come all the way from Dax’s to see you,”

explained Judith, with characteristic directness. “We have all the

afternoon.”


“Really!” Mary displayed a flash of school-girl enthusiasm.

“I feel as if I could almost bear the scenery.”


Presumably Judith was a favorite guest of the Yellett household, and not

without reason. She took her place in the circle about the homely, steaming

fare, with an ease and grace that suggested that dining off the ground was an

every-day affair with her, and chairs and tables undreamed-of luxuries. Mary

envied her ready tact. Why could she not meet these people with Judith’s

poise—bring out the best of them, as she did? The boys talked readily and

naturally—there was even a flavor to what they said. As for herself, try

never so conscientiously and she would be confronted by frank amusement or shy

distrust. Even “paw” beamed at Judith appreciatively as he consumed

his meal with infinite, toothless labor. The Spartan family became almost

sprightly under the pleasantly stimulating influence of its guest.


“What kind of basques are they wearing this summer, Judy?” inquired

Mrs. Yellett, regarding her guest’s trim shirt-waist judicially. “I

reckon them loose, meal-sack things must be all the go since you and Miss Mary

both have ’em; but give me a good, tight-fittin’ basque, every

time. How’s any one to know whether you got a figure or not, in a thing

that never hits you anywhere?” questioned the matriarch, not without a

touch of pride anent her own fine proportions.


“You really ought to have a shirt-waist, Mrs. Yellett. You’ve no

idea of the comfort of them, till you’ve worn them.”


“I don’t see but I’ll have to come to it.” Her tone was

frankly regretful, as one who feels obliged to follow the behests of fashion,

yet, in so doing, sacrifices a cherished ideal. Mary Carmichael choked over her

coffee in an abortive attempt to restrain her audible hilarity. Judith, without

a trace of amusement, was discussing materials, cut, and buttons; the

plainswoman had proved herself the better gentlewoman of the two.


“Get me a spotty calico, white, with a red dot, will you, the next time

you’re over to Ervay? Buttons accordin’ to your judgment; but if

you could get some white chiny with a red ring, I think they’d match it

handsome.” She frowned reflectively. “You’re sure one of them

loose, hangy things ’d become me? Then you can bring it over Tuesday,

when you come to the hunt.”


“What hunt?” asked Judith, in all simplicity.


“Why, the wolf-hunt. Peter Hamilton come here three days ago and made

arrangements for ’em all to have supper here after it was done.

’Lowed there was a young Eastern lady in the party, Miss Colebrooke, who

couldn’t wait to meet me. Course you’re goin’, Judy?

You’ve plumb forgot it, or somethin’ happened to the messenger. Who

ever hyeard tell of anythin’ happenin’ in this yere county

’thout you bein’ the very axle of it?”


Judith had not betrayed her chagrin by the least change of countenance. To the

most searching glance every faculty was intent on the shirt-waist with the

ringed buttons. Yet both women felt—by a species of telepathy wholly

feminine—that Judith was deeply wounded. Loyal Sarah Yellett decided that

Hamilton’s guests would get but a scant supper from her if her friend

Judith was to be unfavored with an invitation, while Judith, in her own warm

heart, resented as deeply as Peter’s slight of herself, his tale of Miss

Colebrooke’s impatience to meet Mrs. Yellett. The matriarch’s

dominant personality evoked many a smile even from those most deeply conscious

of her worth; but it wasn’t like Peter to make a spectacle of his

ruggedly honest neighbor. Nevertheless she remarked, coolly:


“I sha’n’t be able to bring your shirt-waist things up

Tuesday, I’m afraid, Mrs. Yellett, but I’ll try to bring them

towards the end of the week.” Then, with a swift change of subject,

“How are the boys getting on with their education, Miss

Carmichael?”


The boys looked at Mary out of the corners of their eyes. Their prowess in the

field of letters had not been publicly discussed before. Mary Carmichael,

emboldened by Judith’s presence, looked at her tormentors with a

judicious glance.


“The girls are doing fairly well,” she replied, suppressing the

mischief in her eyes, “but the boys, poor fellows, I think something must

be the matter with them. Did they ever fall on their heads when they were

babies, Mrs. Yellett?”


“Not more than common. All babies fall on their heads; it’s as

common as colic.”


“Poor boys!” said Mary, with a manner that suggested they were

miles away, rather than within a few feet of her. “Poor boys! I’ve

never seen anything like it. They try so hard, too, yet they can make nothing

of work that would be play for a child of three. They must have fallen on their

heads harder than you supposed, Mrs. Yellett.”


“Perhaps their skulls were a heap frailer than I allowed for at the

time,” said Mrs. Yellett, with similar remoteness, yet with a twinkle

that showed Mary she understood the situation.


“An infant’s skull doesn’t stand much knocking about, I

suppose, Mrs. Yellett?”


“Not a great deal, if there ain’t plenty of vinegar and brown paper

handy, and I seldom had such fancy fixings in camp. It’s too bad my boys

should be dumb ’n account of a little thing like vinegar and brown

paper.”


“Maw, they be dumb as Injuns,” declared Cacta, preening herself,

while the Messrs. Yellett reapplied themselves to their dinner with

ostentatious interest.


“Well, well!” said Mrs. Yellett; “it be a hard blow to me to

know that my sons are lackings; there’s mothers I know as would give vent

to their disapp’inted ambition in ways I’d consider crool to the

absent-minded. Now hearken, the whole outfit of you! Any offspring of mine now

present and forever after holding his peace, who proves feebleminded by the end

of the coming week, takes over all the work, labor, and chores of such

offspring as demonstrates himself in full possession of his faculties, the

matter to be reported on by the gov’ment.”


No sovereign, issuing a proclamation of war, could have assumed a more

formidable mien than Mrs. Yellett, squatting erect on the prairie, crowned by

her rabbit-skin cap. Mary and Judith, with bland, impassive expressions, noted

the effect of the mandate. There was not the faintest symptom of rebellion;

each Brobdingnag accepted the matriarch’s edict without a murmur.


With an air of further meditation on the efficacy of brown paper and vinegar at

the crucial moment, Mrs. Yellett suddenly observed:


“The lacking, like the dog, may be taught to fetch and carry a book; but

to learn it he is unable.”


“Maw, does it say that in the Book of Hiram?” asked Clematis.


“It says that, an’ more, too. It says, ‘The words of the wise

are an expense, but the lovin’ parent don’t grudge

’em.’”


Mary Carmichael had noticed, as her alien presence came to be less of a check

on Mrs. Yellett’s natural medium of expression, that she was much

addicted to a species of quotation with which she impartially adorned her

conversation, pointed family morals, or administered an occasional reproof.

These family aphorisms were sometimes semi-legal, sometimes semi-scriptural in

turn of phrase, and built on a foundation of homely philosophy. They were

ascribed to the “Book of Hiram” and never failed of salutary effect

in the family circle. But the apt quotations that she had just heard piqued

Mary’s curiosity more than before.


“Do you happen to have a copy of the Book of Hiram, Mrs. Yellett?”

she asked, in all innocence, supposing that the ‘homely apothegms were to

be found at the back of some patent-medicine almanac. Judith Rodney listened in

wonder. The question had never before been asked in her hearing.


“I lost mine.” Mrs. Yellett folded her arms and looked at her

questioner with something of a challenging mien.


“What a pity! I’ve been so interested in the quotations I’ve

heard you make from it.”


“What’s the matter with ’em?” she demanded, pride and

apprehension equally commingled.


Judith Rodney rushed to the rescue:


“Nothing is the matter with them, Mrs. Yellett,” she said, with her

disarming smile, “except that there is not quite enough to go

around.”


The matriarch had the air of gathering herself together for something really

worth while. Then she tossed off:


“‘’Tain’t always the quality of the grub that confers

the flavor, but sometimes the scarcity thereof.’”


Perhaps it has been the good-fortune of some of us to say a word of praise to

an author, while unconscious of his relationship to the book praised. Mark the

genial glow radiating from every feature of our auditor! How we feel ourselves

anointed with his approval, our good taste and critical faculty how commended!

It is a luxury that goes a long way towards mitigating the discomfitures caused

by the reverse of this unctuous blunder.


“The Book of Hiram,” said Mrs. Yellett, angling for time, “is

a book—it do surprise me that it escapes your notice back East. You ever

heard tell of the Book of Mormon?”


Mary assented.


“Well, the Book of Hiram is like the Book of Mormon, only a heap more

undefiled. The youngest child can read it without asking a single embarrassing

question of its elder, and the oldest sinner can read it without having any

fleshly meditations intrudin’ on his piety.”


The Yellett family had by this time dispersed itself for the afternoon, and the

matriarch and the two girls started in to clear away the meal and wash the

dishes.


“That’s the kind of book for me,” continued Mrs. Yellett,

vigorously swishing about in the soapy water. “Story-books don’t

count none with me these days. It’s my opinion that things are snarled up

a whole lot too much in real life without pestering over the anguish of print

folks. Flesh and blood suffering goes without a groan of sympathy from the

on-lookers, while novel characters wade to the neck in compassion. I’ve

pondered on that a whole lot, seem’ a heap of indifference to every-day

calamity, and the way I assay it is like this: print folks has terrible

fanciful layouts given to their griefs and worriments by the authors of their

being. The trimmings to their troubles is mighty attractive. Don’t you

reckon I’d be willin’ to have a spell of trouble if I had a

sweeping black velvet dress to do it in? Yes, indeed, I’d be

willin’ to turn a few of them shades of anguish, ‘gray’s

ashes,’ ‘pale as death,’ and so on, if they’d give me

the dress novel ladies seems to have for them special occasions.”


“But you used to like novels, you know you did, Mrs. Yellett,”

observed Judith Rodney.


“Yes, I didn’t always entertain these views concernin’

romance. You wouldn’t believe it, but there was a time when I just

nacherally went careerin’ round enveloped in fantasies. I was young

then—just about the time I married paw. Every novel that was read to me,

I mean that I read”—Mrs. Yellett blushed a deep copper color

through her many coats of tan—“convinced me that I was the heroine

thereof. And, nacherally, I turned over to paw the feachers and characteristics

of the hero in said book I happened to be enjoyin’ at the time. Paw never

knew it, but sometimes he was a dook, and it was plumb hard work. Just about as

hard as ropin’ a mountain-lion an’ sayin’, ‘remember,

you are a sheep from this time henceforth, and trim your action

accordin’.’ I’d say to paw, ‘Let’s walk together

in the gloaming, here in this deserted garden’; and paw would say,

‘Name o’ Gawd, woman, have you lost your mind? It’s plumb

three hundred and fifty miles to the Tivoli beer-garden in Cheyenne, and it

ain’t deserted, either!’


“Then I’d wring my hands in anguish, same as the Lady Mary,

an’ paw would declare I was locoed. He seemed a heap more nacheral when I

pretended he was ‘Black Ranger, the Pirate King.’ His language came

in handy, and his cartridge-belt and pistol all came in Black Ranger’s

outfit. Yes, it was a heap easier playing he was a pirate than a dook. All this

happened back to Salt Lake, where me an’ paw was married.”


Mrs. Yellett looked towards the mountain-range that separated her from the

Mormon country, and her listeners realized that she was verging perilously

close to confidences. Mary Carmichael, who dreaded missing any detail of the

chronicle that dealt with paw in the rôle of apocryphal duke, hastened to say:


“And you lost your taste for romance, finally?”


“In Salt Lake I was left to myself a whole lot-there was reasons why I

didn’t mingle with the Mormon herd. Paw was mighty attentive to me, but

them was troublous times for paw. I pastures myself with the fleetin’

figures of romance the endoorin’ time and enjoys myself a heap. When paw

wasn’t a dook or a pirate king, unbeknownst to himself, like as not he

was Sir Marmaduke Trevelyun, or somebody entitled to the same amount of dog.


“’Bout this time a little stranger was due in our midst, and the

woman who came to take care of me was plumb locoed over novels, same as me,

only worse. She just hungered for ’em, same as if she had a longin’

for something out of season. She brought a batch of them with her in her trunk,

we borrowed her a lot more, some I don’t know how she come by. But they

didn’t have no effect; it was like feedin’ an’

Injun—you couldn’t strike bottom. She read out of ’em to me

with disastrous results happenin’, an’ that cured me. The brand on

this here book that effected my change of heart was The Bride of the Tomb. I

forget the name of the girl in that romance, but she was in hard luck from the

start. She couldn’t head off the man pursooin’ her, any way she

turned. She’d wheel out of his way cl’ar across country, but

he’d land thar fust an’ wait for her, a smile on his satanine

feachers.


“I got so wrought up along o’ that book, an’ worried as to

the outcome, ’most as bad as the girl. Think of it! An’ me with

only three baby-shirts an’ a flannel petticoat made at the time! Seemed

’s if I couldn’t hustle my meals fast enough, I just hankered so to

know what was goin’ to happen next! I plumb detested the man with the

handsome feachers, same as the girl. Me an’ her felt precisely alike

about him. And when he shut her up in the family vault I just giv’ up

an’ was took then an’ there, an’ me without so much as

finishin’ the flannel petticoat! I never could endure the sight of a

novel since. Perhaps that’s why Ben is so dumb about his books—just

holds a nacheral grudge against ’em along of my havin’ to borrow

slips for him.”


“Has the Book of Hiram anything to say against the habit of novel

reading, Mrs. Yellett?” inquired Judith, demurely.


She paused for a moment. “It’s mighty inconvenient that I should

have mislaid that book, but rounding up my recollections of it, I recall

something like this: ‘Romance is the loco-weed of humanity.’”


“So you don’t approve of the Mormon Bible?” ventured Mary.


“I jest nacherally execrates Mormonism, spoken, printed, or in

action,” she said, with an emphasis that suggested the subject had a

strong personal bearing. “I recall a text from the Book of Hiram touching

on Mormon deportment in particklar an’ human nature at large. It says,

‘Where several women and one man are gathered together for the purpose of

serving the Lord, the man gets the bulk of the service.”


She broke off suddenly, as if she feared she had said too much.

“Judy,” she demanded, “is Mis’ Dax busy with Leander

now?”


“Not more than usual,” smiled Judith.


“Jest tell her for me, will you, that I want to hire her husband to do

some herdin’; Leander’s handy, ’n’ can work good

an’ sharp, if he is an infidel. An’ I like to have him over now

an’ then, as you know, Judy. As the Book of Hiram says, ‘It’s

neighborly to ease the check-rein of a gentled husband.’ But you tell him

I don’t want to hear any of his ever-lastin’ fool argufyin’

’bout religion. Leander ’d stop in the middle of shearin’ a

sheep to argue that Jonah never came out o’ the whale’s belly. I

ain’t no use for infidels, ’less they’re muzzled, which

Leander mos’ generally is.”


With the feeling that there was an excellent though unspoken understanding

between them, the two girls walked together to the top of the path that

wandered away from camp towards a bluff overlooking wave after wave of

foot-hills, lying blue and still like a petrified sea.


“I’m still dying to know who wrote that letter,” begged Mary.


“It was written by a lady who is very anxious to return to Washington,

and she took that means of getting one more vote. Her husband is going to run

for the Senate next term. We hear a good deal of that side of politics, you

know.”


“It was certainly convincing,” remarked the victim of the letter.

“My aunts detected many virtues in the handwriting.”


“But now that you are really here, isn’t it splendid? Mountains are

such good neighbors. They give you their great company and yet leave you your

own little reservations.”


“But I fear I can never feel at home out-of-doors,” Mary announced,

with such a rueful expression that they both smiled.


“Perhaps, then, it depends on the frame of mind. I’ve had longer

than you to cultivate it.”


Mary looked towards the mountains, serene in their strength. “Awesome as

they are,” she laughed, “they don’t frighten me nearly as

much as Ben and Ned. They are really very difficile, my pupils, and I feel so

ridiculous sitting up back of that tub, teaching them letters and the spelling

of foolish words, when they know things I’ve never dreamed of. The other

day, out of a few scratches in the dust that I should never have given a second

glance, one of them made out that some one’s horses had broken the corral

and one was trailing a rope. Whereupon my pupil got on a horse, went in search

of the strays, and returned them to men going to a round-up. After that, the

spelling of cat didn’t seem quite so much of an achievement as it had

before.”


“But they need the spelling of cat so much more than you need to

understand trail-marks. Why don’t you try a little strategy with them?

Perhaps a bribe, even? It seems to me I remember something in history about the

part played in colonization by the bright-colored bead.”


Sundry wood-cuts from a long-forgotten primer history of the United States came

back to Mary. In that tear-stained, dog-eared volume, all explorers, from

Columbus down to Lewis and Clarke, were unfailingly depicted in the attitude of

salesmen displaying squares of cloth to savages apparently in urgent need of

them.


“How stupid of me not to remember Father Marquette concluding

negotiations with a necklace!”


“Frankly plagiarize the terms of your treaty from Père Marquette, and

there you are!”


“You are so splendid!” said Mary, impulsively, remembering

Judith’s own sorrows and the smiling fortitude with which she kept them

hidden. “You make me feel like a horrid little girl that has been

whining.”


Judith looked towards the mountains a long time without speaking.


“When you know them well, they whisper great things that little folk

can’t take away.”


She turned back towards camp, walking lightly, with head thrown back. Mary

watched her. Yes, the mountains might have admitted her to their company.

The Wolf-hunt


Judith awakened with all the starry infinitude of sky for a canopy. In the

distance loomed the foot-hills, watchful sentinels of her slumbers; and,

sloping gently away from them, rolled the plain, like some smooth, dark sea

flowing deep and silently. Judith, a solitary figure adrift in that still ocean

of space, sat up and watched the stars fade and saw the young day peer

timorously at the world that lay before it. Her mind, refreshed by long hours

of dreamless sleep, turned to the problem of impending things, serenely

contemplative. The passing of many mornings and many peoples had the mountains

seen as the wreathed mists came and went about their brows, and to all who knew

the value of the gift they gave their great company, and to such as could hear,

they told their great secrets. Judith’s prayer was an outflowing of soul

to the great forces about her, a wish to be in harmony with them, to remember

her kinship, to keep some measure of their serenity in the press of burdens.

The way of the Indian was ever her way when circumstance raised no barriers;

the four walls of a house were a prison to her after the days lengthened and

the summer nights grew warm. To the infinite disapproval of that custodian of

propriety, Mrs. Dax, she would make her bed beneath the stars, night after

night, and bathe in the cold, clear waters of the stream that purled from the

white-capped crest of the mountains.


“Nasty Injun ways!” scoffed Leander’s masterful lady,

consciously superior from the intrenchment of her stuffy bedroom, that boasted

crochet-work on the backs of the chairs and a scant lace curtain at its

solitary window.


Judith, going to her favorite pool to bathe, saw that it had shrunk till it

seemed but a fairy well hid among the willows. A quarter of a mile above was

another pool, hidden like a jewel in its case of green, broidered with scarlet

roseberries and white clematis; and towards this she bent her steps, as time

was a-plenty that morning. She kept to the stones of the creek for a pathway,

jumping lightly from those that were moss-grown to those that hid their

nakedness in the dark, velvet shadows of early morning, her white feet touching

the shallow stream like pale gulls that dipped and skimmed.

“Diana’s Pool,” as she called it, was always clear. It lay

half hid beneath a shelving rock, a fount for the tiny, white fall that crooned

and sang as it fell. And here she bathed, as the east flamed where the

mountains blackened against it. Gold halos tipped the clouds, that melted

presently into fiery waves, then burst into one great aureole through which the

sun rode triumphant, and it was day.


She had kept post-office the day before, and it would not be till day after

to-morrow that the squires of the lariat would come again to offer their

hearts, their worldly goods, their complete reformation, if she would only

change her mind. It was all such an old story that she had grown to regard them

with a tenderness almost maternal. But to-day was all her own, and the spirit

of adventure swelled high in her bosom as she thought of what she had planned.

It was warm and close and still in the Dax house as Judith made her way softly

to her own room and began her preparations for the long journey she was to take

afoot. To walk in the abominations devised by the white man for the purpose of

cramping his feet would have been a serious handicap to Judith. The twenty

miles that she would walk before nightfall was no very great undertaking to

her, but it was part of her primitive directness to accomplish it with as

little expenditure of fatigue and comfort as possible. Moreover, who could

steal through the forest in those heeled things without announcing his coming

and frightening the forest folk, and sending them skurrying? And Judith loved

to surprise them and see them busy with their affairs—to creep along in

her soft, elk-hide moccasins and catch their watchful eyes and see the things

that were not for the heavy-booted white man.


She might have inspired Kitty Colebrooke to a sonnet as she stepped out into

the glad morning light, in short skirt and jacket, green-clad as the pines that

girdled the mountains, with a knapsack with rations of bread and meat and the

wherewithal to build a fire should she wander belated. She softly closed the

door, not to awaken Leander and his slumbering lady, and broke into the running

gait that the Indians use on their all-day journeys, the elk-hide moccasins

falling soft as snow-flakes on the trail. Dolly she missed chiefly for her

companionship, for Judith had not the white man’s utter helplessness

without a horse in this country of high altitudes. When she walked she

breathed, carried herself, covered ground like her mother’s people, and

loved the inspiration of it.


The eerie shadows of the desert drew back and hid themselves in the mountains.

The day began with splendid promise—the day of the wolf-hunt, of which no

word had been spoken to her by Peter. She, too, was going hunting, but silently

and unbidden she would steal through the forest and see this mysterious woman

who played fast and loose with Peter, who loved her apparently all the better

for the game she played. What manner of woman could do these things? What

manner of woman could be indifferent to Peter? Judith was consumingly curious

to see. And, apart from this naked and unashamed curiosity, there was the

possibility that at sight of Miss Colebrooke there might come a relaxation of

Peter’s tyrannous hold upon her thoughts, her life, her very

heart’s blood. Would her loyalty bear the test of seeing Peter made a

fool of by a woman she could dismiss with a shrug—a softly speaking

shrew, perhaps, who played a waiting game with her finger on the pulse of

Peter’s prospects? For there was talk of a partnership with the Wetmores.

Or a fool, perhaps, for all her sonneting, for there are men who relish a weak

headpiece as the chiefest ornament of women, especially when its indeterminate

vagaries boast an escape-valve remotely connected with the fine arts. Or a

devil-woman, perhaps—an upright wanton who could think no wrong from very

poverty of temperament, yet kept him dangling. The possibility of Kitty’s

honesty, Judith in her jealousy would not admit. Had she gone to the devil for

him, stood and faced the drift of opinion for his sake, that Judith could have

understood. But what was the spinning of verses to a woman’s portion of

loving and being loved? Even Alida, through all her distracting anxieties, had

in her heart the thrice-blessed leaven, reasoned the woman of the plains, who

might, according to modern standards, be reckoned a trifle primitive in her

psychological deductions. And, withal, Judith was forced to admit that there

was something simple and true about a man who would let a woman make a fool of

him, whoever the woman was.


Perhaps with this hunting would end the long reign of Peter as a divinity.

Judith was tired, not in her vigorous young body, because that was strong and

healthful as the hill wind, but tired in heart and mind and life. Her destiny

had not been beautiful or happy before he invaded it, but it had been calm, and

now serenity seemed the worthiest gift of the gods. It was not that she loved

him less, but that she had so long reflected upon him that her imagination was

numb; her thoughts, arid, unfruitful as the desert, turned from him to the

problems that beset her, and from them back to him again, in dull, subconscious

yearning. She could no longer project an anguished consciousness to those

scenes wherein he walked and talked with Kitty. Her Indian fatalism had

intervened. “Life was life,” to be lived or left. And yet she felt

herself a poor creature, one who had lived long on illusion, who had bent her

neck to the yoke of arid unrealities. The pale-haired woman who kept him with

her miserliness of self, who intruded no sombre tragedy of loving, was well

worth a trip across the foot-hills to see. And yet, Judith reflected, it was

the portion of her mother’s daughter to make of loving the whole business

of life, even if she rebelled and fought against it as an accursed destiny. It

was in her inheritance to know and live for the wild thrill of ecstasy in her

pulses, to feel trembling joy and despair and frantic hope, that exacted its

tribute hardly less poignant; as it was, also, to feel a shivering

sensitiveness in regard to the loneliness and bitterness of her life, to have

the same measureless capacity for sorrow that she had for loving, to have a

soul attuned to the tragedy of things, to love the mighty forces about her, to

feel the reflection of all their moods in her heart, and, lastly, it was her

destiny to be the daughter of a half-Sioux and a border adventurer, and to feel

the counter influences of the two races make forever of her heart a

battleground.


Her light feet scarcely touched the ground as she sped swiftly through all the

network of the hills; and more than once her woman’s heart asked the

question, “And, prithee, Judith, if from henceforth you are only to hold

fellowship with the stars and have no part in the ways of men, why do you walk

a day’s journey to catch a glimpse of a pale-haired woman?”


She knew the probable course of the wolf-hunt. She had been on scores of them,

galloped with Peter after the fleeing gray thing that swept along the ground

like the nucleus of a whirling dust-devil. At least she was sure of the place

of their nooning—a limpid stream that ran close to many young pine-trees.

Here was a pause in the rugged ascent, a level space of open green, thick with

buffalo grass. Many times had she been here with Peter, sometimes with many

other people on the chase—sometimes, and these occasions were enshrined

in her memory, each with its own particular halo, with Peter alone; and they

had fished for trout and cooked their supper on the grassy levels. It was in

Judith’s planning to arrive before the hunting-party, to hide among the

thickets of scrub pine that grew along the steep cliffs and overlooked the

grassy level, to take her fill of looking at the pale-haired girl and the

hunters at their merrymaking, and, when she had seen, to steal back across the

trail to the Daxes’. They would not penetrate the thickets where she

meant to hide, and, should they, she was prepared for that contingency, too.

She had brought with her a bright-colored shawl that she would throw over her

head, and with the start of them she could outrun them all, even Peter. Had she

not outdistanced him easily, many times, in fun? Through the tangle of

tree-trunks that grew not far from the thicket, they would think she was but a

poor Shoshone squaw lying in wait for the broken meat of the revellers.


By crossing and recrossing the tiny creeks that trickled slow and obstructed

through the gaunt levels of plain and foot-hill, she had come by a direct route

to the fringes of the pine country. And here she found a world dim, green, and

mysterious. It was wellnigh inconceivable that the land of sage-brush and

silence could, within walking distance of desolation, show such wealth of young

timber, such shade and beauty. Her noiseless footfalls scarce startled a

sage-hen that, realizing too late her presence, froze to the dead stump—a

ruffled gray excrescence with glittering bead eyes that stared at her

furtively, the one live thing in the tense body.


The sun wanted an hour of noon when Judith rested by the stream, bathed her

face and hands, flushed from the long walk, ate the bread and meat, then lay on

the bed of pine-needles, brown and soft from the weathering of many suns and

snows. She had been all day in the company she loved best—the earth, the

sky, the sun and wind—and in her heart at last was a deep tranquillity.

Thus she could face life and ask nothing but to watch the cloud fleeces as they

are spun and heaped high in the long days of summer; in soberer moods to watch

the thoughts of the Great Mystery as He reveals them in the shifting cloud

shapes; to penetrate further and further into the councils of the great forces.

Thus did she dream the moments away till the sun was high in the blue and threw

long, yellow splashes of light on her still body, on the soft pine-needles,

beneath the boughs. But there was no time for further day-dreams if she

intended to forestall the hunters at the place of nooning. She followed a game

trail that lay along the stream, ascending through the dense growths till she

reached the top of the jutting rocks. Her hair was loosened, her skirt awry,

and the pine-needles stood out from it as from a cushion. Much of the way she

gained by creeping beneath the low branches on her hands and knees. No white

woman would be likely to follow her reasoned the daughter of the plains. It

would be a little too hard on her appearance. And here, by lying flat and

hanging over the jutting knob of rock, with a pine branch in her hand, she

could see this mysterious woman and Peter and the hunters.


She broke a branch to shade her face, she looked down on the grassy level. She

waited, but there was no sound of hoofs falling muffled on the soft ground. The

shadows of the pines contended with the splashes of sunlight for the little

world beneath the trees. They trembled in mimic battle, then the shadows stole

the sunlight, bit by bit, till all was pale-green twilight, and there was no

sound of the hunters.


The hunters, meanwhile, had not been altogether successful in the chase. The

necessary wolf had been coy, and they, perforce, had to compromise with his

poor relation, the coyote—a poor relation, indeed, whose shabby coat,

thinned by the process of summer shedding, made it an unworthy souvenir to Miss

Colebrooke. But it was not the lack of a wolf that robbed the hunting-party of

its zest for Kitty. She could not tell what it was, but something seemed to

have gone wrong with the day from the beginning. She rode beside her cavalier

in a habit the like of which the country had never before seen, and Peter,

usually the most observant of men, had no word for its multitude of

perfections. In the first realization of disappointment with the day, the hunt,

the hardships of the long ride, her perturbed consciousness took up the problem

of this missing element and tried to adjust itself to the irritating absence.

Kitty wondered if it were something she had forgotten. No, there were her two

little cambric pocket-handkerchiefs, remotely suggestive of orris, and bearing

her monogram delicately wrought and characteristic. It was not her watch, the

ribbon fob of which fluttered now and then in the breeze. It was not veil nor

scarf-pin nor any of the paraphernalia of the properly garbed horsewoman. And

yet there was something missing, something she should have had with her,

something the absence of which was taking the savor from the day’s

hunting.


It must be the very bigness of this great, splendid world that gave her the

sense of being alone at sea. Intuitively she turned and looked at Peter riding

beside her. There was something in his face that made her look again before

accepting the realization at first incredulously, then with frank amusement.

Peter had scarcely spoken since they left the ranch. She had come down to

breakfast so sure of her new riding-habit. The Wetmore girls had been moved to

hyperboles about its cut and fit and the trim shortness of the

skirt—short riding-skirts were something of a novelty then. The fine gold

hair, twisted tight at the back of the shapely head, was like a coiled mass of

burnished metal, some safe-keeping device of mint or gold-worker till the

season of coining or fashioning should come round. The translucent flesh-tints,

pearl-white flushing into pink—“Bouguereau realized at last,”

as Nannie Wetmore was in the habit of summing up her cousin’s

complexion—was as marvellous as ever. The delicate firmness of profile

gave to the face the artificial perfection of an old miniature, rather than of

a flesh-and-blood countenance, and all these were there as of yore, but the

marvel of them failed of the customary tribute. Kitty, on scanty reflection,

was at no loss to translate Peter’s reserve into a language at once

flattering and retributive. In her scheme of life he was always to be her

devoted cavalier, as indeed he had been from the beginning. She loved her own

small eminence too well to imperil her tenure of it by sharing its pretty view

of men and things with any one. In country house parties she loved the mild

wonder that the successful littérateuse could fight and play and win her social

triumphs so well. She loved the star part, and next to playing it she enjoyed

wresting it from other women or eclipsing them completely in some conspicuously

minor rôle, while, in the matter of dress, Miss Colebrooke went beyond the

point decreed by the most exigent mandates of fashion. When hats were worn over

the face, her admirers had to content themselves with a glimpse of her charming

mouth and chin. When they flared, hers fairly challenged the laws of

equilibrium. She danced with the same facility with which she rode, swam, and

played tennis. In doing these things supremely well she felt that she

vindicated the position of the woman of letters. Why should one be a frump

because one wrote?


Her friendship with Peter was to endure to greenest old age, more platonic,

perhaps, than that of Madame Récamier and Chateaubriand. It was to be fruitful

in letters that would compare favorably with the best of the seventeenth

century series. Even now her own letters to Peter were no sprightly scrawl of

passing events, but efforts whose seriousness suggested, at least in their

carefully elaborated stages of structure, the letters of the ladies of

Cranford.


But in the course of these Western wanderings, undertaken not wholly without

consideration of Peter, there had appeared in the maplike exactness of her

plans an indefinite territory that threatened undreamed-of proportions. It

menaced the scheme of the letters, it shook the foundations of the

Chateaubriand-Récamier friendship. The unknown quantity was none other than the

frequent and irritating mention of one Judith Rodney, who, from all accounts,

appeared a half-breed. Her name, her beauty, some intrinsic charm of

personality made her an all too frequent topic, except in the case of Peter. He

had been singularly keen in scenting any interrogatory venue that led to the

mysterious half-breed; when questioned he persistently refused to exhibit her

as a type.


Kitty knew that she had treated her long-suffering cavalier with scant

consideration the day he had spurred across the desert to see her. True, she

had written him on her arrival, but, with feminine perversity of logic, thought

it a trifle inconsiderate of him to come so soon after that trying railroad

journey. An ardent resumption of his suit—and Peter could be depended on

for renewing it early and often—was farthest from her inclination at that

particular time. She intended to salve her conscience at the wolf-hunt for her

casual reception of his impetuous visit. But apparently Peter did not intend to

be prodigal of opportunity.


“How garrulous you people are this morning!” Nannie Wetmore

challenged them. Peter came out of his brown study with the look of one who has

again returned to earth.


“You don’t find it like the drop-curtain of a theatre, now that

you’ve seen it?” he questioned Kitty. For she had doubted her

pleasure in the mountains, in the conviction that they would be too dramatic

for her simple taste.


Kitty closed her eyes and sighted the peaks as if she were getting the color

scheme for an afternoon toilet.


“Mass, bulk, rather than line—no, it’s not like a

drop-curtain, but it’s distinctly ‘hand-painted.’ All it

needs is a stag surveying the prospect from that great cliff. It’s the

kind of thing that would sound well in a description. Oh, I assure you I intend

to make lavish use of it, but it leaves nothing to one’s poor

imagination!”


Peter had a distinct feeling of being annoyed. No, she could not appreciate the

mountains any more than they could appreciate her. They were incongruous,

antipathetic, antipodal. Kitty, in her pink and white and flaxen prettiness and

her trim habit, was in harmony with the bridle-path of a city park; in this

great, lonely country she was an alien. He thought of Judith and the night they

had climbed Horse-Thief Trail, of her quiet endurance, her keen pleasure in the

wild beauty of the night, her quality of companionship, her loyalty, her silent

bearing of many burdens. Yet until he had seen them both against the same

relentless background, he had never been conscious of comparing the two women.


Nannie Wetmore had fallen behind. She was riding with a bronzed young

lieutenant from Fort Washakie. The two ahead rode long without speaking. Then

Peter broke the silence impatiently:


“You did not really mean that, did you?” He was boyishly hurt at

her flippant summing up of his beloved blue country. And Kitty, tired with the

long, hard ride, and missing that something in Peter that had always been hers,

turned on him a pair of blue eyes in which the tears were brimming

suspiciously. They were well out of sight of the others, and had come to the

heavy fringes of a pine wood. Was it the psychological moment at last? Then

suddenly their horses, that had been sniffing the air suspiciously, stopped.

Kitty’s horse, which was in advance of Peter’s, rushed towards the

thicker growth of pines as if all Bedlam were in pursuit. Peter’s horse,

swerving from the cause of alarm, bolted back across the trail over which they

had just made their way. A large brown bear, feeding with her cub, and hidden

by the trees till they were directly in front of her, had caused the alarm.


And presently the hush of the shadowy green world in which Judith lay was

broken by a light, sobbing sound. It had been so still that, lying on her bed

of pine-needles, she had likened it to great waves of silence, rolling up from

the valley, breaking over her and sweeping back again, noiseless, green from

the billowing ocean of pine branches, and sunlit. Judith bent over the rocky

ledge and saw a girl making her way down the game trail, dishevelled and

tearful. Her hat was gone, her pale-yellow hair, that in shadow had the

greenish tinge of corn-silk, blew about her shoulders, her trim skirt was torn

and dusty, and she looked about, bewildered, hardly realizing that through the

unexpected course of things she had been stranded in this great world of sunlit

splendor and loneliness. She closed her eyes. The awful vastness and solitude

oppressed her with a deepening sense of calamity. Suppose they never found her?

How could she find her way in this endless wilderness, afoot? She sank to the

turf and began to cry hysterically.


Judith knew in a flash of instant cognition that this was Miss Colebrooke.

Amazement seemed to have dulled her powers of action—amazement that she,

who had stolen to this place and crouched close to earth that she might see the

triumph of this preferred woman, and, having seen and paid her grievous dole,

steal away and take up the thread of endless little things that spun for her

the web of life, was forced instead to be an unwilling witness of the

other’s distress. Judith had risen with her first impulse, which had been

to go to Kitty, but half-way through the thicket she hesitated and

reconsidered. Undoubtedly Peter would come soon, and Peter’s consolation

would be more potent than any she could offer. She shrank in shuddering

self-consciousness at the thought of her presence at their meeting, the

uninvited guest, the outgrown friend and confidante, blundering in at such a

time, pitifully full of good intentions. She recoiled from the picture as from

a precipice that all unwittingly she had escaped. What madness had induced her

to come on this expedition? A sudden panic at the possibility of discovery

possessed her; suppose Peter should find her skulking like a beggar, waiting

for broken meats? She looked at the image of herself that she carried in her

heart. It was that of a proud woman who made no moan at the scourge of the

inevitable. Many burdens had she carried in her proud, lonely heart, but of

them her lips gave no sign. In her contemplative stoicism she felt with pride

that she was no unworthy daughter of her mother’s people, and catching a

glimpse through the trees of the abjectly waiting woman who, though safe and

sound, could but wait, wretched and dispirited, for some one to come and adjust

her to the situation, Judith felt for her a wondering pity at her helplessness.

She waited, expectant, for the sound of Peter’s horse. Surely he must

come at any moment, overcome with apologies, and she—Judith hid her face

in her hands at the thought—she would steal away through the thicket at

the first sound of hoofs. But as the minutes slipped by and still no sign of

Peter, a sickening anxiety began to gnaw at her heart. Had something happened

to him?


She did not wait to ask herself the question twice. She crawled the length of

the thicket with incredible rapidity, gained the pine forest, and made her way

beneath the low-hanging boughs; without stopping to protect herself from them

she gained the open space and ran quickly to Kitty.


“Are you hurt? What has happened?”


Kitty looked up, startled at the voice. She had not heard the sound of the

moccasined feet. Her wandering, forlorn thoughts crystallized at sight of the

woman before her. A new lightning leaped into her eyes as she recognized

Judith. There was between them a thrilling consciousness that gave to their

mutual perception a something sharp and fine, that grasped the drama of the

moment with the precision and fidelity of a camera. And through all the wonder

of the meeting there was in the heart of each an outflowing that met and

mingled and understood the potential tragedy element of the situation.


“You are Miss Rodney, I believe?”


Kitty was conscious of something strange in her voice as she looked into the

dark eyes, wide with questioning fear. Ah, but she had amazing beauty, and a

something that seemed of the very essence of deep-souled womanliness! The two

women presented a fine bit of antithesis, Kitty, flower-like, small, delicately

wrought, the finished product of the town, exotic as some rare transplanted

orchid growth. And in Judith there was a gemlike quality: it was in the bloom

of her skin, the iridescent radiance of her hair, that was bluish, like a plum

in sunlight; it was in the warm, red life in her lips, in the pulsing vitality

of the slim, brown throat; in every line was sensuous force restrained by

spiritual passion.


Kitty told of the accident in which her horse had thrown her and disappeared in

the pine fringes, leaving her stunned for a moment or two; and how she had

finally pulled herself together and followed what appeared to be a trail, in

the hope of finding some one. She dwelt long on the details of the accident.


“Yes, but Peter, what has happened him?” Judith chose her words

impatiently. She was racked with anxiety at his long delay, and now she hung

over Kitty, waiting for her answer, without the semblance of a cloak for her

alarm.


There was reproof in Kitty’s amendment. “I don’t know which

way Mr. Hamilton’s horse went. It started back over the trail, I

think.”


Judith clasped her hands. “Let us go and look for him. Why do we waste

time?” But Kitty hung back. She was shaken from her fall, and upset by

the events of the morning. Besides, her faith in Peter’s ability to cope

with all the exigencies of this country was supreme. And chiefest reason of all

for her not going was a something within her that winced at the thought of this

fellowship that had for its object the quest of Peter.


“Oh, don’t you see,” pleaded Judith, “that if something

had not happened to him he would have been here long ago?”


Judith’s anxiety awoke in Kitty a new consciousness. What was she to him,

that at the possibility of harm, a fear not shared by Kitty, she should throw

off a reserve that every line of her face pronounced habitual? In her very

energy of attitude, an energy that all unconsciously communicated itself to

Kitty, there was the power that belongs to all elemental human

emotion—the power that compels. Kitty rose to follow Judith, then

hesitated.


“I’m sure nothing has happened him. No, I’m really too

unstrung by my fall to walk.” She sank again to the bowlder on which she

had been sitting.


To the woman of the world, Judith’s ingenuous display of feeling had in

its very sincerity a something pitiable. How could she strip from her soul

every fold of reserve and stand unloved and unashamed, sanctified, as it were,

by the very hopelessness of her passion? How could women make of their whole

existence a thing to be rejected, reflected Kitty, who, giving nothing, could

not understand. She looked again at the bronzed face beside her, so bold in

outline, so expressive in detail. Yes, she was beautiful, and yet, what had her

beauty availed her? The thought that she herself was the preferred woman

throbbed through her for a moment with a sense of exaltation. The next moment a

haunting doubt laid hold of her heart, held up mockingly the little that she

and Peter had lived through together, the lofty plane of friendship along which

she had tried to lead his unwilling feet sedately, his protests, his frank

amusement at her serious pretensions to a career. How much fuller might not

have been the intercourse between him and this woman, who, in all probability,

had been his comrade for years? And she had been idealizing him, and his love

for her, and his loneliness! Kitty stood with eyes cast down, while images

crowded upon her, leaving her cold and smiling.


“But think,” pleaded Judith; “if you don’t come it will

take me longer to search the trail-marks. You could show me just where the

horses ran—”


Kitty’s eyes were still on the ground. She did not lift them, and Judith,

realizing that further appeal was but a waste of time, turned and ran swiftly

down the trail.


“He is her lover,” said Kitty; and all the wilderness before her

was no lonelier than her heart.


Swift, intent, Judith traced Kitty’s footprints. They followed the game

trail, the one she herself had taken earlier in the day. She traced them back

through the pine wood about a hundred rods, and then the trail-marks grew

confused. This was unquestionably the place where the horses had taken fright,

circled, reared, then dashed in different directions. She traced the other

horse, whose tracks led under low-hanging boughs. It would have been a

difficult matter for a horse with a rider to clear; and now the impression of

the horse’s shoes grew fainter, from the lighter footfalls of a horse at

full gallop.


“Ah!” A cry broke from her as she saw the marks had become almost

eliminated by something that had dragged, something heavy. Those long-drawn

lines were finger-prints, where a hand had dragged in its vain endeavor to

grasp at something. A sickening image came persistently before her

eyes—Peter’s upturned face, blood-smeared and disfigured.


“Sh-sh-sh!” She put her hand to her breast to still the beating of

her heart. She could hear the sound of hoofs falling muffled on the soft

ground, and a man’s voice speaking in a soothing sing-song. She listened.

It was Peter’s voice, reassuring the horse, asking him what kind of a bag

of nerves he was for a cow pony, to get frightened at a bear? Judith stood tall

and straight among the pines. Surely he could not blindly pass her by. He must

feel the joy in her heart that all was well with him. The hoofs came nearer,

the man’s voice sounded but intermittently, as he got his horse under

better control. She felt as if he must come to her, as if some overpowering

consciousness of her presence would speak from her heart to his; but his eyes

scanned the distant trail for a glimpse of Kitty or Kitty’s horse. Judith

saw that his head was bound in something white and that it bore a red stain,

but he held himself well in the saddle. He was not the man to heed a tumble. He

urged the horse forward, never looking towards the tree-trunks, his face white

and strained with anxiety as he scoured the trail for evidences of Kitty. The

horse, with a keener sense than his master, shied slightly as he passed the

group of pines where Judith stood; but Peter’s glance was for the open

trail, and as she heard him canter by, so close that she could have touched his

stirrup with her hand, it seemed as if he must hear the beating of her heart.


“Oh, blind eyes, and ears that will not hear, and heart that has

forgotten how to beat! Yes, go to that pale, cold girl! You speak one language,

and life for you is the way of little things!”


She waited till the last sound of the horse’s hoofs had died away and all

was still in the tremulous green of the forest. Judith’s mind was busy

with the image of their meeting, the man bringing the joy of his youth to the

calm divinity who could feel no thrill of fear in his absence. She broke into

the running gait and hurried through the forest to the Daxes’.


XVI.

In The Land Of The Red Silence


The beef-herd, that had been the pivotal point of the round-up and had made the

mighty plain echo to its stampings and bellowings, beating up simooms that

choked it with thirst, blinded it with dust, confounding itself on every side

by the very fury of its blind force, had trailed for a week, tractable as toys

in the hands of children. Little had happened to vary the monotony for the

cow-punchers that handled the herd—they grazed, guarded, watered,

night-herded the cattle day after day, night after night. Pasturage had been

sufficient, if not abundant. The creeks were running low and slimy with the

advance of summer, but there had been sufficient water to let the herd drink

its fill at least once a day.


The outfit ate its “sow-belly,” soda-biscuit, and coffee three

times a day, and smoked its pipes, but was a little shy on yarns round the

camp-fire.


“This yere outfit don’t lather none,” commented the cook to

the horse-wrangler, over the smoke of an early morning fire.


“Don’t lather no more than a chunk of wood,” agreed the

horse-wrangler. “That’s the trouble with a picked-up outfit like

this. Catch ‘W-square’ men kowtowing to a ‘XXX’ boss,

even if he is only acting foreman.”


Simpson, the origin of whose connection with the “XXX” was rather a

sensitive subject with that outfit, had begun to take his duties as a

cattle-man with grim seriousness; he was untiring in his labors; he spent long

hours in the saddle, he took his turn at night herding, though he was old for

this kind of work. He condemned the sheep-men with foul-mouthed denunciations,

scoffed at their range-rights, said the sheep question should be dealt with in

the business-like manner in which the Indian question had been settled. He was

an advocate of violence—in short, a swaggering, bombastic wind-bag. He

talked much of “his outfit” and “his men.” “What

was good enough for them was good enough for him,” he would announce at

meal-time, in a snivelling tone, when the food happened to be particularly bad.

He split the temporary outfit, brought together for the purpose of handling the

beef-herd, into factions. He put the “XXX” in worse repute than it

already enjoyed—he was, in fact, the discordant spirit of the expedition.

The men attended to their work sullenly. Discord was rife. The one thought they

shared in common was that of the wages that would come to them at the end of

the drive; of the feverish joy of “blowing in,” in a single night;

perchance, of forgetting, in one long, riotous evening, the monotony, the

hardship, the lack of comradery that made this particular drive one long to be

remembered in the mind of every man who had taken part in it.


Meanwhile the herd trailed its half-mile length to the slaughtering pens day

after day, all unconscious of its power. When the steers had trailed for about

a fortnight, the question of finding sufficient water for them began to be a

serious one. The preceding winter had been unusually mild, the snow-fall on the

mountains averaging less than in the recollection of the oldest plains-man.

Summer had begun early and waxed hot and dry. The earth began to wrinkle, and

cracked into trenches, like gaping mouths, thirsty for the water that came not.

Such streams as had not dried shrank and crawled among the willows like slimy

things, that the herd, thirsty though it was from the long drives, had to be

coaxed to drink from.


Discontent grew. The acting foreman, who was a “XXX” man, and a

comparative stranger to that part of the country, refused to consult with the

“W-square” men in the outfit, who knew every inch of the ground.

The acting foreman thought the Wetmore men looked down on him, “put on

dog”; and, to flaunt his authority, he ordered the herd driven due west

instead of skirting to the north by the longer route, where they would have had

the advantage of drinking at several creeks before crossing Green River.

Moreover, the acting foreman was drinking hard, and he insisted upon his order

in spite of the Wetmore men’s protestations.


The character of the country began to change, the soil took on the color of

blood, even the omnipresent sage-brush began to fail the landscape;

sun-bleached bones glistened on the red soil, white as ulcers. All the animal

trails led back from the country into which they were proceeding. The sky, a

vivid, cloudless blue, paled as it dipped earthward. The sun looked down, a

flaming copper shield. There was no sign of life in all the land. Even the

grasshoppers had left it to the sun, the silence, and the desolation. To ears

accustomed to the incessant shrilling of the insects, the cessation was

ominous, like the sudden stopping of a clock in a chamber of death. Above the

angry bellow of the thirsty herd the men strained their ears again and again

for this familiar sound of life, but there was nothing but the bellowing of the

cattle, the trampling of their hoofs, and sometimes the long, squealing whinny

of a horse as he threw back his head in seeming demand to know the justice of

this thing.


Across the red plain snailed the herd, like a many-jointed, prehistoric reptile

wandering over the limitless spaces of some primeval world. A cloud of red dust

hung over them in a dense haze, trailed after them a weary length, then all was

featureless monotony as before. What were a thousand steers, a handful of men

and horses, in the land of the red silence? It had seen the comings and goings

of many peoples, and once it had flowed with streams; but that was before the

curse of God came upon it, and in its harsh, dry barrenness it grew to be a

menace to living things.


The saddle-stock had been watered at some fetid alkali holes that had scarce

given enough to slake their thirst. The effect of the water had weakened them,

and the steers that had been without water for thirty-six hours were being

pushed on a course slightly northwest as rapidly as the enfeebled condition of

the saddle-horses would permit. Creek after creek that they had made for proved

to be but a dry bed.


The glare of the red earth, under the scourge of the flaming sun, tormented the

eyes of the men into strange illusions. The naked red plain stretched flat like

the colossal background of a screen, over which writhed a huge dragon, spined

with many horns, headless, trailing its tortuous way over the red world.

Sometimes it was as unreal as a fever-haunted dream, a drug-inspired nightmare,

when a Chinese screen, perchance, has stood at the foot of the sleeper’s

bed. Sometimes the dragon curled itself into a ball, and the foreman sung out

that they were milling, and the men turned and rode away from it, then dashed

back at it, after getting the necessary momentum, entered like a flying wedge,

fought their way into the rocking sea of surging bodies, shouted from their

thirst-parched throats imprecations that were lost in the dull, sullen roar.

Then the dragon would uncoil and again trail its way over the red waste-lands.


A red sun had begun to set over a red earth, and the men who had been out since

noon-scouring the country for water, returned to say that none had been found,

and they began to look into each other’s faces for the answer that none

could give. At sunset they made a dry camp; there was but enough water left to

cook with. Each man received, as a thirst-quenching ration, a can of tomatoes.

After supper they consulted, and it was agreed to trail the herd till midnight,

taking advantage of the coolness to hurry them on as fast as possible to Green

River. The grave nature of their plight was indicated by the fact that no one

smoked after supper. Silent, sullen, they sat round, waiting for the foreman to

give the order to advance. He waited for the moon to come up. Slowly it rose

over the Bad Land Hills and hung round and full like a gigantic lantern. The

watches were arranged for the night with a double guard. Every man in the

outfit was beginning to have a feeling of panic that communicated itself to

every other man, and as they looked at the herd, tractable now no longer, but a

blind force that they must take chances with through the long watches of the

night, while the thirst grew in the beasts’ parched throats, they foresaw

what would in all probability happen; they thought of their women, of all that

most strongly bound them to life, and they sat and waited dumbly.


The moon that night was too brilliant for benisons; the gaunt, red world lay

naked and unshriven for the sin that long ago had brought upon it the wrath of

God. The picture was still that of the grotesque Chinese screen, with the

headless dragon crawling endlessly; but the dream was long, centuries long, it

seemed to the men listening to the bellowing of the herd. And while they

waited, the red grew dull and the dragon dingy, and its fury made its

contortions the more horrible; and that was all the difference between day and

night in the land of the red silence. Sometimes the dragon split, and joints of

it tried to turn back to the last water it had drunk; for cattle, though

blinded with thirst, never forget the last stream at which they have quenched

thirst, and will turn back to it, though they drop on the way. But the men

pressed them farther and farther, and for yet a little while the cattle

yielded.


At midnight the saddle-stock was incapable of moving farther. One horse had

fallen and lay too weak to rise. The others, limping and foot-sore, no longer

responded to quirt and rowel. The foreman ordered the herd thrown on the bed

ground for the night. The herders for the first watch began to circle. The rest

of the outfit took to its blankets to snatch a little rest for the double duty

that awaited every man that night. Now it is a time-honored belief among

cow-men that the herd must be sung to, particularly when it is restless, and

to-night they tried all the old favorites, the “Cow-boy’s

Lament” being chief among them. But the herd refused to be soothed, and

round and round it circled; not once would it lie down.


The moon gleamed almost brazen, showing the cruel scars, the trenches torn by

cloud-bursts, the lines wrought by the long, patient waiting of the earth for

the lifting of the wrath of God. Imperishable grief was writ on the land as on

a human face. The night wore on, the watches changed, the herd continued

restless; not more than a third of it had bedded down. The third watch was from

one o’clock to half-past three in the morning. Simpson and another

“XXX” man, with two of the Wetmore outfit, made up a double watch,

and rode, singing, about the herd, as the long, dreary watch wore away. The

cattle’s lowing had taken on a gasping, cracked sound that was more

frightful than the maddened bellow of the early evening. Simpson, who was past

the age when men live the life of the saddle, felt the hardship keenly. He had

ridden since sunrise, but for the respite at noon and the scant time at the dry

camp while the evening meal was being eaten. He was more than half asleep now,

as he lurched heavily in the saddle, crossing and recrossing his partner in the

half-circle they completed about the herd. Suddenly the sharp yelp of a coyote

rang out; it seemed to come from no farther than twenty yards away. The cattle

heard it, too, and a wave of panic swept through them. Simpson stiffened in his

saddle. The sound, which was repeated, was an exact reproduction of a

coyote’s yelp, yet he knew that it was not a coyote.


The herd rose to its feet as a single steer, and for a second stood

undetermined. From a clump of sage-brush not more than two feet high fluttered

something long and white like a sheet. It waved in the wind as the cry was

repeated. The herd crashed forward in a stampede, Simpson in the lead on a

tired horse, but a scant length ahead of a thousand maddened steers bolting in

a panic of thirst and fear.


“Hell’s loose!” yelled the men in their blankets, making for

the temporary rope corral to secure horses. Simpson, tallow-colored with fear,

clung like a cat to his horse, and dug the rowels in the beast’s flanks

till they were bloody and dripping. He had seen Jim Rodney’s face above

the white cloth as it fluttered in the face of the herd that came pounding

behind him with the rumble of nearing thunder. He was too close to them to

attempt to fire his revolver in the air in the hope of turning them, but the

boys had evidently got into their saddles, to judge by the volley of shots that

rang out and were answered. Simpson alone rode ahead of the herd that tore

after him, ripping up the earth as it came, bellowing in its blind fury. His

horse, a thoroughly seasoned cow-pony, sniffed the bedlam and responded to the

goading spur. She had been in cattle stampedes before, and, though every fibre

ached with fatigue, she flattened out her lean body and covered ground to the

length of her stride at each gallop. The herd was so close that Simpson could

smell the stench of their sweating bodies, taste their dust, and feel the

scorch of their breath. The sound of their hoofs was like the pounding of a

thousand propellers. From above looked the moon, round and serene; she had

watched the passing of many peoples in the land of the red silence. The horse

seemed to be gaining. A few more lengths ahead and Simpson could turn her to

one side and let the maddened cattle race to their own destruction. All he

asked of God was to escape their trampling hoofs, and though he gained he dug

the rowel and plied the quirt, unmindful of what he did. On they came; the

chorus of their fear swelled like the voice of a mighty cataract, the pound,

pound, pound of their hoofs ringing like mighty sledge-hammers.


Suddenly he felt himself sinking, horribly, irresistibly. “God! What is

it?” as his horse went down with her foreleg in a gopher-hole. “Up,

up, you damned brute!” but the mare’s leg had cracked like a

pipe-stem. In his fury at the beast Simpson began kicking her, then started to

run as the cattle swept forward like a black storm-cloud.


The next second the great sea of cattle had broken over horse and rider. When

it had passed there was not enough left of either to warrant burial or to

furnish a feast for the buzzards. A few shreds of clothes, that had once been a

man, lay scattered there; a something that had been a horse.


XVII.

Mrs. Yellett Contends With A Cloudburst


The matriarch had delayed longer in moving camp than was consistent with her

habitual watchfulness where the interests of the sheep were involved. Mary

Carmichael, who had already become inured to the experience of moving, was even

conscious of a certain impatience at the delay, and could only explain the

apathy with which Mrs. Yellett received reports of the dearth of pasturage on

the ground that she wished each fresh educational germ to take as deep root as

possible before transplantation. So that when Mrs. Yellett, shortly after

Leander Dax’s arrival at camp in the capacity of herder, announced that

she and Leander were to make a trip to the dipping-vat that had kept Ben from

his classes for the past ten days, and invited the “gov’ment”

to join the expedition, Mary accepted with fervor.


The Yelletts’ “bunch” of sheep did not exceed three thousand

head, and the matriarch had wisely decreed that it should be restricted to that

number, as she wished always to give the flock her personal supervision.


“‘The hen that’s the surest of her chicks is the one that

does her own settin’,’” was the adage from the Book of Hiram

with which Mrs. Yellett succinctly summed up the case.


Each autumn, therefore, the wethers and the dry-bag ewes were sent to the

market, and as the result of continual weeding of the stock the matriarch had

as promising a herd of its size as could be found in Wyoming. Often she had

explained to Mary, who was learning of the wonders of this new world with

remarkable aptness, that she had constantly to fight against the inclination to

increase her business of sheep-raising, but that as soon as she should begin to

hire herders or depend on strangers things would go wrong. With the assistance

of her sons, she therefore managed the entire details of the herd, with the

exception of those occasions on which Leander lent his semi-professional

co-operation.


As a workman Leander was, considering his size and apparent weakness,

surprisingly efficient. It was as a dispenser of anti-theological doctrine that

Mrs. Dax’s husband annoyed his temporary employer. Freed from his

wife’s masterful presence, Leander dared to be an “agnostic,”

as he called himself, of an unprecedentedly violent order. His iconoclasm was

not of a pattern with paw’s gusty protests against life in general, but

it was Leander’s way of asserting himself, on the rare occasions when he

got a chance, to deny clamorously every tenet advanced by every religion. The

mere use of certain familiar expletives drove him, ordinarily mild and

submissive though he was, to frantic gesticulation and diatribe. Mary

Carmichael could not make out, as she watched the comedy with growing

amusement, whether poor Leander really believed that he was the first of

doubting Thomases, or whether he took an unfair advantage of the lack of

general information in his casual audiences to set forth well-known opinions as

his own. Whatever its basis may have been, Leander sustained the rôle of

doubter with passionate zeal, wearing himself to tatters of rage and hoarseness

over arguments maliciously contrived beforehand by cow-punchers and

sheep-herders in need of amusement; and yet he never saw the traps, going out

of his way, apparently, to fall into them, tumbling headlong into the identical

pits time after time. Jonah and the whale constituted one bait by means of

which Leander could be lured from food, sleep, or work of the most pressing

nature.


“The poor fool would stop in the middle of shearing a sheep to argue that

Jonah never come out of the whale’s belly,” the matriarch had told

Mary Carmichael, in summing up Leander’s disadvantages as a herder. And

the first remark she had addressed to him on his arrival was: “Leander

Dax, you’d have to be made over, and made different, to keep you from

bein’ a infidel, but there’s one p’int on which you are

particularly locoed, and that’s Jonah and the whale. Now at this

particular time in the hist’ry of the United States, nobody in his

faculties has got no call to fret hisself over Jonah and his

whereabouts—none whatever. There’s a lot of business round this

here camp that’s a heap more pressin’. Now, Leander Dax, if I do

hereby undertake to hire, engage, and employ you to herd sheep, do you agree to

renounce discussions, arguments, and debates on the late Jonah and his

whereabouts durin’ them three days? God A’mighty, man, any one

would think you was Jonah’s wife, the interest you have in his

absence!”


“I come here to herd sheep,” Leander had brazenly retaliated.

“I ’ain’t come to try to make you think.”


Nevertheless, he appeared docile enough as the time came for the journey to the

dipping-vat, and did his part in making ready. The wagon was the rudest of

structures; it consisted merely of one long, stout pole. Though she saw the

horses being harnessed to this pole, Mary Carmichael, discreetly exercising her

newly acquired wisdom, forbore to ask where she was going to sit, and listened

with interest to a discussion between Mrs. Yellett and Leander as to the number

of horses it would take to get the dip up the mountain. Leander, who loved pomp

and splendor, was for taking six, but Mrs. Yellett, who carried simplicity to a

fault, was in favor of only two. They finally compromised on four, and Leander

went to fetch the extra two.


Mrs. Yellett, ever economical of the flitting moment, took advantage of the

delay to give Mr. Yellett a dose of “Brainard’s Beneficial

Blackthorn.”


“Paw’s as hard to manage as a bent pin,” she remarked, in an

aside to Mary, while he protested and fought her off with his stick. But she,

with the agility of an acrobat, got directly back of him, took his head under

her arm, pried open his mouth, and poured down the unwelcome, if beneficial,

dose.


“There, there, paw,” she said, wiping his mouth as if he had been a

baby, “don’t take on so! It’s all gone, and I can’t

have you sick on my hands.”


But Mr. Yellett continued to splutter and flare and use violent language,

whereupon the matriarch went into the tent and returned with a drink of

condensed-milk and water, “to wash down the nasty taste,” she told

him, soothingly.


A moment afterwards she and Leander were engaged in rolling the barrels of

sheep-dip to the wagon, Mary Carmichael helplessly looking on while Mrs.

Yellett looked doubtfully at a “gov’ment” who could not

handle barrels. Finally, under the skilful manipulation of Mrs. Yellett and

Leander, the long pole took on the aspect of a colossal vertebral column, from

which huge barrel-ribs projected horizontally, leaving at the rear a foot or so

of bare pole as a smart caudal appendage, bearing about the same proportion to

the wagon as the neatly bitten tail of a fox-terrier does to the dog.


Mrs. Yellett kissed “paw” good-bye, explaining to Mary, in

extenuation of her weakness, that she would never forgive herself if she

neglected it and anything happened to him during her absence. She then climbed

to the front barrel and secured the ribbons. Leander had brought out three

rolls of bedding of the inevitable bed-quilt variety, but Mrs. Yellett scorned

such luxury while driving, and accordingly gave hers to the

“gov’ment” for a back-rest. Mary sat on the lower row of

barrels, with her feet dangling, using one roll of bedding for a seat and the

other comfortably arranged at her back as a cushion.


Madam called sharply to the horses, “Hi-hi-hi-kerat!

hi-kerat-kerat!” and they started off at a rattling pace, the barrels of

dip creaking and squeaking as they swayed under their rope lashings. Mary

bounced about like a bean in a bag, working loose from between the bed-quilt

rolls at each gulley, clinging frantically to barrel ends, shaken back and

forth like a shuttle. Indeed, the drive seemed to combine every known form of

physical exercise. Mrs. Yellett herself was in fine fettle; she drove sitting

for a while, then rose, standing on a narrow ledge while she held the four

ribbons lightly in one hand and tickled the leaders with a long whip carried in

the other. She drove her four horses over the rough road with the skill of a

circus equestrienne, balancing easily on the crazy ledge, shifting her weight

from side to side as the wagon rattled down gullies and up ridges, the horses

responding gallantly to the shrill “Hi-hi-kerat! hi-kerat!

hi-kerat!” Her costume on this occasion represented joint concessions to

her sex and the work that was before her, as the head of a family at the

dipping-vat. She still wore the drum-shaped rabbit-skin cap pulled well down

over her forehead for driving. The great, cable-like braids of hair stood out

well below the cap, giving her head an appearance of denseness and solidity,

but the rambling curls were still blowing about her face, perhaps adding to the

sum total of grotesqueness. She wore a man’s shirt of gray flannel, well

open at the neck, from which the bronzed column of the throat rose in austere

dignity. A pair of Mr. Yellett’s trousers, stuffed into high,

cow-puncher’s boots, that met the hem of a skirt coming barely to the

knees, contributed to the originality of her dress.


The wagon had been pitching like a ship at sea through the desert dreariness

for about an hour, when Mary Carmichael suddenly became conscious that the

prods she had been receiving from time to time in her back were not due either

to their manner of locomotion or to the freight carried. Clinging to two

barrels, she waited for the next lurch of the wagon to shake her free from the

rolls of bedding, and, at the peril of life and limb, looked round. Leander

hung over the top row of barrels, gesticulating wildly. The change in the man,

since leaving camp some two hours previous, was appalling. He seemed to have

shrivelled away to a wraith of his former self. His cheeks, his chin, had waned

to the vanishing point. He opened his lips and mouthed horribly, yet his

frightful grimacings conveyed no meaning. Mary called to Mrs. Yellett, but her

voice was drowned in the rattle of the wagon, the clatter of four horses’

hoofs, and the continual “Hi-hi-hi-kerat! hi-kerat!” of the driver.

In the mean time Leander pointed to his mouth and back to the road in

indescribably pathetic pantomime. “Perhaps the poor creature wants to

turn back and die in his bed, like a Christian, even if he isn’t

one,” thought Mary, as she called and called, Leander still emitting the

most inhuman of cries, like the sounds made by deaf mutes in distress.

Presently Mrs. Yellett drew up, and asked in the name of many profane things

what was the matter with her companions.


Leander resumed his mouthings and his dumb show, but Mrs. Yellett proved a

better interpreter than Mary Carmichael.


“God A’mighty!” she said, “he’s lost his false

teeth!” And without another word she turned the four horses and the wagon

with a skill that fell little short of sleight-of-hand.


The dialogue that followed between Mrs. Yellett and Leander as to how far back

he had dropped his teeth, cannot be given, owing to the inadequacy of the

English language to reproduce his toothless enunciation. Catching, as Mary did,

the meaning of Mrs. Yellett’s remarks only, she received something of the

one-sided impression given by overhearing a telephone conversation:


“What did you have ’em out for?... You didn’t have ’em

out?... I just shook ’em out? Then what made you have your mouth open? Ef

your mouth had been shut, you couldn’t have lost ’em.... You was

a-yawnin’, eh? Well, you are a plumb fool to yawn on this kind of a

waggin, with your mouth full o’ china teeth. Your yawnin’ ’ll

put us back a good hour an’ we won’t reach camp before

sundown.”


At this point of the diatribe the Infidel left the wagon and began to search

along the road. He said he had noticed a buffalo skull near the place where he

had dropped the teeth, and thought he could trace them by this landmark. Mrs.

Yellett held the ribbons and suggested that Mary get down “and help to

prospect for them teeth.” As Mary clambered down she heard a fragment of

the matriarch’s monologue, which, being duly expurgated for polite ears,

was to the effect that she would rather take ten babies anywhere than one grown

man, and that as for getting in the way, hindering, obstructing, and being a

nuisance, generally speaking, man had not his counterpart in the scheme of

creation.


“Talk about a woman bein’ at the bottom of everything!”

sniffed Mrs. Yellett; “I be so sick of always hearin’ about

‘the woman in the case!’ Half the time the case would be a blame

sight worse if it was left exclusive to the men. The Book of Hiram says:

‘A skunk may have his good p’ints, but few folks is takin’

the risk of waitin’ round to get acquainted with ’em.’”


While Mary was still “prospecting,” a glad cry roused her

attention, and Leander came up smiling, with his dental treasures nicely

adjusted.


“Quit smilin’ like a rattlesnake, you plumb fool!” called out

Mrs. Yellett. “Do you want to lose ’em again?”


So, curtailing the muscular contraction indicative of his pleasure, the Infidel

again took his place among the bed-quilts and the journey was resumed.


It was now about five in the afternoon. The heat, which had been oppressive all

day, suddenly relaxed its blistering grip, and a keenly penetrating dampness,

not unlike that of a sea-fog, came from some unknown quarter of the arid wastes

and chilled the three travellers to the marrow. The horses flung up their heads

and sniffed it, rearing and plunging as if they had scent of something

menacing. Across the horizon a dark cloud scudded, no bigger than your hand.


“Cloud-burst!” announced Mrs. Yellett.


“Cloud-burst, all right enough,” agreed Leander, and he turned up

his coat-collar in simple preparation for the deluge.


There flashed into Mary Carmichael’s mind a sentence from her physical

geography that she had been obliged to commit to heart in her school-days:

“A cloud-burst is a sudden, capricious rainfall, as if the whole cloud

had been precipitated at once.” She wanted to question her companions as

to the accuracy of this definition, but before she had time to frame a sentence

the real cloud-burst came, with a splitting crack of thunder; then the

lightning flashed out its message in the short-hand of the storm, across the

inky blackness, and the water fell as if the ocean had been inverted. In the

fraction of a second all three were drenched to the skin, the water pouring

from them in sheets, as if they had been some slight obstruction in the path of

a waterfall. The wagon was soon in a deep gully, with frothing, foaming, yellow

water up to the hubs of the wheels. Mrs. Yellett, like some goddess of the

storm, lashed her horses forward to keep them from foundering in the mud, and

the wagon creaked and groaned in all its timbers as it lurched and jolted

through the angry torrents.


Each moment Mary expected to be flung from the barrels, and clung till her

finger-tips were white and aching. From the drenched red bedquilts a sticky

crimson trail ran over the barrel heads, as well as over Mary’s hands,

face, and dress. Still they forged on through the deluge, Mrs. Yellett shouting

and lashing the horses, holding them erect and safe with the skill she never

lost. The fur on her rabbit-skin cap was beaten flat. The great, wet braids had

fallen from the force of the water and hung straight and black, like huge

snakes uncoiled. She was far from losing her grip on either the horses or the

situation, and from the inspiring ring of her voice as she urged them forward

it was plain that she took a fierce joy in this conflict of the elements.


It was bitterly cold, and Mary reflected that if Leander’s teeth

chattered half as hard as hers did, without breaking, they must, indeed, be of

excellent quality. The storm began to abate, and the sky became lighter, though

the water still poured in torrents. As soon as her responsibility as driver

left her time to speak, Mrs. Yellett lost no time in fastening the cloud-burst

to Leander.


“This here is what comes of settin’ up your back against God

A’mighty and encouragin’ the heathen and the infidel in his

idolatry. I might ’a’ knowed somethin’ would happen,

takin’ you along! ‘And the heathen and the infidel went out, and

the Lord God sent a cloud-burst to wet him,’” quoted Mrs. Yellett

from the apocryphal Scriptures that never yet failed to furnish her with verse

and text.


The infidel, from his side of the wagon, began to display agitation. His jaws

worked, but he said nothing.


“You ’ain’t lost them teeth again, have you?”


He nodded his head wretchedly.


“‘And the Lord took away the teeth of his enemy, so that he could

neither bite nor talk,’” quoted Mrs. Yellett to the miserable man,

who could make no reply.


“Wonder you wouldn’t see the foolishness o’ being a heathen

and a infidel, and turn to the Lord! You ’ain’t got no teeth, and

it takes your wife to herd you. ‘And the Lord multiplied the tribulations

of his enemy.’ You got no more show standin’ up agin the Lord than

an insect would have standin’ up agin me.”


She had Leander, at last, just where she wanted him. He was forced to listen,

and he could make no reply. She alternately abused him for his lack of faith

and urged him to repentance. Leander raged, gesticulated, turned his back on

her, mouthed, and finally put his fingers in his ears. But nothing stemmed the

tide of Mrs. Yellett’s eloquence; it was as inexhaustible and as

remorseless as the cloud-burst.


It continued bitterly cold, even after the rain had stopped falling, and the

heap of sodden bedclothes furnished no protection against the chilling

dampness. It was growing dark; there was no red in the sunset, only a streak of

vivid orange along the horizon, chill and clear as the empty, soulless flame of

burning paper. There were no deep, glowing coals, no amethystine opalescence,

fading into gold and violet. All was cold and subdued, and the scrub pines on

the mountain-tops stood out sharply against this cold background like an

etching on yellow paper.


Mrs. Yellett’s self-inspired scriptural maxims were discontinued after a

while, either because she could think of no more, or because the rain-soaked,

shivering, chattering object towards which they were directed was too abject to

inspire further efforts. Leander huddled on the barrel that was farthest from

Mrs. Yellett, and wrapped himself in the soaked red bedquilt. The dye smeared

his face till he looked like an Indian brave ready for battle, but there was no

further suggestion of the fighting red man in the utter desolation of his

attitude. Mary Carmichael, on her barrel, shivered with grim patience and

longed for a cup of tea. Only Mrs. Yellett gave no sign of anxiety or

discomfort; she drove along, sometimes whistling, sometimes swearing, erect as

an Indian, and to all appearances as oblivious of cold and wet as if she were

in her own home.


The gathering darkness into which the horses were plunging was mysterious and

appalling. Objects stood out enormously magnified, or distorted grotesquely, in

the uncertain light. It was like penetrating into the real Inferno, like

stumbling across the inspiration of Dante in all its sinister splendor. It was

the Inferno of his dream rather than the Inferno of his poem; it had the

ghastly reality of the unreal.


“It wouldn’t surprise me if we had a smash-up in Clear

Creek,” said Mrs. Yellett, just by way of adding her quota of cheerful

speculation. She ducked her head and whispered in Mary’s ear:


“It’s all along of me hirin’ him! I wouldn’t be

surprised if paw died. I’m thinkin’ of shakin’ him out after

his teeth. ‘Take not up with the enemy of the Lord, lest he make of you

also an enemy.’”


But there was no accent of apprehension in Mrs. Yellett’s dismal

prognostications of the evil that might befall her for employing Leander. She

spoke more with the air of one who produces incidents to prove an argument than

of one who anticipates a calamity.


Leander, toothless and wretched, sitting on the side of the wagon, began to

show symptoms of joy comparable to that of the vanguard of the Israelites,

catching their first glimpse of the Promised Land. Touching Mary Carmichael on

the shoulder, he pointed to a white tent and the remains of a camp-fire.

Already Mrs. Yellett had begun to “Hallo, Ben!” But Ben was at work

at the vat, which was still a quarter of a mile further up the mountain; so

Mrs. Yellett, throwing the reins to Leander and bidding him turn out the

horses, lost no time in building a fire, putting on coffee, and making her

little party comfortable. So various was her efficiency that she seemed no less

at home in these simple domestic tasks than when guiding her horses,

goddess-like, through the cloud-burst. And Mary Carmichael, succumbing

gradually to the revivifying influence of the fire and the hot coffee,

acknowledged honestly to herself a warmth of affection for her hostess and for

the atmosphere Mrs. Yellett created about her that made even Virginia and her

aunts seem less the only pivot of rational existence. She felt that she had

come West with but one eye, as it were, and countless prejudices, whereas her

powers of vision were fast becoming increased a hundredfold. How very tame life

must be, she reflected, as she sat smiling to herself, to those who did not

know Mrs. Yellett, how over-serious to those who did not know Leander! Yet,

after all, she knew that the real basis of her readjusted vision was her brief

but illuminating acquaintance with Judith Rodney. To Mary, freed for the first

time in her life from the most elegantly provincial of surroundings, Judith

seemed the incarnation of all the splendor and heroism of the West. And in the

glow of her enthusiasm she decided then and there not to abandon the Yellett

educational problem till she should have solved it successfully. She might not

be born to valiant achievement, like these sturdy folk about her, but she might

as well prove to them that an Eastern tenderfoot was not all feebleness and

inefficiency.


“Leander!” called Mrs. Yellett. “Just act as if you was to

home and wash up these dishes.”


XVIII.

Foreshadowed


Alida awoke, knowing what was to happen. She had dreamed of it, just before

daylight, and lay in bed stupefied by the horror of it, living, again and

again, through each frightful detail. It had happened—there, in the very

room, and before the children; the noise of it had startled them; and then she

woke and knew she had been dreaming. In the dream the noise had wakened the

children—when it really happened they must never know. It wouldn’t

be fair to them; they needed a “clean start.”


What had she done to keep them quiet? There had been a thunderous knocking at

the door. She had expected it and was prepared; because the lock was feeble,

she had shoved the old brown bureau against the door.


Nothing had happened. What a fool she was to lie there and think of it! There

was the brown bureau against the wall; she could hear the deep breathing of Jim

in the room beyond. Jim had been unequal to the task of conventionally going to

bed the night before, and she had put a pillow under his head and a quilt over

him. She was the last woman in the world to worry about Jim, drunk, or to nag

him for it when sober. But she didn’t like the children to see him that

way.


What was it that she had done to quiet the children when “they”

rode up? She had done something and they had gone to sleep again, and

she—and she—oh no, it hadn’t happened. What a fool she was to

lie there thinking! There were the children to rouse and dress, and breakfast

to cook, and Jim—Jim would be feeling pretty mean this morning;

he’d like a good cup of coffee. She was glad he was alive to make coffee

for.


She got up and, in the uncertainty bred of the dream, felt the brown bureau,

felt it hungrily, almost incredulously. The brown bureau had been pushed

against the door when they had come, and knocked and knocked. Then they had

thundered with the butts of their six-shooters, and the children had wakened,

and she had called out to them:


“Sh-sh! It’s only a bad dream. Mammy will give you some dough to

bake to-morrow.”


And she had gone to press her face flat to the thin wall, and call, “For

God’s sake, don’t wake the children!”


And they had called out, “Let him come out quiet, then.”


And then she could feel that they put their shoulders to the door—the

weather-beaten door—with its crazy lock that didn’t half catch. The

brown bureau had spun across the floor like a top, and they had crowded in.

Then she had done something to quiet the children—it was queer that she

could not remember what it was, when everything else in the dream still lived

within her, horribly distinct and real.


What a fool she was, with Jim asleep in the next room; she would not think

about it another minute. She began to dress, but her fingers were heavy, and

the vague oppression of nightmare blocked her efficiency. Repeatedly she would

detect herself subconsciously brooding over some one of the links in that

pitiless memory—what they had said to Jim; his undaunted replies; how she

had left him and gone into the next room because Jim had told her to.


She called the children, but the sight of them, happy and flushed with sleep,

did not reassure her.


“Mammy,” said Topeka, eldest of the family, and lately on the

invalid list, the victim of a cactus thorn, “my toe’s all well; can

I go barefoot?”


“Topeka Rodney, what kind of feet do you expect to have when you are a

young lady, if you run barefoot now?”


Topeka, sitting on the side of the bed, with tousled hair, put her small feet

together and contemplated them. The toe was still suspiciously inflamed for

perfect convalescence, although Topeka, with a Spartan courage that won her a

place in the annals of household valor, had the day before allowed her mother

to pick out with a needle the torturing cactus thorn, scorning to shed a tear

during the operation, though afterwards she had taken the piece of dried apple

that was offered her and devoured it to the last bite, as only just

compensation for her sufferings.


“Dimmy dot a tore toe, too.” But Jimmy showed a strange reticence

about offering proofs of his affliction. At the peril of his equilibrium, he

clasped the allegedly injured member in his chubby hand and rolled over on the

bed in apparent anguish.


“Less see, Jimmy,” asked his mother, anxiously.


“Don’t bleeve him, mammy. He ’ain’t ever cried.

He’d a cried, for sure, if his toe was sore.” At the age of five,

little Judith, namesake of her aunt, was something of a doubting Thomas.


“Let mammy see, Jimmy,” and Alida bent over her son and heir.


“Doth Dimmy det any apple?” The wee man sometimes succeeded in

making terms with his mother, when the other children were not present. Though

feeling himself a trifle over-confident, he held the disputed toe with the air

of one keeping back a trump card, and looked his mother squarely in the eyes.


She struggled with the temptation to give him the apple. He had lifted the

horrors of her dream as nothing else could have done, but she answered him with

quiet firmness.


“Jimmy must not tell stories.”


“Less see,” insisted Topeka.


“He dassent,” affirmed Judith, junior, of little faith.


“It hurths me,” and Jimmy tried to squeeze out a tear. “It

hurths me, my tore toe!”


His mother tipped him over on his fat little back and opened the chubby hand

that held the trump toe. It was white from the pressure applied by the infant

dissembler, but there was no trace of the treacherous cactus thorn. She gave

him an affectionate spank and went into the kitchen to make coffee.


“I with I had a tore toe,” he crooned, quite unabashed at the

discovery of his deception. “I with I toud det a tore toe ’thout

the hurt.”


But the horror of the dream gripped her when she found herself alone in the

kitchen; and she remembered she had not told the children not to go into the

room where their father was sleeping. She went back and found that Jimmy had

not left his post on the side of the bed, where he still regretted that his

perfectly well toe did not entitle him to gastronomic consideration. Topeka,

who had arrived at an age where little girls, in the first subconscious attempt

at adornment, know no keener delight than plastering their heads with a wet

hairbrush, till they present an appearance of slippery rotundity equalled only

by a peeled onion, put down the brush with guilty haste at sight of her mother.


“I’m goin’ to dress him soon as I’ve done my

hair.”


“Any one think you was goin’ to be married, the time you’ve

took to it.”


“It’s gettin’ so long,” urged Topeka.


“I wouldn’t give it a chance to grow no longer while Jimmy was

waitin’ to get dressed. And don’t go into the front room. Your

father’s gettin’ his sleep out.”


Topeka opened her round eyes. There was always something suspicious about that

sleep her father had to get out, but she felt it was something she must not ask

questions about. Her mother lingered; she dreaded to be alone in the kitchen.

The little, familiar intimacies between herself and her children scattered the

horrors of the dream which would come back to her when she was again at the

mercy of her thoughts.


“Judy, s’pose you dress Jimmy this morning! I want Topeka to help

me get breakfast.”


“Yessum,” said Judith, dutifully. “Is he to have his face

washed?”


“He certainly is, Judy. I’s ashamed to have you ask such a

question. ’Ain’t you all been brought up to have your faces

washed?”


But young Judith seemed disinclined to take up this phase of family

superiority. She merely inquired further:


“Is he to have it washed with soap, maw?”


“He shore is. Any one would think you had been born and raised in Arizony

or Nebrasky, to hear you talk. I’m plumb ashamed of you, Judy.”


“But, ’deed, maw, I ain’t big enough to wash his face with

soap. It takes Topeka to hold his head.”


The subject of the discussion still sat on the edge of the bed, a small lord of

creation, letting his women folk arrange among themselves who should minister

to his wants. As an instrument of torture the washcloth, in the hands of his

sister Judy, was no ignoble rival of the cactus thorn. The question of making

terms for his sufferings again appealed to him in the light of a feasible

business proposition.


“Muvvy, tan’t I have the apple? Judy hurts me a lot when she wathes

my face wis soap.”


“Yes, you can have the apple, honey; and, Judy, you be gentle with him.

Don’t rub his features up, and be careful and don’t get soap in his

eyes.”


“No’m.” And Judy heroically stifled the longing to slick her

hair, like Topeka’s, with the wet hairbrush. There were easier tasks than

washing the face of her younger brother.


When Topeka and her mother were alone in the kitchen, Topeka grinding the

coffee and all unconsciously working her jaw in an accompaniment to the

coffee-mill, her mother bent over her and said:


“Did you dream of anything last night?”


Topeka simultaneously stopped working the coffee-mill and her jaw, and regarded

her mother solemnly. She did not remember having been thus questioned about her

dreams before.


“No’m,” she answered, after laborious consideration. But

something in her mother’s face held her.


“You’re sure you didn’t dream nothing?”


“Yes, maw.”


“Did Judy or Jim say that they dreamed anything?”


“Jim said he dreamed he had a pup.”


“Was that all? Think hard, Topeka!”


Topeka held the handle of the coffee-mill in her hand; her jaw continued to

work with the labor of her mental process. “I’ve thought hard, maw,

and all he told was about the pup.”


Alida went back to her bedroom and again felt the brown bureau.

“What’s the matter with me, anyhow? It’s the lonesomeness,

and they bein’ agin Jim the way they are. God, this country’s hard

on women and horses!”


When breakfast was over, and young Jim had received the reward of his valor in

presenting a brave face to his ablution, and Judith the reward of her skill,

the evidence of which almost prevented the young martyr from smiling while he

enjoyed his treat, their mother sent them all to play in the cañon. She told

them not to come home till she should come for them, and if any one should ask

about their father, to say that he was away from home. And this, as well as the

mystery of her father’s “getting his sleep out,” roused some

slight apprehension in Topeka, who was old for her age. They were seldom sent

to the cañon to play. Topeka looked at her mother as she had when questioned

about the dream, but there was no further confidence between them.


“You do as your sister Topeka tells you, and remember what I said about

your papa,” Alida said to the younger children. Jim and Judy clasped each

other’s hands in mute compact at the edict. Their sister Topeka had a

real genius for authority; they were minded all too well when she swayed the

maternal sceptre vicariously.


Alida made fresh coffee for Jim when the children had gone. She made it

carefully; there was this morning, unconsciously, about each little thing that

she did for him, the solemnity of a funeral rite. Struggle as she would, she

could not divest her mind of the conviction that what she did this day she did

for the dead. She would go to the door and listen to his breathing, and tell

herself that she was a fool, then wring her hands at the remembrance of the

dream.


As he tossed, half waking, she heard him groan and curse the cattle-men with

oaths that made her glad she had sent the children from home. Then she bent

over him and woke him from his uneasy slumber.


“Jim, don’t you want me to bathe your head? And here’s some

nice, hot coffee all ready for you.”


Jim woke slowly to a realization of his troubles and his blessings. His wife

was bathing his head with hands that trembled. Not always had she greeted his

indiscretions with such loving forbearance. He noticed, though his waking

faculties were not over-keen, that her face was pale and frightened, and that

her eyes, meeting his, held a dumb, measureless affection.


“What th’ hell are you babying me for?” But his roughness did

not deceive her woman’s wits. He was not getting the lecture he

anticipated, and this was his way of showing that he was not embarrassed by her

kindness. The morning sunlight was pitilessly frank in its exposure of the grim

pinch of poverty in the mean little room, but the woman was unconscious of

these things; what she saw was that Jim, the reckless, Jim, the dare-devil

terror of the country, Jim, who had married and settled with her into

home-keeping respectability, Jim, who had struggled with misfortune and fallen,

had, young as he was, lost every look of youth; that hope had gone from his

dull eyes, and that his face had become drawn until the death’s-head

grinned beneath the scant padding of flesh. But he was to-day, as always, the

one man in the world for her. In making a world of their own and reducing their

parents to supplementary consideration, their children, whom she had sent away

that she might be alone with him, had given a different quality to the love of

this pair that had known so many curious vicissitudes. The responsibilities of

parenthood had placed them on a tenderer, as well as a securer footing; and as

she saw his age and weariness, he recognized hers, and both felt a

self-accusing twinge.


“That’s a blamed good cup of coffee,” he said, by way of

relieving the tension that had crept into the situation. “Any one would

think you was settin’ your cap for me ’stead of us being married

for years.”


Alida sighed. “It’s better to end than to begin like this,”

she said, in the far-away voice of one who thinks aloud. The word

“end” had slipped out before she realized what she was saying, and

the knowledge haunted her as an omen. She glanced at him quickly, to see if he

had noticed it.


“Why did you say end?” He saw that her eyes were full of tears and

chafed her. “You ain’t thinking of divorcing me, like Mountain Pink

done Bosky?”


“Oh, Jim,” she said, and her face was all aquiver, “I never

could divorce you, no matter what you done.” And then the grim philosophy

of the plains-woman asserted itself. “I never can understand why women

feed their pride on their heart’s blood; it never was my way.”


He did not like to remember that he had given her cause for a way.

“There’s a lot of women as wouldn’t exactly regard me as a

Merino, or a Southdown, either;” he gulped the coffee to ease the

tightness in his throat.


“They’d be women of no judgment, then,” she said, with

conviction.


Jim’s head was tilted back, resting in the palm of his hand. His profile,

sharpened by anxiety, more than suggested his quarter-strain of Sioux blood. He

might almost have been old Chief Flying Hawk himself, as he looked steadily at

the woman who had been a young girl and reckless, when he had been a boy and

reckless; who had paid her woman’s penalty and come into her

woman’s kingdom; who had made a man of him by the mystery of her

motherhood, and who had uncomplainingly gone with him into the wilderness and

become an alien and an outcast.


These things unmanned him as the sight of the gallows and the rope for his

hanging could not have done. Shielding himself with an affected roughness, he

asked:


“What the hell’s the matter with you? I’ve been drinking like

a beast of an Indian, and you give me coffee instead of a

tongue-lashing.”


The color had all gone out of her face. She gasped the words:


“Jim, I dreamed it last night—they came for you!”


She cowered at the recollection.


“Did they get me?” he asked. There was no surprise in his tone. He

spoke as one who knew the answer.


“Yes, the children saw. The noise woke them.”


“You mustn’t let ’em see, when—they come. They’ve

a right to a fair start; we didn’t get it, old girl.”


“The children gave it to us,” and she faced him.


“Yes, yes, but we want them to have it from the start, like good

folks.”


They looked into each other’s eyes. The memory of dead and gone madness

twinkled there a moment, then each remembered:


“You must hurry, Jim. You haven’t a moment to lose. I dreamed it

was to be to-night—they’ll come to-night!”


“The game’s all up, old girl! If I had a month I couldn’t get

away. Morrison’s been looking for me over to the Owl Creek Range;

he’s back—Stevens told me yesterday. He’ll be heading here

soon. The price on my head is a strain on friendship.”


“Have the sheep-men gone back on you?”


“Yes, damn them! A thousand dollars is big money, and they’ve had

hard luck!”


“They deserve it; I hope every herd in the State dies of scab.”


“There wasn’t a scabby sheep in our bunch. What a sight they were,

loaded with tallow! There wasn’t one of them that couldn’t have

weathered a blizzard; they could have lived on their own tallow for a

month.”


She tried to divert his attention from his lost flock. When he began to talk

about them the despair of his loss drove him to drink. She was ground between

the millstones of his going or staying. If he stayed they would come for him;

if he went, they would apprehend him before he was ten miles from the house.


“Jim, we got to think. If there’s a chance in a thousand that you

can get away, you got to take it; if there ain’t, the children

mustn’t know. We got to think it out!”


“There ain’t a chance in a thousand, old girl. There ain’t

one in a million. They’re circling round in the hills out here now,

waitin’ for me, like buzzards waitin’ for the eyes of a dyin’

horse.”


She rocked herself, and the clutching fingers left white marks on her face, but

the eyes that met his glittered tearless:


“Then there ain’t nothing left but to face it like a man?”


“That’s all there be.” He might have been giving an opinion

on a matter in which he had no interest.


“Then there ain’t no use in our having any more talk about

it?”


“’Tain’t just what you’d call an agreeable

subject,” he answered, with the sinister humor of the frontiersman who

has learned to make a crony of death.


She was tempted to kiss him—they were not given to demonstrations, this

pair—then decided it were kinder to him, less suggestive of what they

anticipated, not to deviate from their undemonstrative marital routine.


“Do you want your breakfast now?”


“I guess you might bring it along.”


And for the same reason that she refrained from kissing him, she repressed a

desire to wring the neck of a young broiler and cook it for his breakfast,

remembering that she had heard they gave folks pretty much what they wanted

when they wouldn’t want it long. So Jim got his usual breakfast of bacon,

uncooked canned tomatoes, soda-biscuit, and coffee. She sat with him while he

ate, but they spoke no more of “them” or of how soon

“they” might be expected. She told him that young Jim had pretended

that morning that he had a cactus thorn in his foot, so that he might have a

piece of dried apple. And old Jim, in an excess of parental fondness and pride,

said: “The damned little liar, he’ll get to Congress yet!”


But the children were a dangerous topic for overstrained nerves at this

particular time, so Alida told Jim that she had put the black hen to set and

she thought they’d have some chickens at last. Jim smoked while Alida

washed the dishes, and when Jim’s back was turned she examined the lock

on the door—a good push would open it. Then she looked at the brown

bureau, and the recklessness of despair came into her eyes. In the room beyond,

Jim was reading a two weeks’ old newspaper and smoking. He looked like a

lazy ranchman taking his ease.


As she went about her household tasks that morning, Alida noticed things as she

had never noticed them before. A sunbeam came through the shutterless window of

the house and writhed and quivered on the wall as if it were a live thing. She

read a warning in this, and in the color of the sun, that was red, like blood,

and in the whirr of the grasshoppers, that was sinister and threatening. The

creeks had dried, and their slimy beds crept along the willows like sluggish

snakes. Gaunt range-cattle bellowed in their thirst, and the parched earth

crackled beneath the sun that hung above the house like a flaming disk.

Sometimes she sank beneath the burden of it; then she would wring her hands and

call on God to help them; they were beyond human power. She and Jim were alone

all the morning; they did not again refer to what they knew would happen. He

read his old paper and she put her house in order. She did it with especial

care. It was meet to have things seemly in the house of the dead. And every

time she glanced at Jim she repressed the desire to fling herself on his breast

and cry out the anguish that consumed her.


At noon she brought the children home to dinner, and afterwards Jim taught them

to throw the lasso and played buffalo with them. Alida did not trust herself to

watch them; she stayed in the kitchen and saw the sunbeam grow pale with the

waning of the day, the day whose minutes dragged like lead, yet had rushed from

her, leaving her the night to face. At sundown she cooked supper, but she no

longer knew what she did. A crazy agility had taken possession of her and she

spun about the kitchen, doing the same errand many times, finding herself doing

always something different from that she had set about doing. The molten day

was burning itself out like a fever; hot gusts of air beat up from the earth,

but the woman who waited felt chilled to the marrow, and took a cloak down from

a peg and wrapped it about her while she waited for the biscuit to bake. At

supper they sat down together, the man and his wife and their three children.

The children were in fine spirits from the fun they had had that afternoon.

Never had daddy been so nice to them. He had taught Topeka to throw the lasso

so well that she had caught the cat once and little Jim twice; and daddy had

played he was a buffalo and had charged them all with his head down, till they

screamed in terror. But daddy seemed more quiet through the meal, and once

mother started up and cried:


“What’s that?”


She ran to the door with her hand pressed to her side, but daddy called after

her:


“Don’t you know the cowards better than that? They’ll wait

for nightfall.”


But these things had not worried the children, with their heads full of playing

buffalo and throwing the lariat.


“Jim,” said his father, before they went to bed, “remember

you are the man of the family.” But young Jim was already nodding with

sleep. Topeka and Judith were sleepy, too; they kissed their father and were

glad to go to bed.


The night began menacingly to close over the wilderness. Where the sun had hung

above the mountain a moment before there glowed a great pool of red that

dripped across the blackness in faint tricklings. The outlines of the

foot-hills loomed huge, formless, uncouth. In the half-light it seemed a world

struggling in the birth-throes. All day the dry, burning heat had quivered over

the desert, like hot-air waves flickering over a bed of live coals, and now the

very earth seemed to palpitate with the intensity of its fever. The bellowing

of the thirst-maddened cattle had not stopped with the twilight that brought no

dew to slake their parched throats. In the hills the coyotes wailed like lost

souls. It was night bereft of benisons, day made frightful by darkness. All the

heat of a cycle of desert summers seemed concentrated in that house in the

valley where the man and his wife waited. Each sound of the desert night Alida

translated into the trampling of horses’ feet; then, as the sound would

die away, or prove to be but some night noise of the wilderness, the pallor

would lose its pinch on her features, and she would stare into her

husband’s face with eyes that did not see. Jim smoked his pipe and

refilled it, smoked and filled again, but gave no sign of the object of his

waiting.


“Jim,” she said, when the clock had struck ten, then eleven,

“I am going to fasten up the house.”


“Do you hear them?” he asked, without emotion, but as one who

deferred to the finer senses of women.


She shook her head, not trusting herself to speak.


He looked at the door that was shrunken and warped from the heat till it barely

held together, and there was no measure to the tenderness he put into:


“Oh, you poor little fool, do you think you could keep them out by

fastening that?”


“Jim, I must,” and her voice broke. “They may think you are

not here, that it’s only me and the children, and that’s why the

house is fastened.” She got up and began to move about as though her

thoughts scourged her to action, even if futile. He shook the ashes from his

pipe.


“Do anything you blame please,” he said, more by way of humoring

her than from faith in her stratagem. He felt strong enough to face his

destiny, to meet it in a way worthy of his mother’s people.


Alida seemed under a spell in her preparations for the night. Each thing she

did as she had done it in her dream the night before; it was as if she were

constrained by a power greater than her will to fulfil a sinister prophecy. Yet

now and then she would stop and wonder if she might not break the spell by

doing things differently from the way she had dreamed them. Her hand grasped

the knob of the door uncertainly, and she swung it to and fro on its creaking

hinges, while her mind seemed likewise to sway hither and thither. Should she

fasten the door and push the bureau against it, as it had been in the dream, or

should she leave door and windows gaping wide for them? And then, as one who

walks and does familiar things in sleep, she shut the door and turned the key.

Jim smiled at her, but she could no longer look at him. One of the children

wailed fretfully from the room beyond. Sleep had become a scourge in the

stifling heat. One by one she lowered the windows and nailed them down; then

she dragged the brown bureau against the door, took the brace of six-shooters

from the wall, and sat down with Jim to wait.


“What are you going to do with them toys?” he asked, as he saw her

examine the chambers of one of the six-shooters.


“You ain’t going to let yourself be caught like a rat in a hole,

are you?” she reproached him.


“’Ain’t we agreed that it’s best to keep onpleasant

family matters from the kids?” He smiled at her bravely. “The

remembrance of what we’re anticipatin’ ain’t going to help

young Jim to get to Congress when his time comes, nor it ain’t going to

help the girls get good husbands, either. This here country ain’t what it

was in the way of liberality since it’s got to be a State.”


“Sh-sh-sh!” she said. “Is that the range-cattle

stampedin’ after water, or is it—” They listened. The

furniture in the room crackled; there was not a fibre of it to which the

resistless heat had not penetrated. On the range the cattle bellowed in their

thirst-torture; in the intervals of their cries sounded something far off, but

regular as the thumping of a ship’s screw. The woman did not need an

answer to her question. The steady trampling of hoofs came muffled through the

dead air, but the sound was unmistakable. She put her arms about the

man’s neck and crushed him to her with all her woman strength. “Oh,

Jim, you’ve been a good man to me!”


“Steady—steady.” He strained her close to him.

“They’d be, by the sound of them, on the straight bit of road now,

before the turn. Soon we’ll hear their hoofs ring hollow as they cross

the plank bridge.”


His plainsman’s faculty was as keen as ever; his calculation of the

horsemen’s distance was made as though he were the least concerned. All

Alida’s courage had gone, with the dread thing at hand. She clung to him,

dazed.


“They’re sober, all right enough.”


“How do you know?”


“They’d be cursing and bellowing if they were drunk.”


The hoofs rang hollow on the little plank bridge that crossed the ditch about a

stone’s-throw from the door. Not a word was said either within or

without. The lynchers seemed to have drilled for their part; there was no

whispering, no deferring to a leader. On they came, so close that Jim and Alida

could hear the creaking of their saddles. There was the clank of spurs and the

straining of leather as they dismounted, then some one knocked at the door till

the warped boards rattled.


Jim could feel the thudding of Alida’s heart as she clung to him, but

when the knock was repeated a new courage came to her, and she left Jim and

went on her knees close to the outer wall.


“Jim, is that you?” she called, and now every sense was trained to

battle; her voice had even a sleepy cadence, as if she had been suddenly

roused.


“That won’t do at all, Miz Rodney. We know you got Jim in there,

just as certain as we’re out here, and we want him to come out and

we’ll do the thing square, otherwise he can take the consequences.”


Jim opened his mouth to speak, but she, still on her knees beside the wall,

gained his silence by one supplicating gesture. There was a sleepy, fretful cry

from the room beyond—the noise had roused one of the children.


“Sh-sh, dear,” she called. “It’s only a bad dream. Go

to sleep again; mother is here.”


Through the warped door came sounds of the whispering voices without, drowned

by the shrieking bellow of the cattle. There was not a breath of air in the

suffocating room. Jim bent towards Alida:


“I’m goin out to ’em. They’ll do it square, over on the

cotton-woods; this rumpus’ll only wake the kids.”


But she shook her head imploringly, putting her finger to her lips as a sign

that he was not to speak, and he had not the heart to refuse, though knowing

that she made a desperate situation worse.


“Gentlemen”—she spoke in a low, distinct

voice—“Jim ain’t here. He’s been away from home five

days. There’s no one here but me and the children; you’ve woke them

up and frightened them by pounding on the door. I ask you to go away.”


“If he ain’t in there, will you let us search the house?” It

was Henderson that spoke, Henderson, foreman of the “XXX” outfit.


“I can’t have them frightened; please take my word and go

away.”


“Whas er matter, muvvy?” called Judith, sleepily. Young Jim was by

this time crying lustily. Only Topeka said nothing. With the precocity of a

frontier child, she half realized the truth. She tried to comfort little Jim,

though her teeth chattered in fear and she felt cold in the hot, still room.

Then Judith called out, “Make papa send them away.”


“Your papa ain’t here, Judith.” But the fight had all gone

out of Alida’s voice; it was the groan of an animal in a trap.


“Where’s papa gone to?”


“Sh-sh, Judith! Topeka, keep your sister quiet.”


It was absolutely still, within and without, for a full minute. Then Alida

heard the shoving of shoulders against the door. Once, twice, thrice the lock

resisted them. The brown bureau spun across the room like a child’s toy.

The lynchers, bursting in, saw Alida with her arms around Jim. When the last

hope had gone it was instinct with her to protect him with her own body.


“Go into the kids, old girl, this is no place for you.” And there

was that in his voice that made her obey.


Something of the glory of old Chief Flying Hawk, riding to battle, was in the

face of his grandson.


“Remember, the children ain’t to know,” he said to his wife;

and to the lynchers, “Gentlemen, I’m ready.”


XIX.

“Rocked By A Hempen String”


Alida heard the mingled sounds of footsteps and hoofs grow fainter on the

trail. The children looked at her to tell them why this night was different

from all others—what was happening. But she could only cower among them,

more terrified than they. She seemed to be shrunken from the happenings of that

day. They hardly knew the little, shrivelled, gray woman who looked at them

with unfamiliar eyes. Alida gazed at the little Judith, and there was something

in her mother’s glance that made the little one hide her face in her

sister’s shoulder. Young Judith it was who all unwittingly had told the

lynchers that her father was at home, and in Alida’s heart there was

towards this child a blind, unreasoning hate. Better had she never been born

than live to do this thing!


It was the wee man, Jim, who first began to reflect resentfully on this

intrusion on his slumbers. He had been sleeping well and comfortably when some

grown-ups came with a lot of noise, and his father had gone away with them. It

had frightened him, but his mother was here, and why should she not put him to

sleep again?


“Muvvy, sing ‘Dway Wolf.’” And as she paid no heed, but

looked at him, white-faced and strange, he again repeated, with his most

insinuating and beguiling tricks of eye and smile:


“Muvvy, sing ‘Dway Wolf’ for Dimmy.”


The child put his head in his mother’s lap, and Alida began, scarce

knowing what she did:


“‘The gray wolves are coming fast over the hill,

    Run fast, little lamb, do not baa, do not bleat,

For the gray wolves are hungry, they come here to kill,

    And the lambs shall be scattered—’


No, no, Jimmy, muvvy cannot sing. Oh, can’t you feel, child? Judith,

Judith, why were you ever born?”


It was still in the valley. Had they come to the dead cotton-woods yet? Had

they begun it? The children shrank from this gray-faced woman whom they did not

know and but yet a little while had been their mother. An awful silence had

fallen on the night. The range-cattle no longer bellowed in their thirst; the

hot wind no longer blew from the desert. A hush not of earth nor air nor the

things that were of her ken seemed to have fallen about them, muffing the dark

loneliness as by invisible flakes. The children had crouched close together for

comfort. They feared the little, gray-faced woman who seemed to have stolen

into their mother’s place and looked at them with strange eyes.


Jimmy looked at the woman who held him, hoping his mother would come, and he

could see them both. And while he waited he dropped off to sleep; and little

Judith, hiding her head on Topeka’s shoulder, that she might not see the

look in those accusing eyes, presently dreamed that all was well with her

again; and Topeka reflected that if her mother should ask her in the morning

whether she had dreamed last night, she would have a fine tale to tell of men

riding up, and loud voices, and trying of the door, and father going away with

them. Her mother had questioned her this morning when nothing had happened to

warrant it. Surely she would ask again to-morrow, and Topeka could

tell—she could tell—all.


Alida looked at her three sleeping children—his children, and yet they

could sleep. Into her mind came that cry of utter desolation, “Could ye

not watch with me one hour?” And God had been deaf to Him, His son, even

as He was deaf to her.


The children were sleeping easily. The hush that had hung like a pall over the

valley had not lifted. Had they done it? Was it over yet? She went to the door

and listened. Surely the silence that wrapped the valley was a thing apart. It

was as no other silence that she could remember. It was still, still, and yet

there was vibration to it, like the muffled roar within a shell. She strained

her ears—was that the sound of horsemen going down the trail? No, no, it

was only the beating of her foolish heart that would not be still, but beat and

fluttered and would not let her hear. Yes, surely, that was the sound of hoofs.

It was over then—they were going.


She would go and look for him. Perhaps it would not be too late—she had

heard of such things. A dynamic force consumed her. She had no consciousness of

her body. Her feet and hands did things with incredible swiftness—lighted

a lantern, selected a knife, ran to the corral for an old ladder that had been

there when they took possession of the deserted house; and through all her

frantic haste she could feel this new force, as it were, lick up the red blood

in her veins, burn her body to ashes as it gave her new power. She felt that

never again would she have need of meat and drink and sleep. This force would

abide with her till all was over, then leave her, like the whitened bones of

the desert.


It was dark in the valley, but the menacing stillness seemed to be lifting. The

range-cattle had again taken up their plaint, the sounds of the desert night

swept across the stony walls of the cañon. Alida knew that it must have

happened at the dead cotton-woods. There were no other high trees about for

miles. Again she listened before advancing. There was no sound of hoof or

champing bit or men moving quickly. They had gone their way into the valley.

She ran swiftly, her lantern throwing its beam across the scrubby inequalities

of ground, but for her there was no need of its beacon. To-night she was beyond

the halting, stumbling uncertainties of tread to which man is subject. There

was magic in her feet and in her hands and brain. Like the wind she ran, the

wind on the great plain where there are no foot-hills to hinder its course. The

black, dead trees stood out distinctly against the starry sky, and from a

cross-limb of one of them dangled something with head awry, like a broken

jumping-jack, something that had once been a man—and her husband. She

could touch the feet of this frightful thing and feel its human warmth. A wind

came up from the desert and blew across the cañon’s rocky walls into the

valley, and the parody of a man swayed to it.


She had been expecting this thing. For weeks the image of it had been graven on

her heart. Sleeping or waking, she had seen nothing but his dangling body from

the cross-limb. Yet with the actual consummation before her, she felt its

hideous novelty as though it were unexpected. At sight of it the force that had

borne her up through the happenings of that day went out of her, and as she

stood with the knife and the rope, that she had brought in the hope of cheating

the lynchers, dangling from her nerveless hand her helplessness overcame her.

Again and again she called to the dead man for help, called to him as she had

been accustomed to call when her woman’s strength had been unequal to

some heavy household task.


Far down the trail she could hear the gallop of a horse coming closer, and

mingled with the sounds of its flying feet was a voice urging the horse to

greater speed in the shrill cabalistic “Hi-hi-hi-ki!” of the

plains-man. What was it—one of them returning to see that she did not

cheat the rope of its due?—to hang her beside him, as an after-thought,

as they hanged Kate Watson beside her man? Let them. She was standing near the

swaying thing when horse and rider gained the ground beside her, and what was

left to her of consciousness made out that the rider was Judith. She pointed to

it, and stood helpless with the dangling rope in her hand.


“Are we too late?” Judith almost whispered, as she caught

Alida’s cold, inert hands. “I dreamed it all and came. If I could

have dreamed it sooner!”


Alida did not seem to hear, neither could she speak. She only pointed again to

the thing beside her.


Judith understood. The women had a task to share, and in silence they began it.

The lynchers had done their work all too well. Again and again the women strove

with all their strength to take down the dangling parody of a man, which in its

dead-weight resistance seemed in league with the forces against them. At last

the thing was done. Down to a pale world, that in the haggard gray of morning

seemed to bear in its countenance something of the pinch of death, Judith

lowered the thing that had so lately been a man. She cut the rope away from the

neck, she straightened the wry neck that seemed to wag in pantomimic

representation of the last word to the lynchers. They’d have to reckon

with him on dark nights, and when the wind wailed like a famished wolf and when

things not to be explained lurked in the shadows of the desert.


The morning stillness came flooding into the cup-shaped valley like a soft,

resistless wave. Something had come to the gray, old earth—another day,

with all its human gift of joy and woe, and the earth welcomed it though it had

known so many. The sun burst through the gold-tipped aureole of cloud,

scattering far and wide lavish promises of a perfect day. The earth seemed to

respond with a thrill. No longer was the pinch of death in her countenance. The

valley, the mountains, the invisible wind, even the dead cotton-woods, seemed

endowed with throbbing life that contrasted fearsomely with the terrible

nullity of this thing that once had been Jim Rodney.


Alida had ceased to take any part in the hideous drama. She sat on the ground,

a crouching thing with glittering eyes. It was past comprehension that the sun

could shine and the world go on with her man dead before her. Judith had become

the force that planned and did to save the family pride. While her hands were

busy with preparations for the dead, she rehearsed what she would say to this

and that one to account for Jim’s absence. The silence of the men who had

done this thing would be as steadfast as their own.


And there were the children. Through all her frantic search for things in the

house, Judith remembered that she must step softly and not waken the children.

With each turn of the screw, as her numbed consciousness rallied and responded

afresh to the hideous realization of this thing, there came no release from the

tyrannous hold of petty detail. She remembered that she must be back at noon to

hold post-office, and there would be the endless comedy to be played once more

with her cavaliers. They must never suspect from word or look of hers. And

there was the dance to-night at the Benton ranch—she hid her face in her

hands. Ah, no, she could not do this thing! And yet they must not suspect. She

must contrive to give the impression that Jim had cheated the rope. Yes, she

must go and dance, and, if need be, dance with his very murderers. Jim’s

children were to have the “clean start” that he intended, and they

would have to get it here. There was no money for an exodus and a beginning

elsewhere.


Alida still crouched beside the long, even tarpaulin roll that Judith had

prepared with hands that knew not what they did. But now Judith gently roused

her and put in her hand a spade; already she herself had begun. But Alida

stared at it dully, as if she did not understand. Then Judith pointed to

something black that had begun to wheel in the sky, wheel, and with each

circular swoop come closer to the roll of tarpaulin. Then Alida knew, and,

taking the spade, she and Judith began to dig the grave.


XX.

The Ball


The dance in the Benton ranch was the great social event of the midsummer

season. The Bentons had begun to give dances in the days of plenty, when the

cattle industry had been at its dizziest height; and they had continued to give

dances through all the depressing fluctuations of the trade, perhaps in much

the same spirit as one whistles in the dark to keep up his courage. Thus,

though cattle fell and continued to fall in the scale of prices till the end no

man dared surmise, the Benton “boys”—they were two brothers,

aged respectively forty-five and fifty years—continued to hold out

facilities to dance and be merry.


All day strange wagons—ludicrous, makeshift things—had been

discharging loads of women and children at the Benton ranch, tired mothers and

their insistent offspring. To the women this strenuous relaxation came as manna

in the wilderness. What was the dreary round of washing, ironing, baking, and

the chain of household tasks that must be done as primitively as in Genesis, if

only they might dance and forget? So the mothers came early and stayed late,

and the primary sessions of the dances fulfilled all the functions of the

latter-day mothers’ congresses—there were infant ailments to be

discussed, there were the questions of food and of teething, of paregoric and

of flannel bands, which, strange heresy, seemed to be “going out,”

according to the latest advices from those compendiums of all domestic

information, the “Woman’s Pages” of the daily papers.


Inasmuch as these more than punctual debaters must be cooked for, there was, to

speak plainly, “feeling” on the part of the housekeeper at the

Bentons’. Wasn’t it enough for folks to come to a dance and get a

good supper, and go away like Christians when the thing was over, instead of

coming a day before it began and lingering on as if they had no home to go to?

This, at least, was the housekeeper’s point of view, a crochety one, be

it said, not shared by the brothers Benton, whose hospitality was as genuine as

it was primitive. To this same difficult lady the infants, who were too tender

in years to be separated from their mothers, were as productive of anxiety as

their elders. A room had been set apart for their especial accommodation, the

floor of which, carefully spread with bed-quilts and pillows, prevented any

great damage from happening to the more tender of the guests; and they rolled

and crooned and dug their small fists into each other’s faces while their

mothers danced in the room beyond.


By nightfall the Benton ranch gleamed on the dark prairie like a constellation.

Lights burned at every window; a broad beam issued from the door and threw a

welcoming beacon across the darkness and silence of the night. The scraping of

fiddles mingled with the rhythmic scuffle of feet and the singsong of the words

that the dancers sung as they whirled through the figures of the quadrille and

lancers. About the walls of the room where the dancing was in progress stood a

fringe of gallants, their heads newly oiled, and proclaiming the fact in a

bewildering variety of strong perfumes. Red silk neckerchiefs knotted with

elaborate carelessness displayed to advantage bronzed throats; new overalls,

and of the shaggiest species, amply testified to the social importance of the

Benton dance.


As yet the dancing was but intermittent and was engaged in chiefly by the

mothers with large progeny, who felt that after the arrival of a greater number

of guests, and among them the unmarried girls, their opportunities might not be

as plentiful as at present. One or two cow-punchers, in an excess of civility

at the presence of the fair, had insisted on giving up their six-shooters,

mumbling something about “there being ladies present and a man being

hasty at times.” In the “bunk-room,” which did duty as a

gentleman’s cloak-room, things were really warming up. There was much

drinking of healths, as the brothers Benton had thoughtfully provided the

wherewithal, and that in excellent quality.


Costigan was there, and Texas Tyler, who had ridden sixty miles to “swing

a petticoat,” or, if there were not enough to go round, to dance with a

handkerchief tied to some fellow’s sleeve. By “swinging a

petticoat” it was perfectly understood among all his friends that he

meant a chance to dance with Judith Rodney. Year in and year out Texas never

failed to present himself at the post-office on mail-days, if his work took him

within a radius of fifty miles of the Daxes. No dance where the possibility of

seeing Judith was even remote was too long a ride for him to undertake, even

when it took him across the dreariest wastes of the desert. Texas had been

devoted to Judith since she had left the convent, and sometimes, perhaps twice

a year, she told him that she valued his friendship. On all other occasions she

rejected his suit as if his continual pressing of it were something in the

nature of an affront. Yet Texas persevered.


“Well, here’s lukin’ at you, since in the way of a frind

there’s nothing better to look at!” and Costigan drained a tin cup

at Texas Tyler.


“Your very good health,” said Texas, who was somewhat embarrassed

by what was regarded as Costigan’s “floweriness.”


“Begorra, is that Hinderson or the ghost av the b’y?”

Costigan’s roving eye was arrested by the foreman of the

“XXX,” who stood drinking with two or three men of his outfit. He

was pale and ill-looking. He drank several times in succession, as if he needed

the stimulant, and without the formality of drinking to any one. The two or

three “XXX” men who were with him seemed to be equally in need of

restoratives.


They talked of the cattle stampede in which several of the outfits had been

heavy losers. Some nine hundred head of cattle had been recovered, and members

of the different outfits were still scouring the Red Desert for strays.


Something in the nature of a sensation was created by the arrival of the

Wetmore party. The women were frankly interested in the clothes, bearing, and

general deportment of the New-Yorkers. Rumors of Miss Colebrooke’s beauty

were rife, and there was a general inclination to compare her with local

belles. Such exotic types—they had seen these city beauties

before—were as a rule too colorless for their appreciation. They liked

faces that had “more go to them,” was the verdict passed upon one

famous beauty who had visited the Wetmores the year before. In arrangement of

the hair, perhaps, in matters of dress, the judges were willing to concede the

laurels to city damsels, but there concession stopped. But evidently Kitty, to

judge from the elaboration of her toilet, did not intend to be dismissed thus

cursorily. She herself was delicately, palely pretty, as always, but her hair

was tortured to a fashionable fluffiness, and the simplicity of her green

muslin gown was only in the name. It was muslin disguised, elaborated,

beribboned, lace-trimmed till its identity was all but lost in the multitude of

pretty complications.


“Did you know that old Ma’am Yellett had a school-marm up to her

place?” asked one of the men, apropos of Eastern prettiness.


“Well, well,” Costigan reminisced, “’tis some av thim

Yillitt lambs thot’s six fut in their shtockings, if Oi be rimimbering

right. Sure, the tacher ought to be something av a pugilist, Oi’m

thinkin’.”


“I seen her the other day, and a neater little heifer never turned out to

pasture. Lord, I’d like to be gnawing the corners of the primer right

now, if she was there to whale the ruler.”


“Arrah,” bayed Costigan, “but the women question is

gittin’ complicated ontoirely, wid Miss Rodney—an’ herself

lukin’ loike a saint in a church window—dalin’ the mails

an’ th’ other wan tachin’ in the mountains. Sure, this place

is gittin’ to be but a sorry shpot for bachelors loike mesilf.”


“I ain’t mentionin’ no names, but there’s a man here

ain’t treatin’ a mighty fine woman square and accordin’ to

the way she ought to be treated.”


The information ran through the circle like an electric shock. Men stopped in

the act of pledging each other’s healths to listen. Loungers straightened

up; every topic was dropped. The man who had made the statement was the

loose-lipped busybody who had suggested to his host that he give up his

six-shooter since there were “ladies present.”


“What the hell are you waiting for?” queried Texas Tyler, savagely.

“You’ve cracked your whip, made your bow, and got our attention;

why the hell don’t you go on?”


The man looked about nervously. He was rather alarmed at the interest he had

excited. The next moment Peter Hamilton had walked into the room. There was

something crucial in his entrance at this particular time; it crystallized

suspicion. The gossip took advantage of the greetings to Hamilton to make his

escape. Texas Tyler left the bunk-room immediately and looked for him in the

room with the dancers. The fiddles, in the hands of a couple of Mexicans, had

set the whole room whirling as if by magic. As they danced they sang, joining

with the “caller-out,” who held his vociferous post between the

rooms, till the room was full of singing, dancing men and women, who spun and

pirouetted as if they had not a care in the world. But Texas Tyler was not of

these, as he looked through the dancers for his man. There was a red flash in

the pupils of his eyes, and he told himself that he was going to do things the

way they did them in Texas, for, of course, he knew that the loose-lipped idiot

had meant Judith Rodney and Peter Hamilton. Never before had such an idea

occurred to him, and now that it had been presented to his mind’s eye, he

wondered why he had been such a blind fool. Never had the singing to these

dances seemed so absurd.


“Hawk hop out and the crow hop in,

Three hands round and go it ag’in.

Allemane left, back to the missus,

Grande right and left and sneak a few kisses.”


He rushed from the room and down to the stable. At sight of him some one leaped

on a horse and rode out into the darkness.


“Who was that?” asked Texas of a man lounging by the corral.


“That was—” and he gave the name of the loose-lipped man.


Texas cursed long and picturesquely. Then he went back to the bunk-room and

tried to pick a quarrel with Peter Hamilton, who good-naturedly assumed that

his old friend had been drinking and refused to take offence.


Peter went in to ask Kitty to dance with him. All that evening he had been

waiting anxiously for Judith. Meanwhile he had used all his influence as a

newly appointed member of the Wetmore outfit to soothe the ruffled feelings of

the cattle-men. Of the tragedy in the valley he had heard no rumor.


Kitty had come to the point where she was willing to waive the

Récamier-Chateaubriand friendship in favor of one more personal and ordinary.

In fact, as Peter showed a disposition to regard as final her answer to him on

the day he had spurred across the desert, Kitty, with true feminine perversity,

inclined to permit him to resume his suit. His acquiescence in her refusal she

had at first regarded as the turning of the worm; after the wolf-hunt, however,

her meditations were more disturbing. She had never told Peter of that strange

woodland meeting with Judith, yet Judith’s beauty, her probable hold over

Peter, the degree of his affection for her were rankling questions in

Kitty’s consciousness. In the stress of these considerations Kitty lost

her head completely for so old a campaigner. She drew the apron-string

tight—attempted force instead of strategy.


Kitty and Peter finished their waltz, one of the few round dances of the

evening.


“How perfectly you dance, Kitty! It’s a long time since we’ve

had a waltz together.”


The cow-punchers looked at Kitty as if she were not quite flesh and blood. Such

flaxen daintiness, femininty etherealized to angelic perfection, was new to

them, but their admiration was like that given to a delicate exotic which,

wonderful as it is, one is well pleased to view through the glass of the

florist’s window.


Peter was deferentially attentive and zealous to make the Wetmore party have a

thoroughly good time, yet he did all these things, as it were, with his eye on

the door. He was not obviously distrait; he was the man of the world, talking,

making himself agreeable, “doing his duty,” while his

subconsciousness was busy with other matters. It was rather through telepathy

than through any lack of attention paid to her that Kitty realized the state of

things, and in proportion to her realization came a feeling of helplessness; it

was so new, so unexpected, so cruel. He seemed drifting away from her on some

tide of affairs of the very existence of which she had been unconscious.

Further and further he had drifted, till intelligible speech no longer seemed

possible between them. They said the foolish, empty things that people call out

as the boat glides away from the shore, the things that all the world may hear,

and in his eyes there was only that smiling kindness. How had it come about

after all these years? What was it that had first cut the cable that sent him

drifting? What was it? She must think. Oh, who could think with that noise! How

silly was their singing as they danced, how uncouth!


“All dance as pretty as you can,

Turn your toes and left alleman;

    First gent sashay to the right,

Now swing the girl you last swung about,

And now the one that’s cut her out,

    And now the one that’s dressed in white,

And now the belle of the ball.”


The dancers seemed bitten to the quick with the tarantula of an ecstatic

hilarity; their bodies swayed in perfect harmony to the swing of the fiddles

and the swell of the chorus. The most uncouth of them came under the spell of

that mad magic. Their movements, that in the beginning of the dance had been

shy and awkward, became almost beautiful; they forgot arms, hands, feet; their

bodies had become like the strings of some skilfully played instrument,

obediently responsive to rhythm, and in that composite blending of races each

in his dancing brought some of the poetry of his own far land. The scene was

amazing in its beauty and simplicity, like the strong, inspirational power and

rugged rhythm of some old border minstrel. One by one the dancers glowed with

better understanding; discordant elements, alien nations were fused to harmony

in this vivid picture.


Peter turned to Kitty, expecting to see her face aglow with the warmth of it.

She stood beside him, the one unresponsive soul in the room, on her lips a

pale, tolerant smile.


“Aren’t they splendid, Kitty, these women? More than half of them

work like beavers all day, and they have young children and dozens of worries,

but would you suspect it? They’re just the women for this country.”


Now in the present state of affairs almost any other subject would have been

better calculated to promote good feeling than the one on which Peter had

alighted. Kitty’s thoughts had perversely lingered about one who, though

not one with these women, had yet their sturdy self-reliance, their

acquiescence in grim conditions, their pleasure in simple things. Kitty’s

apprehension, slow to kindle, had taken fire like a forest, and by its blaze

she saw things in a distorted light; her present vision magnified the relations

of Peter and Judith to a degree that a month ago she would have regarded as

impossible. “He is her lover!” was the accusation that suddenly

flashed through her mind, and with the thought an overwhelming desire to say

something unkind, something that should hurt him, supplanted all judgment and

reason.


“Oh, it’s a decidedly remarkable scene, pictorially, I agree with

you. And an artist, of course—but isn’t it a trifle quixotic,

Peter, to idealize them because they are having a good time? There’s no

virtue in it. It is conceivable that they might have to work just as hard and

have just as many little children to look after, and yet not have these dances

you praise them for coming to.”


“I’m afraid you find us and our amusements a little crude.

Evidently the spirit of our dances does not appeal to you; but I did not

suppose it necessary to remind you that they should not be judged by the

standard of conventional evening parties,” said Peter, hurt and angry in

his turn.


“Us, our amusements, our dances? So you are quite identified with these

people, my dear Peter, and I had thought you an ornament of cotillions and

country clubs. I can only infer that it is somebody in particular who has

brought about your change of heart.”


Peter flushed a little, and Kitty kept on: “Some of the native belles are

quite wonderful, I believe. Nannie Wetmore tells of a half-breed who is very

handsome.”


Peter set his lips. “At the expense of spoiling Nannie’s pretty

romance, I must tell you that the lady she refers to is not only the most

beautiful of women, but she would be at ease in any drawing-room. It would be

as ridiculous to apply the petty standards of ladyhood to her as it would

to—well, imagine some foolish girl bringing up the question at a

woman’s club—‘Was Joan of Arc a lady?’” Peter

spoke without calculating the conviction that his words carried. He was angry,

and his manner, voice, intonation showed it.


Kitty, now that her most unworthy suspicions had been confirmed by

Peter’s ardent championing of Judith, lost her discretion in the pang

that gnawed her little soul: “I beg your pardon, Peter. When I spoke I

did not, of course, know that this young woman was anything to you.”


“Anything to me? My dear Kitty, I’ve never had a better friend than

Judith Rodney.”


The dance was at its flood-tide. The exhilaration had grown with each sweep of

the fiddle-bow, with the sorcery of sinuous, swaying bodies, with the song of

the dancers as they joined in the calling out of the figures, with the rhythmic

shuffle of feet, with the hum of the pulses, with the leaping of blood to cheek

and heart till the dancers whirled as leaves circling towards the eddies of a

whirlpool. The dancing Mrs. Dax split her favors into infinitesimal fragments,

for each measure of which her long list of waiting gallants stood ready to pick

a quarrel if need be. Her dancing, in the splendor of its spontaneity, had

something of the surge of the west wind sweeping over a field of grain.

Sometimes she waved back her partner and alone danced a figure, putting to the

music her own interpretation—barbaric, passionate, rude, but

magnificently vivid. And the dancers would stop and crowd about her, clapping

hands and stamping feet to the rhyming movement of her body, while against the

wall her hostile sister-in-law, Mrs. Leander, stood and glared in a fury of

disapproval, Leander himself smiling broadly meanwhile and exercising the

utmost restraint to keep from joining Mrs. Johnnie’s train.


The “XXX” men, who had remained aloof from the dancers and the

merriment, keeping a faithful vigil in the bunk-room, where the hospitable

bottles were to be found, seemed to awaken from the spell that had bound them

all day. Henderson, the foreman, whose face had not lost its tallow paleness

despite the number of his potations, put his head through the door to have a

look at the dancing Mrs. Dax, was caught in the outermost eddy of the whirling

throng, and was soon dancing as madly as the others. The rest of the

“XXX” party still hugged the bunk-room, where the bottles gleamed

hospitable. They were still dusty from their long ride of the early morning,

and more than once their fear-quickened imaginations had been haunted by the

spectre of the dead cotton-woods, from which something heavy and limp and warm

had been swaying when they left it. Henderson had secured the dancing Mrs. Dax

for a partner. The “caller-out,” stationed between the two rooms,

warmed to his genial task. He improvised, he put a wealth of imagination and

personality into his work, he showered compliments on the nimbleness of Mrs.

Dax’s feet, he joked Henderson on his pallor, he attempted a florid

venture at Kitty. Miguel put fresh magic into his bowing, José’s fiddle

rioted with the madness of it.


Judith stood for a moment in the kindly enveloping darkness, and her heart

cried out in protest at the thing she must do. It was the utmost cruelty of

fate that forced her here to dance on the evening of the day that they had

killed him. But she must do it, that his children might evade the stigma of

“cattle-thief,” that the shadow of the gallows-tree might not fall

across their young lives, that the neighbors might give credence to the tale of

Jim’s escape from his enemies, that Alida and she might earn the pittance

that would give the children the “clean start” that Jim had set his

heart on so confidently. And she must dance and be the merriest of them all

that these things might happen, but again and again she deferred the dread

moment. The light, the music, the voices, the shuffle of the feet came to her

as she stood forlorn in the grateful darkness. On the wall the shadows of the

dancers, magnified and grotesque, parodied their movements, as they contended

there, monstrous, uncouth shapes, like prehistoric monsters gripping, clinching

in some mighty struggle; and above it all sang out the wild rhythm of

Miguel’s fiddle, and young José’s bow capered madly.


Judith drew close to the window, and the merriment struck chill at her heart

like the tolling of a knell. She saw the pale face of Henderson gleam

yellow-white among the dancers, and, watching him, the blood-lust of the Indian

woke in her heart. The rest of the room was but a blur; the dancers faded into

swaying shadows; she saw nothing but Henderson as he danced that he might

forget the gray of morning, the black, dead trees, and the grotesque thing with

head awry that swayed in the breeze like a pendulum. He dreaded the long, black

ride that would bring him to his camp, for he alone of the lynchers remained.

Something was drawing his gaze out into the blackness of the night. He

struggled against the temptation to look towards the window. He whirled the Dax

woman till her twinkling feet cleared the floor. He sang to the accompaniment

of Miguel’s fiddle. He was outwitting the thing that dangled before his

eyes, having the incontrovertible last word with a vengeance. And as he danced

and swayed, all unwittingly his glance fell on the window opposite, and Jim

Rodney’s face looked in at him, beautiful in its ecstasy of

hate—Rodney’s face, refined, sharpened, tried in some bitter

crucible, but Rodney’s face! Henderson could not withdraw his fascinated

gaze. He stood in the midst of the dancers like a man turned to stone. He put

up his hand to his eyes as if to brush away a cloud of swarming gnats, then

threw up his arms and rushed from the room. The dancers paused in their mad

whirl. Miguel’s bow stopped with a wailing shriek. Every eye turned

towards the window for an explanation of Henderson’s sudden panic, but

all was dark without on the prairie. The magic had gone from the dance, the

whirlwind of drapery that had swung like flags in a breeze dropped in dead air.

“What was it?” the dancers asked one another in whispers.


And for answer Judith entered, but a Judith that was strange to them. There was

about her a white radiance that kept the dancers back, and in her eyes

something of Mary’s look, as she turned from Calvary. The dancers still

kept the position of the figures, the men with their arms about their

partners’ waists, the women stepping forward; they were like the painted

figures of dancers in a fresco. And among them stood Judith, waiting to play

her part, waiting to show her world that she could dance and be merry because

all was well with her and hers. But the bronzed sons of the saddle hung back,

they who a day before would have quarrelled for the honor of a dance. They were

afraid of her; it would be like dancing with the death angel. She looked from

face to face. Surely some one would ask her to dance, and her eyes fell on

Henderson, returning from the bottled courage in the bunk-room. Some word was

due from him to explain his terror of a moment ago.


“Oh, Miss Judith, I thought you was a ghost when I seen you at the

window.”


“A ghost that’s ready to dance.” She held out her hand to

him. In her gesture there was something of royal command, and Henderson,

reading the meaning in her eyes, stepped forward. Her face, almost a perfect

replica of the dead man’s, looked at him.


“I bring you greeting from my brother,” she said. “He has

gone on a long journey.”


Henderson started. Through the still room ran the murmur, “Rodney’s

outwitted them; he’s played a joke on the rope!” And Judith, his

dare-devil sister, had come with his greetings to Henderson, leader of the

faction against him! The tide had turned. The applause that is ever the meed of

the winner was hers to command. The cattle faction were ready to sing the

praises of her splendid audacity. In their hearts they were glad in the thought

that Jim had outwitted them.


Miguel’s bow dashed across the strings, and he drew from the little brown

fiddle music that again made them merry and glowing. The magic came back to the

dance, the blood leaped again with the merry madness, and they swept to the

bowing like leaves when the first faint wail of winter cries in the trees.


Hamilton, standing apart with Kitty Colebrooke, had been a dazed witness of the

scene. With the rest he had watched the entrance of Judith, had been stunned by

the change in her appearance, had seen her triumph and heard the rumor of

Jim’s escape, and his heart had warmed with the good word. She had

probably managed the plan, and had come to-night, in the joy of her triumph, to

hurl in their faces that she had outwitted them. And she had paid the penalty

of her courage—her face told that. What a woman she was! Her heart would

pay the penalty to the last throb, and yet she could dance with the merriest of

them. And as she danced she seemed to Peter Hamilton, in her white draperies,

like a cloud of whirling snow-flakes drifting across the silence of the desert

night. She was the one woman in all the world for him, though his blind eyes

had faced the light for years and had not known it. He had squandered the

strength of his youth in the pursuit of a little wax light, and had not marked

the serene shining of the moon.


“And a man there was and he made his prayer—” he quoted to

himself. Well, thank God that it had not been answered. He would take her away

from here. She could take her place in his family and reflect credit on his

choice. His family, his friends—he winced at the thought of their

possible reception of the news. But Judith’s presence would adjust these

difficulties. He would present her to Kitty now, that his old friend might see

what manner of woman she was. Kitty, he felt, would be kind in memory of the

old days. She would give to them both in friendship what she had denied him in

love. And as he warmed to the thought he turned to the woman of his youth. And

she read a look in his face that had not been there in a long time. Had he,

then, come back to her? Was the distance from bark to shore lessening as the

sea of misunderstanding diminished?


“Kitty, we were speaking a moment ago of Miss Rodney. You would like to

know her, I’m sure. We’ve been such good friends all these years

while you were deciding that what I wanted was not good for us—and

deciding wisely, as I know now. Look at her! You’ll understand how she

has helped me keep the balance of things. When she’s finished dancing

you’ll let me bring her to you, won’t you?”


And Kitty, who had expected much different words, struggled with the meaning of

these unexpected ones. The strangeness of the pain bewildered her. Her dazed

consciousness refused to accept that Peter was asking permission to present to

her a woman whom she thought should not have been permitted to enter her

presence. There was about her a white flame of anger that seemed to lick up the

red blood in her veins as she turned to answer:


“She is undeniably handsome, Peter, but I do not care to meet your

mistress.”


He bowed low to her as Lieutenant Swift, of Fort Washakie, who was of the

Wetmore party, came to claim Kitty’s hand for the next dance. Judith and

Henderson were leading the last figure, their hands clasped high in an arch

through which the dancers trooped in couples. Again and again he tried to catch

Judith’s eye, but her glance never once met his. Her great, wide eyes had

a far-away look as if they saw some tragedy, the shadow of which would never

fall from her. She was, indeed, the tragic muse in her floating white drapery,

the tragic muse whose grief is too deep for tears. He watched her as she swept

towards him in the figure of the dance, the head thrown back, slightly

foreshortened, the mouth smiling with the smile that knows all things, the eyes

holy wells of truth. He saw in her something of the tenderness of Eve, for all

the blending of the calm modern woman, capable in affairs, equal to emergency.

It was like her to contrive her brother’s escape and then to dance with

the very men who had knotted the noose for his hanging. Henderson was bowing to

her, the dance was over, and the next moment she was alone.


“Is it you, Peter?” She thrust a strand of hair back from her

temple. Her eyes rested on him for a moment, then wandered, till in their

absent look was the rapt expression of the sleep-walker. The dark-rimmed eyes

had in their depths the quiet of a conflagration, and Peter, seeing these

things, and knowing the gamut of all her moods, saw that he had been mistaken.

She had not come, to dance in triumph, in the face of her brother’s

enemies. There was no triumph in her face, but white, consuming despair.


“Did you ask me to dance?” Again she put back the strand of hair.

“Forgive me for being so stupid, but I’ve kept post-office to-day,

and had a long ride, and I danced with Henderson.”


He drew her arm within his and led the way out through the crowd of dancers to

the star-strewn night. She did not speak again, nor did she seem to notice that

they had left the room with the dancers. She turned her face towards the lonely

valley, where the drama of her brother’s passing had been consummated,

and something there was in her look as it turned towards the hills that told

Peter.


“Tell me, Judith, ‘what has happened?”


For answer she pointed towards the valley. “They did it last night at the

dead cotton-woods. Henderson led them. I could not stay with Alida. I had to

come here to dance that no one might suspect.”


Her voice was steady, but low and thrilling. In its deep resonance was the echo

of all human sorrow. There was no hint of accusation, yet Peter felt accused.

He felt, now when it was too late, that his position had been one of almost

pusillanimous negligence. From the beginning he had taken a firm stand against

violent measures. He had talked, argued, reasoned, inveighed against violence;

no later than a week ago he had ridden across the desert to tell Henderson that

the Wetmore outfit would take no part in violence of any sort, and that the

cattle outfit that did resort to extreme measures would miss the support of the

“W-Square” in any future range business. But it had not been

enough. He should have made plain his position in regard to Judith. With her as

his future wife the tragedy of the valley would not have been possible.


From the ranch-house came the swell of the fiddles, the rhythmic shuffle of

feet, the song of the dancers, dulled by distance. Beside him was Judith, a

white spirit, the woman in her dead of grief. And yet, through all the grim

horror of the tragedy she remembered the part that had been allotted to her,

threw all the weight of her personality on the side of the game she was

playing.


“You must be on our side, Peter, and when there is talk of Jim’s

absence you must imply that he is East somewhere. You will know how to meet

such inquiries better than we women. Henderson will be only too glad. You

should have seen the wretch when I held out my hand to him and told him to

dance with me. He came, white and shambling; we have nothing to fear from

Henderson. Alida has no money to go away with. She and I must stay here and

make a beginning for the children, and, Peter, we want you to help us.”


He had no voice to answer her brave words for a minute, and then his sentences

came uncertain and halting.


“You must think me a poor sort of friend, Judith, one who has been blind

till the eleventh hour and is then found wanting. I feel so guilty to you, to

your brother’s wife, to that little child who put out his arms so

trustfully to me that night, but I never imagined that things would come to

such a pass as this. The smaller cattle outfits have been doing a good deal of

blustering, but the more conservative element supposed that they had them in

check, and did not for a moment think that they would take the law into their

own hands. Believe me, this lawlessness has been in the face of every influence

that could be brought to bear, and it shall not go unpunished.”


She spoke to him from the darkness, as the spirit of grief might speak.

“An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, that is the justice of the

plains. But, Peter, it is but poor justice. What’s done is done, and

fresh violence will not give back Alida her husband nor the little ones their

father. What we need is friends, one or two loyal souls who, though knowing the

hideous truth of this thing, will stand by us in our pitiful falsehood. I have

told no one, nor shall I, but you and—Peter, you must not laugh at your

fellow-conspirator—Leander.”


He took her hands in his and pressed them; big hands they were, and hardened by

many a homely task, but withal tender and with the healing quality of

womanliness in the touch of their warm, supple fingers. But to-night she did

not seem to know that he held them, nor to be conscious of his presence. The

woman in her was dead of grief. The white spirit in her place, that plotted and

planned that Jim’s children and Jim’s wife might not from

henceforth walk in the shadow of the gallows, was beyond the prompting of the

flesh. And again she spoke to him in the same far-away voice, with the same

far-away look in her eyes.


“You must know, Peter, that Leander is at heart of the salt of the earth.

I told him about it all, and he asked to be given the commission to deal with

the men. He has risen to his post magnificently. I heard him swear the wretches

to secrecy, hint to them that he had a great story to tell them. They were

frightened, and listened. And the poor little man that we have so despised told

them convincingly how Jim had made good his escape—even Henderson half

believes we saved him.”


Peter hoped that she would accuse him of his half-heartedness indirectly, if

not openly. It would have made his conscience more comfortable, and his

conscience troubled him sorely to-night. It was that fatal habit of

procrastination that had brought this thing about. He had hesitated all these

weeks about Judith, and while he had threshed out the pro and con of her

disadvantageous family connection, this hideous tragedy had happened.


“Peter”—and now her eyes seemed to come back to earth again,

to lose something of the far-away look of the sleep-walker—“Peter,

I’m cruel to speak to you of these things now. When your heart is full of

your own happiness, I come to you like a dark shadow with this tragedy. But I

am glad for the good that has come to you, Peter. Perhaps Miss Colebrooke told

you of the day I met her in the wood, the day of the wolf-hunt. She was so

beautiful, I understood—”


“Judith, I hardly know how to say what I am going to, I feel that I have

been such a bad friend to you, but you must hear me patiently. Together, if you

are willing, after knowing all of me that you do, we must look after your

brother’s children. That night in the little house in the valley, when

the little chap came to me, don’t you remember, there was something fine

and fearless in the way he did it. ‘You may belong to the cattle side of

the argument,’ he seemed to say, ‘but I trust you.’ Now,

Judith dear, that boy’s faith in me is not going to be shaken. We must

look after them together. It is a very little thing you have asked of me, my

dearest, but a very big one that I am asking of you. Do you understand, my

Judith, it is you that I want? Don’t think of me as I have been, Judith,

but as you are going to make me. I want you to give me the right now, this

evening, to share all this trouble with you. Do we understand each other,

Judith? Is it to be? And will you come back with me now, into the room where

they are dancing, and let me present you to them, to the Wetmores, as my

Judith, my betrothed?”


“But, Peter, I don’t understand. I—I thought you and Miss

Colebrooke were—”


“That’s all over, Judith. I did love her once. Oh, you dear, brave

woman, I’m not a hero from any point of view, and you know it. It’s

but a sorry lover that’s making his prayer to you, my dearest; but you

won’t judge, I know, beloved, you will love me instead?”


Judith turned towards the valley. Her whole being throbbed with a passionate

response to the man who stood so humbly before her, but there were duties that

came first. Her mind was full of Alida and her children, and her eyes still

sought Peter’s imploringly.


“You will be a good friend to them, Peter—to Jim’s people? I

cannot talk to you of anything else to-night. Your heart is big, Peter, but you

cannot feel, perhaps—”


“Listen, Judith. Whatever friendship and protection I can give your

family you may count upon from now till the end of time. I will be theirs as I

am yours. I feel your grief, but I want to soothe it, too. And if you love me,

and I feel, Judith, that you do, you must let them all see to-night, these

people who know us both, that we stand together before all the world for better

or worse. Think, Judith, and you will see that you owe it to yourself, to me,

to all these men, who reverence you as the one woman, the one ideal in their

lonely lives.”


She could not speak. The moment was too full, the strain had been too great;

but she smiled surrender, and Peter caught her tenderly in his arms and kissed

her once—his Judith she was now, his heroine. Then, without another word,

he drew her arm through his and led her back to the lights, where the dancers

still held high carnival.


Judith’s half-sister, Eudora, was making a pretty quarrel by perversely

forgetting the order in which she had given her dances. The girl was so

undeniably happy that Judith dreaded the grim news she must tell her. Eudora

blushed as she encountered Judith’s eye. Her half-sister ever offered a

check on Eudora’s exuberant coquetry, with its precipitation of

discussions that often ended in bullets. Leander stood on the outermost fringe

of Eudora’s potential partners. He would not have dared to maintain it

openly, yet he was sure the pretty minx had promised that dance to him.


“Dance with Leander, dear, and don’t let those men begin

quarrelling. I’ve something to tell you, presently,” said Judith.


Texas Tyler stood glowering at them from the doorway. He would not catch

Judith’s eye as she tried to speak to him. Kitty sat alone for the

moment. She had sent the young lieutenant to fetch her a cup of coffee, but as

Peter approached with Judith she averted her eyes.


“Kitty, may I present to you my fiancée, Miss Rodney?”


Kitty rose superbly to the situation. She might, indeed, have made the match

she was so overjoyed in the good-fortune of her old friend Peter. She made no

reference to the woodland meeting—she hoped for the happiness of seeing

them in town. And she bade Peter tell the good news to Nannie Wetmore, they

would be so glad. Nannie swallowed a grimace and proffered a cousinly hand. She

had suspected some such news as this when she saw that things were not going

well with Kitty and Peter.


“Better one dance with a good partner that can swing ye than several with

a feeble partner that leaves ye to swing your own corners!”


Judith looked up, smiling. She recognized the characteristic utterance of her

old friend Mrs. Yellett. The matriarch had sustained a breakdown, and arrived,

in consequence, when the dance was half over, but she was philosophical, as

always, in the face of misfortune, and loudly attested her pleasure in the

renowned pedal feats of her partner, Costigan.


Behind came Mary Carmichael, looking brown and happy. From the attitude of the

group around Judith and Peter Mary divined what had happened, and came to add

her congratulations. Even Mrs. Yellett forgot to choose an axiom as her medium

of expression, and kissed Judith publicly, with affectionate unction. Henderson

had effaced himself, and Leander, proud of his triumph and Judith’s

commendation, sat in a corner and smiled contentedly. Ignorant of the drama to

which they had played chorus, the dancers still riotously swung one another up

and down the length of the room, and from the little brown fiddles came the gay

music of Judith’s betrothal.


THE END
