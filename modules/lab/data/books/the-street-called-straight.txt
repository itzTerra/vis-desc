THE STREET CALLED STRAIGHT

I
A
s a matter of fact, Davenant was under no

illusions concerning the quality of the welcome his hostess was

according him, though he found a certain pleasure in being once

more in her company. It was not a keen pleasure, but neither was it

an embarrassing one; it was exactly what he supposed it would be in

case they ever met again—a blending on his part of curiosity,

admiration, and reminiscent suffering out of which time and

experience had taken the sting. He retained the memory of a minute

of intense astonishment once upon a time, followed by some weeks,

some months perhaps, of angry humiliation; but the years between

twenty-four and thirty-three are long and varied, generating in

healthy natures plenty of saving common sense. Work, travel, and a

widened knowledge of men and manners had so ripened Davenant's mind

that he was able to see his proposal now as Miss Guion must have

seen it then, as something so incongruous and absurd as not only to

need no consideration, but to call for no reply. Nevertheless, it

was the refusal on her part of a reply, of the mere laconic No

which was all that, in his heart of hearts, he had ever expected,

that rankled in him longest; but even that mortification had

passed, as far as he knew, into the limbo of extinct regrets. For

her present superb air of having no recollection of his blunder he

had nothing but commendation. It was as becoming to the spirited

grace of its wearer as a royal mantle to a queen. Carrying it as

she did, with an easy, preoccupied affability that enabled her to

look round him and over him and through him, to greet him and

converse with him, without seeming positively to take in the fact

of his existence, he was permitted to suppose the incident of their

previous acquaintance, once so vital to himself, to have been

forgotten. If this were so, it would be nothing very strange, since

a woman of twenty-seven, who has had much social experience, may be

permitted to lose sight of the more negligible of the conquests she

has made as a girl of eighteen. She had asked him to dinner, and

placed him honorably at her right; but words could not have made it

plainer than it was that he was but an accident to the

occasion.
He was there, in short, because he was staying with Mr. and Mrs.

Temple. After a two years' absence from New England he had arrived

in Waverton that day, "Oh, bother! bring him along," had been the

formula in which Miss Guion had conveyed his invitation, the dinner

being but an informal, neighborly affair. Two or three wedding

gifts having arrived from various quarters of the world, it was

natural that Miss Guion should want to show them confidentially to

her dear friend and distant relative, Drusilla Fane. Mrs. Fane had

every right to this privileged inspection, since she had not only

timed her yearly visit to her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Temple, so that

it should synchronize with the wedding, but had introduced Olivia

to Colonel Ashley, in the first place. Indeed, there had been a

rumor at Southsea, right up to the time of Miss Guion's visit to

the pretty little house on the Marine Parade, that the colonel's

calls and attentions there had been not unconnected with Mrs. Fane

herself; but rumor in British naval and military stations is

notoriously overactive, especially in matters of the heart. Certain

it is, however, that when the fashionable London papers announced

that a marriage had been arranged, and would shortly take place,

between Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Ashley, of the Sussex Rangers,

and of Heneage Place, Belvoir, Leicestershire, and Olivia Margaret,

only child of Henry Guion, Esquire, of Tory Hill, Waverton, near

Boston, Massachusetts, U.S.A., no one offered warmer

congratulations than the lady in whose house the interesting pair

had met. There were people who ascribed this attitude to the fact

that, being constitutionally "game," she refused to betray her

disappointment. She had been "awfully game," they said, when poor

Gerald Fane, also of the Sussex Rangers, was cut off with enteric

at Peshawur. But the general opinion was to the effect that, not

wanting Rupert Ashley (for some obscure, feminine reason) for

herself, she had magnanimously bestowed him elsewhere. Around

tea-tables, and at church parade, it was said "Americans do that,"

with some comment on the methods of the transfer.
On every ground, then, Drusilla was entitled to this first look

at the presents, some of which had come from Ashley's brother

officers, who were consequently brother officers of the late

Captain Fane; so that when she telephoned saying she was afraid

that they, her parents and herself, couldn't come to dinner that

evening, because a former ward of her father's—Olivia must

remember Peter Davenant!—was arriving to stay with them for a

week or two, Miss Guion had answered, "Oh, bother! bring him

along," and the matter was arranged. It was doubtful, however, that

she knew him in advance to be the Peter Davenant who nine years

earlier had had the presumption to fall in love with her; it was

still more doubtful, after she had actually shaken hands with him

and called him by name, whether she paid him the tribute of any

kind of recollection. The fact that she had seated him at her

right, in the place that would naturally be accorded to Rodney

Temple, the scholarly director of the Department of Ceramics in the

Harvard Gallery of Fine Arts, made it look as if she considered

Davenant a total stranger. In the few conventionally gracious words

she addressed to him, her manner was that of the hostess who

receives a good many people in the course of a year toward the

chance guest she had never seen before and expects never to see

again.
"Twice round the world since you were last in Boston? How

interesting!" Then, as if she had said enough for courtesy, she

continued across the lights and flowers to Mrs. Fane: "Drusilla,

did you know Colonel Ashley had declined that post at Gibraltar?

I'm so glad. I should hate the Gib."
"The Gib wouldn't hate you," Mrs. Fane assured her. "You'd have

a heavenly time there. Rupert Ashley is deep in the graces of old

Bannockburn, who's in command. He's not a bad old sort, old Ban

isn't, though he's a bit of a martinet. Lady Ban is awful—a

bounder in petticoats. She looks like that."
Drusilla pulled down the corners of a large, mobile mouth, so as

to simulate Lady Bannockburn's expression, in a way that drew a

laugh from every one at the table but the host. Henry Guion

remained serious, not from natural gravity, but from inattention.

He was obviously not in a mood for joking, nor apparently for

eating, since he had scarcely tasted his soup and was now only

playing with the fish. As this corroborated what Mrs. Temple had

more than once asserted to her husband during the past few weeks,

that "Henry Guion had something on his mind," she endeavored to

exchange a glance with him, but he was too frankly enjoying the

exercise of his daughter's mimetic gift to be otherwise

observant.
"And what does Colonel Ashley look like, Drucie?" he asked,

glancing slyly at Miss Guion.
"Like that," Mrs. Fane said, instantly. Straightening the

corners of her mouth and squaring her shoulders, she fixed her eyes

into a stare of severity, and stroked horizontally an imaginary

mustache, keeping the play up till her lips quivered.
"It is like him," Miss Guion laughed.
"Is he as stiff as all that?" the professor inquired.
"Not stiff," Miss Guion explained, "only dignified."
"Dignified!" Drusilla cried. "I should think so. He's just like

Olivia herself. It's perfectly absurd that those two should marry.

Apart, they're a pair of splendid specimens; united, they'll be too

much of a good thing. They're both so well supplied with the same

set of virtues that when they look at each other it'll be like

seeing their own faces in a convex mirror. It'll be simply

awful."
Her voice had the luscious English intonation, in spite of its

being pitched a little too high. In speaking she displayed the

superior, initiated manner apt to belong to women who bring the

flavor of England into colonial and Indian garrison towns—a

manner Drusilla had acquired notably well, considering that not ten

years previous her life had been bounded by American college

class-days. Something of this latter fact persisted,

notwithstanding her English articulation and style of doing her

hair. Her marriage had been the accident of a winter spent with her

mother in Bermuda, at a time when the Sussex Rangers were stationed

there. Her engagement to Captain Gerald Fane—son of the Very

Reverend the Dean of Silchester—was the result of a series of

dances given chiefly in the Hamilton hotels. Marriage brought the

girl born and bred in a New England college town into a kind of

life for which she had had no preparation; but she adapted herself

as readily as she would have done had she married a Russian prince

or a Spanish grandee. In the effort she made there was a mingling

of the matter-of-fact and the tour de force. Regimental

life is not unlike that of a large family; it has the same sort of

claims, intimacies, and quarrels, the same sort of jealousies

within, combined with solidarity against the outsider. Perceiving

this quickly, Drusilla proceeded to disarm criticism by being

impeccable in dress and negatively amiable in conduct. "With my

temperament," she said to herself, "I can afford to wait."

Following her husband to Barbados, the Cape, and India, she had

just succeeded in passing all the tests of the troop-ship and the

married quarters when he died. For a while her parents hoped she

would make her widowed home in Boston; but her heart had been given

irrevocably to the British army—to its distinguished

correctness, to its sober glories, its world-wide roving, and its

picturesque personal associations. Though she had seen little of

England, except for occasional visits on leave, she had become

English in tastes and at heart. For a year after Gerald's death she

lived with his family at Silchester, in preference to going to her

own. After that she settled in the small house at Southsea, where

from time to time she had her girlhood's companion, Olivia Guion,

as a guest.
"Perhaps that'll do us good," Miss Guion ventured, in reply to

Drusilla's observations at her expense. "To see ourselves as others

see us must be much like looking at one's face in a spoon."
"That doesn't do us any good," Rodney Temple corrected, "because

we always blame the spoon."
"Don't you mind them, dear," Mrs. Temple cooed. She was a

little, apple-faced woman, with a figure suggestive of a tea-cozy,

and a voice with a gurgle in it, like a dove's. A nervous,

convulsive moment of her pursed-up little mouth made that organ an

uncertain element in her physiognomy, shifting as it did from one

side of her face to the other with the rapidity of an aurora

borealis. "Don't mind them, dear. A woman can never do more than

reflect 'broken lights' of her husband, when she has a good one.

Don't you love that expression?—'broken lights'? 'We are but

broken lights of Thee!' Dear Tennyson! And no word yet from Madame

de Melcourt."
"I don't expect any now," Olivia explained. "If Aunt Vic had

meant to write she would have done it long ago. I'm afraid I've

offended her past forgiveness."
She held her head slightly to one side, smiling with an air of

mock penitence.
"Dear, dear!" Mrs. Temple murmured, sympathetically. "Just

because you wouldn't marry a Frenchman!"
"And a little because I'm going to marry an Englishman.

To Aunt Vic all Englishmen are grocers."
"Horrid old thing!" Drusilla said, indignantly.
"It's because she doesn't know them, of course," Olivia went on.

"It's one of the things I never can understand—how people can

generalize about a whole nation because they happen to dislike one

or two individuals. As a matter of fact, Aunt Vic has become so

absorbed in her little circle of old French royalist noblesse that

she can't see anything to admire outside the rue de

l'Université and château life in Normandy. She does

admit that there's an element of homespun virtue in the old

families of Boston and Waverton; but that's only because she

belongs to them herself."
"The capacity of the American woman for being domesticated in an

alien environment," observed Rodney Temple, "is only equaled by the

dog's."
"We're nomadic, father," Drusilla asserted, "and migratory.

We've always been so. It's because we're Saxons and Angles and

Celts and Normans, and—"
"Saxon and Norman and Dane are we," Mrs. Temple quoted,

gently.
"They've always been fidgeting about the world, from one country

to another," Drusilla continued, "and we've inherited the taste. If

we hadn't, our ancestors would never have crossed the Atlantic, in

the first place. And now that we've got here, and can't go any

farther in this direction, we're on the jump to get back again.

That's all there is to it. It's just in the blood. Isn't it, Peter?

Isn't it, Cousin Henry?"
Drusilla had a way of appealing to whatever men were present, as

though her statements lacked something till they had received

masculine corroboration.
"All the same, I wish you could have managed the thing without

giving offence to Aunt Vic."
The words were Henry Guion's first since sitting down to

table.
"I couldn't help it, papa. I didn't give Aunt Vic

offence; she took it."
"She's always been so fond of you—"
"I'm fond of her. She's an old darling. And yet I

couldn't let her marry me off to a Frenchman, in the French way,

when I'd made up my mind to—to do something else. Could I,

Cousin Cherry?"
Mrs. Temple plumed herself, pleased at being appealed to. "I

don't see how you could, dear. But I suppose your dear

aunt—great-aunt, that is—has become so foreign that

she's forgotten our simple ways. So long as you follow your heart,

dear—"
"I've done that, Cousin Cherry."
The tone drew Davenant's eyes to her again, not in scrutiny, but

for the pleasure it gave him to see her delicate features suffused

with a glow of unexpected softness. It was unexpected, because her

bearing had always conveyed to him, even in the days when he was in

love with her, an impression of very refined, very subtle

haughtiness. It seemed to make her say, like Marie Antoinette to

Madame Vigée-Lebrun: "They would call me arrogant if I were

not a queen." The assumption of privilege and prerogative might be

only the inborn consciousness of distinction, but he fancied it

might be more effective for being tempered. Not that it was

overdone. It was not done at all. If the inner impulse working

outward poised a neat, classic head too loftily, or shot from gray

eyes, limpid and lovely in themselves, a regard that was

occasionally too imperious, Olivia Guion was probably unaware of

these effects. With beauty by inheritance, refinement by

association, and taste and "finish" by instinct, it was possible

for her to engage with life relatively free from the cumbrous

impedimenta of self-consciousness. It was because Davenant was able

to allow for this that his judgment on her pride of manner,

exquisite though it was, had never been more severe; none the less,

it threw a new light on his otherwise slight knowledge of her

character to note the faint blush, the touch of gentleness, with

which she hinted her love for her future husband. He had scarcely

believed her capable of this kind of condescension.
He called it condescension because he saw, or thought he saw, in

her approaching marriage, not so much the capture of her heart as

the fulfilment of her ambitions. He admitted that, in her case,

there was a degree to which the latter would imply the former,

since she was the sort of woman who would give her love in the

direction in which her nature found its fitting outlet. He judged

something from what Drusilla Fane had said, as they were driving

toward Tory Hill that evening.
"Olivia simply must marry a man who'll give her

something to do besides sitting round and looking handsome. With

Rupert Ashley she'll have the duties of a public, or semi-public,

position. He'll keep her busy, if it's only opening bazars and

presenting prizes at Bisley. The American men who've tried to marry

her have wanted to be her servants, when all the while she's been

waiting for a master."
Davenant understood that, now that it was pointed out to him,

though the thought would not have come to him spontaneously. She

was the strong woman who would yield only to a stronger man.

Colonel Ashley might not be stronger than she in intellect or

character, but he had done some large things on a large field, and

was counted an active force in a country of forceful activities.

There might be a question as to whether he would prove to be her

master, but he would certainly never think of being her slave.
"What are you going to do, Henry, when the gallant

stranger carries off Olivia, a fortnight hence?"
Though she asked the question with the good intention of drawing

her host into the conversation, Mrs. Temple made it a point to

notice the effort with which he rallied himself to meet her

words.
"What am I going to do?" he repeated, absently. "Oh, my future

will depend very much on—Hobson's choice."
"That's true," Miss Guion agreed, hurriedly, as though to

emphasize a point. "It's all the choice I've left to him. I've

arranged everything for papa—beautifully. He's to take in a

partner perhaps two partners. You know," she continued in

explanation to Mrs. Fane—"you know that poor papa has been

the whole of Guion, Maxwell & Guion since Mr. Maxwell died.

Well, then, he's to take in a partner or two, and gradually shift

his business into their hands. That wouldn't take more than a

couple of years at longest. Then he's going to retire, and come to

live near me in England. Rupert says there's a small place close to

Heneage that would just suit him. Papa has always liked the English

hunting country, and so—"
"And so everything will be for the best," Rodney Temple

finished. "There's nothing like a fresh young mind, like a young

lady's, for settling business affairs. It would have taken you or

me a long time to work that plan out, wouldn't it, Henry? We should

be worried over the effect on our trusteeships and the big estates

we've had the care of—"
"What about the big estates?"
Davenant noticed the tone in which Guion brought out this

question, though it was an hour later before he understood its

significance. It was a sharp tone, the tone of a man who catches an

irritating word or two among remarks he has scarcely followed.

Temple apparently had meant to call it forth, since he answered,

with the slightest possible air of intention:
"Oh, nothing—except what I hear."
While Miss Guion and Mrs. Fane chatted of their own affairs

Davenant remarked the way in which Henry Guion paused, his knife

and fork fixed in the chicken wing on his plate, and gazed at his

old friend. He bent slightly forward, too, looking, with his superb

head and bust slightly French in style, very handsome and

imposing.
"Then you've been—hearing—things?"
Rodney Temple lowered his eyes in a way that confirmed

Davenant—who knew his former guardian's tricks of

manner—in his suppositions. He was so open in countenance

that anything momentarily veiled on his part, either in speech or

in address, could reasonably be attributed to stress of

circumstances. The broad forehead, straight-forward eyes, and large

mouth imperfectly hidden by a shaggy beard and mustache, were of

the kind that lend themselves to lucidity and candor. Externally he

was the scholar, as distinct from the professional man or the

"divine." His figure—tall, large-boned, and

loose-jointed—had the slight stoop traditionally associated

with study, while the profile was thrust forward as though he were

peering at something just out of sight. A courtly touch in his

style was probably a matter of inheritance, as was also his

capacity for looking suitably attired while obviously neglectful of

appearances. His thick, lank, sandy hair, fading to white, and

long, narrow, stringy beard of the same transitional hue were not

well cared for; and yet they helped to give him a little of the air

of a Titian or Velasquez nobleman. In answer to Guion now, he spoke

without lifting his eyes from his plate.
"Have I been hearing things? N-no; only that the care of big

estates is a matter of great responsibility—and anxiety."
"That's what I tell papa," Miss Guion said, warmly, catching the

concluding words. "It's a great responsibility and anxiety. He

ought to be free from it. I tell him my marriage is a providential

hint to him to give up work."
"Perhaps I sha'n't get the chance. Work may give

up—me."
"I wish it would, papa. Then everything would be settled."
"Some things would be settled. Others might be opened—for

discussion."
If Rodney Temple had not lifted his eyes in another significant

look toward Guion, Davenant would have let these sentences pass

unheeded. As it was, his attention was directed to possible things,

or impossible things, left unsaid. For a second or two he was aware

of an odd suspicion, but he brushed it away as absurd, in view of

the self-assurance with which Guion roused himself at last to enter

into the conversation, which began immediately to turn on persons

of whom Davenant had no knowledge.
The inability to follow closely gave him time to make a few

superficial observations regarding his host. In spite of the fact

that Guion had been a familiar figure to him ever since his

boyhood, he now saw him at really close range for the first time in

years.
What struck him most was the degree to which Guion conserved his

quality of Adonis. Long ago renowned, in that section of American

society that clings to the cities and seaboard between Maine and

Maryland, as a fine specimen of manhood, he was perhaps handsomer

now, with his noble, regular features, his well-trimmed, iron-gray

beard, and his splendid head of iron-gray hair, than he had been in

his youth. Reckoning roughly, Davenant judged him to be sixty. He

had been a personage prominently in view in the group of cities

formed by Boston, Cambridge, and Waverton, ever since Davenant

could remember him. Nature having created Guion an ornament to his

kind, fate had been equally beneficent in ordaining that he should

have nothing to do, on leaving the university, but walk into the

excellent legal practice his grandfather had founded, and his

father had brought to a high degree of honor as well as to a

reasonable pitch of prosperity. It was, from the younger Guion's

point of view, an agreeable practice, concerned chiefly with the

care of trust funds, in which a gentleman could engage without any

rough-and-tumble loss of gentility. It required little or nothing

in the way of pleadings in the courts or disputing in the

market-place, and—especially during the lifetime of the elder

partners—left him leisure for cultivating that graceful

relationship to life for which he possessed aptitudes. It was a

high form of gracefulness, making it a matter of course that he

should figure on the Boards of Galleries of Fine Arts and Colleges

of Music, and other institutions meant to minister to his country's

good through the elevation of its taste.
"It's the sort of thing he was cut out for," Davenant commented

to himself, as his eye traveled from the high-bred face, where

refinement blended with authority, to the essentially gentlemanly

figure, on which the delicately tied cravat sat with the elegance

of an orchid, while the white waistcoat, of the latest and most

youthful cut, was as neatly adjusted to the person as the calyx to

a bud. The mere sight of so much ease and distinction made Davenant

himself feel like a rustic in his Sunday clothes, though he seized

the opportunity of being in such company to enlarge his perception

of the fine points of bearing. It was an improving experience of a

kind which he only occasionally got.
He had an equal sense of the educational value of the

conversation, to which, as it skipped from country to country and

from one important name to another, it was a privilege to be a

listener. His own career—except for his two excursions round

the world, conscientiously undertaken in pursuit of

knowledge—had been so somberly financial that he was frankly,

and somewhat naïvely, curious concerning the people who "did

things" bearing little or no relation to business, and who

permitted themselves sensations merely for the sake of having them.

Olivia Guion's friends, and Drusilla Fane's—admirals,

generals, colonels, ambassadors, and secretaries of embassy they

apparently were, for the most part—had what seemed to him an

unwonted freedom of dramatic action. Merely to hear them talked

about gave him glimpses of a world varied and picturesque, from the

human point of view, beyond his dreams. In the exchange of scraps

of gossip and latest London anecdotes between Miss Guion and

Drusilla Fane, on which Henry Guion commented, Davenant felt

himself to be looking at a vivid but fitfully working

cinematograph, of which the scenes were snatched at random from

life as lived anywhere between Washington and Simla, or Inverness

and Rome. The effect was both instructive and entertaining. It was

also in its way enlightening, since it showed him the true standing

in the world of this woman whom he had once, for a few wild

minutes, hoped to make his wife.
The dinner was half over before he began clearly to detach Miss

Guion from that environment which he would have called "the best

Boston society." Placing her there, he would have said before this

evening that he placed her as high as the reasonable human being

could aspire to be set. For any one whose roots were in Waverton,

"the best Boston society" would in general be taken as the state of

blossoming. It came to him as a discovery, made there and then,

that Olivia Guion had seized this elect state with one of her

earliest tendrils, and, climbing on by way of New York and

Washington, had chosen to do her actual flowering in a cosmopolitan

air.
He had none of the resentment the home-bred American business

man habitually feels for this kind of eccentricity. Now that he had

caught the idea, he could see at a glance, as his mind changed his

metaphor, how admirably she was suited to the tapestried European

setting. He was conscious even of something akin to pride in the

triumphs she was capable of achieving on that richly decorated

world-stage, much as though she were some compatriot prima-donna.

He could see already how well, as the wife of Lieutenant-Colonel

Rupert Ashley, she would fill the part. It had been written for

her. Its strong points and its subtleties were alike of the sort

wherein she would shine.
This perception of his own inward applause explained something

in regard to himself about which he had been wondering ever since

the beginning of dinner—the absence of any pang, of any shade

of envy, to see another man win where he had been so ignominiously

defeated. He saw now that it was a field on which he never

could have won. Within "the best Boston society" he might

have had a chance, though even there it must have been a poor one;

but out here in the open, so to speak, where the prowess and

chivalry of Christendom furnished his competitors, he had been as

little in the running as a mortal at a contest of the gods. That he

was no longer in love with her he had known years ago; but it

palliated somewhat his old humiliation, it made the word failure

easier to swallow down, to perceive that his love, when it existed,

had been doomed, from the nature of things and in advance, to end

in nothing, like that of the nightingale for the moon.

By dwelling too pensively on these thoughts he found he had

missed some of the turns of the talk, his attention awakening to

hear Henry Guion say:
"That's all very fine, but a man doesn't risk everything he

holds dear in the world to go cheating at cards just for the fun of

it. You may depend upon it he had a reason."
"Oh, he had a reason," Mrs. Fane agreed—"the reason of

being hard up. The trouble lay in its not being good enough."
"I imagine it was good enough for him, poor devil."
"But not for any one else. He was drummed out. There wasn't a

soul in the regiment to speak to him. We heard that he took another

name and went abroad. Anyhow, he disappeared. It was all he could

do. He was lucky to get off with that; wasn't he, Peter? wasn't he,

father?"
"What he got off with," said Guion, "was a quality of tragic

interest which never pertains to the people who stick to the Street

called Straight."
"Oh, certainly," Mrs. Fane assented, dryly. "He did acquire

that. But I'm surprised to hear you commend it; aren't you, father?

aren't you, Peter?"
"I'm not commending it," Guion asserted; "I only feel its force.

I've a great deal of sympathy with any poor beggar in

his—downfall."
"Since when?"
The look with which Rodney Temple accompanied the question once

more affected Davenant oddly. It probably made the same impression

on Guion, since he replied with a calmness that seemed studied:

"Since—lately. Why do you ask?"
"Oh, for no reason. It only strikes me as curious that your

sympathy should take that turn."
"Precisely," Miss Guion chimed in. "It's not a bit like you,

papa. You used to be harder on dishonorable things than any

one."
"Well, I'm not now."
It was clear to Davenant by this time that in these words Guion

was not so much making a statement as flinging a challenge. He made

that evident by the way in which he sat upright, squared his

shoulders, and rested a large, white fist clenched upon the table.

His eyes, too, shone, glittered rather, with a light quite other

than that which a host usually turns upon his guests. To Davenant,

as to Mrs. Temple, it seemed as if he had "something on his

mind"—something of which he had a persistent desire to talk

covertly, in the way in which an undetected felon will risk

discovery to talk about the crime.
No one else apparently at the table shared this impression.

Rodney Temple, with eyes pensively downcast, toyed with the seeds

of a pear, while Miss Guion and Mrs. Fane began speaking of some

other incident of what to them was above everything else, "the

Service." A minute or two later Olivia rose.
"Come, Cousin Cherry. Come, Drusilla," she said, with her easy,

authoritative manner. Then, apparently with an attempt to make up

for her neglect of Davenant, she said, as she held the door open

for the ladies to pass: "Don't let them keep you here forever. We

shall be terribly dull till you join us."
He was not too dense to comprehend that the words were

conventional, as the smile she flung him was perfunctory.

Nevertheless, the little attention pleased him.

II
T
he three men being left together, Davenant's

conviction of inner excitement on the part of his host was

deepened. It was as if, on the withdrawal of the ladies, Guion had

less intention of concealing it. Not that at first he said anything

directly or acted otherwise than as a man with guests to entertain.

It was only that he threw into the task of offering liqueurs and

passing cigars a something febrile that caused his two companions

to watch him quietly. Once or twice Davenant caught Temple's eye;

but with a common impulse each hastily looked elsewhere.
"So, Mr. Davenant, you've come back to us. Got here only this

afternoon, didn't you? I wonder why you came. Having got out of a

dull place like Waverton, why should you return to it?"
Looking the more debonair because of the flush in his face and

the gleam in his eye, Guion seated himself in the place his

daughter had left vacant between his two guests. Both his movements

and his manner of speech were marked by a quick jerkiness, which,

however, was not without a certain masculine grace.
"I don't know that I've any better reason," Davenant laughed,

snipping off the end of his cigar, "than that which leads the ox to

his stall—because he knows the way."
"Good!" Guion laughed, rather loudly. Then, stopping abruptly,

he continued, "I fancy you know your way pretty well in any

direction you want to go, don't you?"
"I can find it—if I know where I'm going. I came back to

Boston chiefly because that was just what I didn't know."
"He means," Rodney Temple explained, "that he'd got out of his

beat; and so, like a wise man, he returns to his

starting-point."
"I'd got out of something more than my beat; I'd got out of my

element. I found that the life of elegant leisure on which I'd

embarked wasn't what I'd been cut out for."
"That's interesting—very," Guion said. "How did you make

the discovery?"
"By being bored to death."
"Bored?—with all your money?"
"The money isn't much; but, even if it were, it couldn't go on

buying me a good time."
"That, of course, depends on what your idea of a good time may

be; doesn't it, Rodney?"
"It depends somewhat," Rodney replied, "on the purchasing power

of money. There are things not to be had for cash."
"I'm afraid my conception of a good time," Davenant smiled,

"might be more feasible without the cash than with it. After all,

money would be a doubtful blessing to a bee if it took away the

task of going out to gather honey."
"A bee," Guion observed, "isn't the product of a high and

complex civilization—"
"Neither am I," Davenant declared, with a big laugh. "I spring

from the primitive stratum of people born to work, who expect to

work, and who, when they don't work, have no particular object in

living on."
"And so you've come back to Boston to work?"
"To work—or something."
"You leave yourself, I see, the latitude

of—something."
"Only because it's better than nothing. It's been nothing for so

long now that I'm willing to make it anything."
"Make what—anything?"
"My excuse for remaining on earth. If I'm to go on doing that,

I've got to have something more to justify it than the mere ability

to pay my hotel bill."
"You're luckier than you know to be able to do that much," Guion

said, with one of his abrupt, nervous changes of position. "But

you've been uncommonly lucky, anyhow, haven't you? Made some money

out of that mine business, didn't you? Or was it in sugar?"
Davenant laughed. "A little," he admitted. "But, to any one like

you, sir, it would seem a trifle."
"To any one like me! Listen." He leaned forward, with feverish

eyes, and spoke slowly, tapping on the table-cloth as he did so.

"For half a million dollars I'd sell my soul."
Davenant resisted the impulse to glance at Temple, who spoke

promptly, while Guion swallowed thirstily a glass of cognac.
"That's a good deal for a soul, Henry. It's a large amount of

the sure and tangible for a very uncertain quantity of the

impalpable and problematical."
Davenant laughed at this more boisterously than the degree of

humor warranted. He began definitely to feel that sense of

discomfort which in the last half-hour he had been only afraid of.

It was not the commonplace fact that Guion might be short of money

that he dreaded; it was the possibility of getting a glimpse of

another man's inner secret self. He had been in this position more

than once before—when men wanted to tell him things he didn't

want to know—when, whipped by conscience or crazed by

misfortune or hysterical from drink, they tried to rend with their

own hands the veil that only the lost or the desperate suffer to be

torn. He had noted before that it was generally men like Guion of a

high strung temperament, perhaps with a feminine streak in it, who

reached this pass, and because of his own reserve—his rather

cowardly reserve, he called it—he was always impelled to run

away from them. As there was no possibility of running away now, he

could only dodge, by pretending to misunderstand, what he feared

Guion was trying to say.
"So everything you undertook you pulled off successfully?" his

host questioned, abruptly.
"Not everything; some things. I lost money—often; but on

the whole I made it."
"Good! With me it was always the other way."
The pause that followed was an uneasy one, otherwise Temple

would not have seized on the first topic that came to hand to fill

it up.
"You'll miss Olivia when she's gone, Henry."
"Y-yes; if she goes."
The implied doubt startled Davenant, but Temple continued to

smoke pensively. "I've thought," he said, after a puff or two at

his cigar, "I've thought you seemed to be anticipating something in

the way of a—hitch."
Guion held his cigar with some deliberation over an ash-tray,

knocking off the ash with his little finger as though it were a

task demanding precision.
"You'll know all about it to-morrow, perhaps—or in a few

days at latest. It can't be kept quiet much longer. I got the

impression at dinner that you'd heard something already."
"Nothing but gossip, Henry."
Guion smiled, but with a wince. "I've noticed," he said, "that

there's a certain kind of gossip that rarely gets about unless

there's some cause for it—on the principle of no smoke

without fire. If you've heard anything, it's probably true."
"I was afraid it might be. But in that case I wonder you allowed

Olivia to go ahead."
"I had to let fate take charge of that. When a man gets himself

so entangled in a coil of barbed wire that he trips whichever way

he turns, his only resource is to stand still. That's my case." He

poured himself out another glass of cognac, and tasted it before

continuing. "Olivia goes over to England, and gets herself engaged

to a man I never heard of. Good! She fixes her wedding-day without

consulting me and irrespective of my affairs. Good again! She's old

enough to do it, and quite competent. Meanwhile I lose control of

the machine, so to speak. I see myself racing on to something, and

can't stop. I can only lie back and watch, to see what happens.

I've got to leave that to fate, or God, or whatever it is that

directs our affairs when we can no longer manage them ourselves."

He took another sip of cognac, and pulled for a minute nervously at

his cigar. "I thought at first that Olivia might be married and

get, off before anything happened. Now, it looks to me as if there

was going to be a smash. Rupert Ashley arrives in three or four

days' time, and then—"
"You don't think he'd want to back out, do you?"
"I haven't the remotest idea. From Olivia's description he seems

like a decent sort; and yet—"
Davenant got to, his feet. "Shouldn't you like me to go back to

the ladies? You want to talk to the professor—"
"No, no," Guion said, easily, pushing Davenant into his seat

again. "There's no reason why you shouldn't hear anything I have to

say. The whole town will know it soon. You can't conceal a burning

house; and Tory Hill is on fire. I may be spending my last night

under its roof."
"They'll not rush things like that," Temple said, tying to speak

reassuringly.
"They haven't rushed things as it is. I've come to the end of a

very long tether. I only want you to know that by this time

to-morrow night I may have taken Kipling's Strange Ride with

Morrowby Jukes to the Land of the Living Dead. If I do, I sha'n't

come back—accept bail, or that sort of thing. I can't imagine

anything more ghastly than for a man to be hanging around among his

old friends, waiting for a—for a"—he balked at the

word—"for a trial," he said at last, "that can have only one

ending. No! I'm ready to ride away when they call for me—but

they won't find me pining for freedom."
"Can't anything be done?"
"Not for me, Rodney. If Rupert Ashley will only look after

Olivia, I shan't mind what happens next. Men have been broken on

the wheel before now. I think I can go through it as well as

another. But if Ashley should fail us—and of course that's

possible—well, you see why I feel as I do about her falling

out with the old Marquise. Aunt Vic has always made much of

her—and she's very well off—"
"Is there nothing to be expected in that quarter for

yourself?"
Guion shook his head. "I couldn't ask her—not at the

worst. In the natural course of things Olivia and I would be her

heirs—that is, if she didn't do something else with her

money—but she's still in the early seventies, and may easily

go on for a long time yet. Any help there is very far in the

future, so that—"
"Ashley, I take it, is a man of some means?"
"Of comfortable means—no more. He has an entailed property

in the Midlands and his pay. As he has a mother and two sisters to

pension off, Olivia begged to have no settlements made upon

herself. He wanted to do it, after the English fashion, but I think

she showed good feeling in declining it. Naturally, I approved of

her doing it, knowing how many chances there were that I mightn't

be able to—to play up—myself."
After this conversation Davenant could not but marvel at the

ease with which their host passed the cigars again and urged him

personally to have another glass of Chartreuse. "Then suppose we

join the ladies," he added, when further hospitality was

declined.
Guion took the time to fleck a few specks of cigar-ash from his

shirt-bosom and waistcoat, thus allowing Rodney Temple to pass out

first. When alone with Davenant he laid his hand upon the younger

man's arm, detaining him.
"It was hardly fair to ask you to dinner," he said, still

forcing an unsteady smile, "and let you in for this. I thought at

first of putting you off; but in the end I decided to let you come.

To me it's been a sort of dress-rehearsal—a foretaste of what

it'll be in public. The truth is, I'm a little jumpy. The

rôle's so new to me that it means something to get an idea of

how to play it on nerve. I recall you as a little chap," he added,

in another tone, "when Tom Davenant and his wife first took you.

Got you out of an orphanage, didn't they, or something like that?

If I remember rightly, your name was Hall or Hale—"
"It was Hallett—Peter Hallett."
"Hallett, was it? Well, it will do no harm for a young

Cæsar of finance like you to see what you may come to if

you're not careful. Morituri te salutamus, as the gladiators used

to say. Only I wish it was to be the arena and the sword instead of

the court-room and the Ride with Morrowby Jukes."
Davenant said nothing, not because he had nothing to say, but

because his thoughts were incoherent. Perhaps what was most in the

nature of a shock to him was the sight of a man whom he both

admired for his personality and honored as a pillar of Boston life

falling so tragically into ruin. While it was true that to his

financially gifted mind any misuse of trust funds had the special

heinousness that horse-lifting has to a rancher, yet as he stood

with Guion's hand on his shoulder he knew that something in the

depths of his being was stirred, and stirred violently, that had

rarely been affected before. He had once, as a boy, saved a woman

from drowning; he had once seen a man at an upper window of a

burning house turn back into the fire while the bystanders

restrained him, Davenant, from attempting an impossible rescue.

Something of the same unreasoning impulse rose up within him

now—the impulse to save—the kind of impulse that takes

no account of the merit of the person in peril, seeing only the

danger.
But these promptings were dumb in him for the moment from lack

of co-ordination. The two or three things he might have said seemed

to strangle each other in the attempt to get right of way. In

response to Guion's confidences he could only mumble something

incoherent and pass on to the drawing-room door. It was a wide

opening, hung with portieres, through which he could see Olivia

Guion standing by the crackling wood fire, a foot on the low

fender. One hand rested lightly on the mantelpiece, while the other

drew back her skirt of shimmering black from the blaze. Drusilla

Fane, at the piano, was strumming one of Chopin's more familiar

nocturnes.
He was still thinking of this glimpse when, a half-hour later,

he said to Rodney Temple, as they walked homeward in the moonlight:

"I haven't yet told you what I came back for."
"Well, what is it?"
"I thought—that is, I hoped—that if I did the way

might open up for me to do what might be called—well, a

little good."
"What put that into your head?" was the old man's response to

this stammering confession.
"I suppose the thought occurred to me on general principles.

I've always understood it was the right thing to attempt."
"Oh, right. That's another matter. Doing right is as easy as

drawing breath. It's a habit, like any other. To start out to do

good is much like saying you'll add a cubit to your stature. But

you can always do right. Do right, and the good'll take care of

itself."
Davenant reflected on this in silence as they tramped onward. By

this time they had descended Tory Hill, and were on the dike that

outlines the shores of the Charles.
By a common impulse both Temple and Davenant kept silent

concerning Guion. On leaving Tory Hill they had elected to walk

homeward, the ladies taking the carriage. The radiant moonlight and

the clear, crisp October air helped to restore Davenant's faculties

to a normal waking condition after the nightmare of Guion's hints.

Fitting what he supposed must be the facts into the perspective of

common life, to which the wide, out-of-door prospect offered some

analogy, they were, if not less appalling, at least less

overwhelming. Without seeing what was to be done much more clearly

than he had seen an hour ago, he had a freer consciousness of

power—something like the matter-of-course assumption that any

given situation could be met with which he ordinarily faced the

world. That he lacked authority in the case was a thought that did

not occur to him—no more than it occurred to him on the day

when he rescued the woman from drowning, or on the night when he

had dashed into the fire to save a man.
It was not till they had descended the straggling, tree-shaded

street—along which the infrequent street-lamps threw little

more light that that which came from the windows shining placidly

out on lawns—and had emerged on the embankment bordering the

Charles, that the events of the evening began for Davenant to weave

themselves in with that indefinable desire that had led him back to

Boston. He could not have said in what way they belonged together;

and yet he could perceive that between them there was some such dim

interpenetration as the distant lamps of the city made through the

silvery mist lying on the river and its adjacent marshes like some

efflorescence of the moonlight.
"The difficulty is," he said, after a long silence, "that it's

often so hard to know what is right."
"No, it isn't."
The flat contradiction brought a smile to the young man's lips

as they trudged onward.
"A good many people say so."
"A good many people say foolish things. It's hard to know what's

right chiefly when you're not in a hurry to do it."
"Aren't there exceptions to that rule?"
"I allowed for the exceptions. I said chiefly."
"But when you do want to do it?"
"You'll know what it is. There'll be something to tell you."
"And this something to tell you? What do you call it?"
"Some call it conscience. Some call it God. Some call it

neither."
Davenant reflected again.
"And you? What do you call it?"
"I can't see that anything would be gained by telling you. That

sort of knowledge isn't of much use till it's worked out for

oneself. At least, it wouldn't be of much use to you."
"Why not to me?"
"Because you've started out on your own voyage of discovery.

You'll bring back more treasures from that adventure than any one

can give you."
These things were said crustily, as though dragged from a man

thinking of other matters and unwilling to talk. More minutes went

by before Davenant spoke again.
"But doesn't it happen that what you call the

'something-to-tell-you' tells you now and then to do things that

most people would call rather wild—or crazy?"
"I dare say."
"So what then?"
"Then you do them."
"Oh, but—"
"If there's an 'Oh, but', you don't. That's all. You belong to

the many called, but not to the few chosen."
"But if things are wild—I'm thinking of something

in particular—"
"Then you'd better leave it alone, unless you're prepared to be

considered a wild man. What Paul did was wild—and

Peter—and Joan of Arc—and Columbus—and a good

many others. True they were well punished for their folly. Most of

them were put in irons, and some of them got death."
"I shouldn't dream of classing myself in their company."
"Every one's in their company who feels a big impulse and has

the courage of it. The trouble with most of us is that we can do

the feeling all right; but when it comes to the

execution—well, we like to keep on the safe side, among the

sane."
"So that," Davenant began, stammeringly, "if a fellow got

something into his head—something that couldn't be wrong, you

know—something that would be right—awfully right in its

way, but in a way that most people would consider all

wrong—or wild, as I said before—you'd advise

him—?"
"I shouldn't advise him at all. Some things must be spontaneous,

or they're of little use. If a good seed in good ground won't

germinate of its own accord, words of counsel can't help it. But

here we are at home. You won't come in just yet? Very well; you've

got your latch-key."
"Good-night, sir. I hope you're not going to think

me—well, altogether an idiot."
"Very likely I shall; but it'll be nothing if I do. If you can't

stand a little thing like that you'd better not have come back with

the ideas that have brought you."

III
D
avenant turned away into the moonlit mist.

Through it the electric lamps of Boston, curving in crescent lines

by the water's edge, or sprinkled at random over the hill which the

city climbs, shone for him with the steadiness and quiet comfort

inherent in the familiar and the sure after his long roaming.

Lighting a cigarette, he strode along the cement pavement beside

the iron railing below which the river ran swiftly and soundlessly.

At this late hour of the evening he had the embankment to himself,

save for an occasional pair of lovers or a group of sauntering

students. Lights from the dignified old houses—among which

was Rodney Temple's—overlooking the embankment and the

Charles threw out a pleasant glow of friendliness. Beyond the river

a giant shadow looming through the mist reminded him of the Roman

Colisseum seen in a like aspect, the resemblance being accentuated

in his imagination by the Stadium's vast silence, by its rows upon

rows of ghostly gray sedilia looking down on a haunted, empty ring.

His thoughts strayed to Rome, to Cairo, to Calcutta, to Singapore,

to the stages of those two patient journeys round the world, made

from a sense of duty, in search of a widening of that sheerly human

knowledge which life had hitherto denied him. Having started from

London and got back to London again, he saw how imperfectly he had

profited by his opportunities, how much he had missed. It was

characteristic of him to begin all over again, and more thoroughly,

conscientiously revisiting the Pyramids, the Parthenon, and the Taj

Mahal, endeavoring to capture some of that true spirit of

appreciation of which he read in books.
In his way he was not wholly unsuccessful, since by dint of

steady gazing he heightened his perceptive powers, whether it were

for Notre Dame, the Sistine Madonna, or the Alps, each of which he

took with the same seriousness. What eluded him was precisely that

human element which was the primary object of his quest. He learned

to recognize the beauty of a picture or a mountain more or less at

sight; but the soul of these things, of which he thought more than

of their outward aspects, the soul that looks through the eyes and

speaks with the tongues of peoples, remained inaccessible to his

yearnings. He was always outside—never more than a tourist.

He made acquaintances by the wayside easily enough, but only of the

rootless variety, beginning without an introduction and ending

without a farewell. There was nothing that "belonged" to him,

nothing to which he himself "belonged."
It was the persistency of the defect that had marked most of his

life, even that portion of it spent in Boston and

Waverton—the places he called "home." He was their citizen

only by adoption, as only by adoption he was the son of Tom and

Sarah Davenant. That intimate claim—the claim on the family,

the claim on the soil—which springs of birth and antedates it

was not his, and something had always been lacking to his life

because of the deficiency. Too healthily genial to feel this want

more than obscurely, he nevertheless had tried to remedy it by

resorting to the obvious means. He had tried to fall in love, with

a view to marriage and a family. Once, perhaps twice, he might have

been successful had it not been for the intrusive recollection of a

moment, years before, when a girl whom he knew to be proud without

suspecting how proud she was had in answer to the first passionate

words he ever uttered started to her feet, and, fanning herself

languidly, walked away. The memory of that instant froze on his

tongue words that might have made him happy, sending him back into

his solitary ways. They were ways, as he saw plainly enough, that

led no whither; for which reason he had endeavored, as soon as he

was financially justified, to get out of them by taking a long

holiday and traveling round the world.
He was approaching the end of his second journey when the

realization came to him that as far as his great object was

concerned the undertaking had been a failure. He was as much

outside the broader current of human sympathies as ever. Then, all

at once, he began to see the reason why.
The first promptings to this discovery came to him one spring

evening as he stood on the deck of the steam-launch he had hired at

Shanghai to go up and down the Yangste-Kiang. Born in China, the

son of a medical missionary, he had taken a notion to visit his

birthplace at Hankow. It was a pilgrimage he had shirked on his

first trip to that country, a neglect for which he afterward

reproached himself. All things considered, to make it was as little

as he could do in memory of the brave man and woman to whom he owed

his existence.
Before this visit it must be admitted, Rufus and Corinna

Hallett, his parents according to the flesh, had been as remote and

mythical to the mind of Peter Davenant as the Dragon's Teeth to

their progeny, the Spartans. Merely in the most commonplace kind of

data he was but poorly supplied concerning them. He knew his father

had once been a zealous young doctor in Graylands, Illinois, and

had later become one of the pioneers of medical enterprise in the

mission field; he knew, too, that he had already worked for some

years at Hankow before he met and married Miss Corinna Meecham,

formerly of Drayton, Georgia, but at that time a teacher in a

Chinese school supported by one of the great American churches.

Events after that seemed to have followed rapidly. Within a few

years the babe who was to become Peter Davenant had seen the light,

the mother had died, and the father had perished as the victim of a

rising in the interior of Hupeh. The child, being taken to America,

and unclaimed by relatives, was brought up in the institution

maintained for such cases by the Missionary Board of the church to

which his father and mother had given their services. He had lived

there till, when he was seven years old, Tom and Sarah Davenant,

childless and yet longing for a child, had adopted him.
These short and simple annals furnished all that Davenant knew

of his own origin; but after the visit to Hankow the personality of

his parents at least became more vivid. He met old people who could

vaguely recall them. He saw entries in the hospital records made by

his father's hand. He stood by his mother's grave. As for his

father's grave, if he had one, it was like that of Moses, on some

lonely Nebo in Hupeh known to God alone. In the compound Davenant

saw the spot on which his father's simple house had stood—the

house in which he himself was born—though a wing of the

modern hospital now covered it. It was a relief to him to find

that, except for the proximity of the lepers' ward and the opium

refuge, the place, with its trim lawns, its roses, its clematis,

its azaleas, its wistaria, had the sweetness of an English rectory

garden. He liked to think that Corinna Meecham had been able to

escape from her duties in the crowded, fetid, multi-colored city

right outside the gates to something like peace and decency within

these quiet walls.
He was not a born traveler; still less was he an explorer. At

the end of three days he was glad to take leave of his hosts at the

hospital, and turn his launch down the river toward the

civilization of Shanghai. But it was on the very afternoon of his

departure that the ideas came to him which ultimately took him back

to Boston, and of which he was now thinking as he strolled through

the silvery mist beside the Charles.
He had been standing then on the deck of his steam-launch gazing

beyond the river, with its crowding, outlandish junks, beyond the

towns and villages huddled along the banks, beyond walls gay with

wistaria, beyond green rice-fields stretching into the horizon, to

where a flaming sunset covered half the sky—a sunset which

itself seemed hostile, mysterious, alien, Mongolian. He was

thinking that it was on just this scene that his father and mother

had looked year upon year before his birth. He wondered how it was

that it had had no prenatal influence on himself. He wondered how

it was that all their devotion had ended with themselves, that

their altruism had died when Corinna Meecham's soul had passed-away

and Rufus Hallett, like another Stephen, had fallen on his knees

beneath the missiles of the villagers to whom he was coming with

relief. They had spent their lives in the service of others; he had

spent his in his own. It was curious. If there was anything in

heredity, he ought to have felt at least some faint impulse from

their zeal; but he never had. He could not remember that he had

ever done anything for any one. He could not remember that he had

ever seen the need of it. It was curious. He mused on

it—mused on the odd differences between one generation and

another, and on the queer way in which what is light to the father

will sometimes become darkness in the son.
It was then that he found the question raising itself within

him, "Is that what's wrong with me?"
The query took him by surprise. It was so out of keeping with

his particular kind of self-respect that he found it almost droll.

If he had never given himself to others, as his parents

had, he had certainly paid the world all he owed it. He had nothing

wherewith to reproach himself on that score. It had been a matter

of satisfaction amounting to pride that he had made his bit of

money without resorting in any single instance to methods that

could be considered shady. If complaint or criticism could not

reach him here, it could not reach him anywhere. Therefore the

question as to whether there was anything wrong in his attitude

toward others was so patently absurd that it could easily be

dismissed.
He dismissed it promptly, but it came again. It came repeatedly

during that spring and summer. It forced itself on his attention.

It became, in its way, the recurrent companion of his journey. It

turned up unexpectedly at all sorts of times and in all sorts of

places, and on each occasion with an increased comprehension on his

side of its pertinence. He could look back now and trace the stages

by which his understanding of it had progressed. There was a

certain small happening in a restaurant at Yokohama; there was an

accident on the dock at Vancouver; there was a conversation on a

moonlight evening up at Banff; there was an incident during a drive

in the Yosemite; these were mile-stones on the road by which his

mind had traveled on to seize the fact that the want of touch

between him and his fellow-men might be due to the suppression of

some essentially human force within himself. It came to him that

something might, after all, have been transmitted from Hupeh and

Hankow of which he had never hitherto suspected the existence.
It cannot be said that his self-questioning had produced any

answer more definite than that before he found himself journeying

back toward Boston. The final impulse had been given him while he

was still loitering aimlessly in Chicago by a letter from Mrs.

Temple.
"If you have nothing better to do, dear Peter," she wrote, "we

shall be delighted if you can come to us for a week or two. Dear

Drusilla is with us once again, and you can imagine our joy at

having her. It would seem like old times if you were here to

complete the little circle. The room you used to have in your

college vacations—after dear Tom and Sarah were taken from

us—is all ready for you; and Drusilla would like to know you

were here to occupy it just as much as we."
In accepting this invitation Davenant knew himself to be drawn

by a variety of strands of motive, no one of which had much force

in itself, but which when woven together lent one another strength.

Now that he had come, he was glad to have done it, since in the

combination of circumstances he felt there must be an acknowledged

need of a young man, a strong man, a man capable of shouldering

responsibilities. He would have been astonished to think that that

could be gainsaid.
The feeling was confirmed in him after he had watched the tip of

his smoked-out cigarette drop, like a tiny star, into the current

of the Charles, and had re-entered Rodney Temple's house.
"Here's Peter!"
It was Drusilla's voice, with a sob in it. She was sitting on

the stairs, three steps from the top, huddled into a voluminous

mauve-and-white dressing-gown. In the one dim light burning in the

hall her big black eyes gleamed tragically, as those of certain

animals gleam in dusk.
"Oh, Peter, dear, I'm so glad you've come! The most awful thing

has happened."
That was Mrs. Temple who, wrapped in something fleecy in texture

and pink in hue, was crouched on the lowest step, looking more than

ever like a tea-cozy dropped by accident.
"What's the matter?" Davenant asked, too deeply astonished even

to take off his hat. "Is it burglars? Where's the professor?"
"He's gone to bed. It isn't burglars. I wish it was. It's

something far, far worse. Collins told Drusilla. Oh, I know it's

true—though Rodney wouldn't say so. I simply ...

know ... it's ... true."
"Oh, it's true," Drusilla corroborated. "I knew that the minute

Collins began to speak. It explains everything—all the little

queernesses I've noticed ever since I came home—and

everything."
"What is it?" Peter asked again. "Who's Collins? And what has he

said?"
"It isn't a he; it's a she," Drusilla explained. "She's my maid.

I knew the minute I came into the room that she'd got something on

her mind—I knew it by the way she took my wrapper from the

wardrobe and laid it on the bed. It was too awful!"
"What was too awful? The way she laid your wrapper on the

bed?"
"No; what she told me. And I know it's true."
"Well, for the Lord's sake, Drusilla, what is it?"
Drusilla began to narrate. She had forborne, she said, to put

any questions till she was being "undone"; but in that attitude,

favorable for confidence, she had asked Collins over her shoulder

if anything troubled her, and Collins had told her tale. Briefly,

it was to the effect that some of the most distinguished kitchens

in Boston and Waverton had been divided into two factions, one pro

and the other contra, ever since the day, now three weeks ago, when

Miss Maggie Murphy, whose position of honorable service at Lawyer

Benn's enabled her to profit by the hints dropped at that eminent

man's table, had announced, in the servant's dining-room of Tory

Hill itself, that Henry Guion was "going to be put in jail." He had

stolen Mrs. Clay's money, and Mrs. Rodman's money, "and a lot of

other payple's money, too," Miss Murphy was able to

affirm—clients for whom Guion, Maxwell & Guion had long

acted as trustees—and was now to be tried and sentenced,

Lawyer Benn himself being put in charge of the affair by the

parties wronged. Drusilla described the sinking of her own heart as

these bits of information were given her, though she had not failed

to reprimand Collins for the repetition of foolish gossip. This, it

seemed, had put Collins on her mettle in defense of her own order,

and she had replied that, if it came to that, m'm, the contents of

the waste-paper baskets at Tory Hill, though slightly damaged, had

borne ample testimony to the truth of the tale as Miss Maggie

Murphy told it. If Mrs. Fane required documentary evidence, Collins

herself was in a position to supply it, through the kindness of her

colleagues in Henry Guion's employ.
Davenant listened in silence. "So the thing is out?" was his

only comment.
"It's out—and all over the place," Drusilla answered,

tearfully. "We're the only people who haven't known it—but

it's always that way with those who are most concerned."
"And over three hundred guests invited to Olivia's wedding next

Thursday fortnight! And the British Military Attaché coming

from Washington! And Lord Woolwich from Ottawa! What's to happen

I don't know."
Mrs. Temple raised her hands and let them drop heavily.
"Oh, Peter, can't you do anything?"
"What can he do, child? If Henry's been making away with all

that money it would take a fortune to—"
"Oh, men can do things—in business," Drusilla asserted. "I

know they can. Banks lend them money, don't they, Peter?

Banks are always lending money to tide people over. I've often

heard of it. Oh, Peter, do something. I'm so glad you're

here. It seems like a providence."
"Colonel Ashley will be here next week, too," Mrs. Temple

groaned, as though the fact brought comfort.
"Oh, mother dear, don't speak of him!" Drusilla put up

her two hands, palms outward, before her averted face, as though to

banish the suggestion. "If you'd ever known him you'd see how

impossible—how impossible—this kind of

situation is for a man like him. Poor, poor Olivia! It's impossible

for her, too, I know; but then we Americans—well, we're more

used to things. But one thing is certain, anyhow," she continued,

rising in her place on the stairs and stretching out her hand

oratorically: "If this happens I shall never go back to

Southsea—never, never!—no, nor to Silchester. With my

temperament I couldn't face it. My career will be over. There'll be

nothing left for me, mother dear, but to stay at home with

father and you."
Mrs. Temple rose, sighing heavily. "Well, I suppose we must go

to bed, though I must say it seems harder to do that than almost

anything. None of us'll sleep."
"Oh, Peter, won't you do something?"
Drusilla's hands were clasped beneath an imploring face,

slightly tilted to one side. Her black hair had begun to tumble to

her shoulders.
"I'll—I'll think it over," was all he could find to

answer.
"Oh, thank you, Peter! I must say it seems like a

providence—your being here. With my temperament I always feel

that there's nothing like a big strong man to lean on."
The ladies retired, leaving him to put out the light. For a long

time he stood, as he had entered, just inside the front door

leaning on his stick and wearing his hat and overcoat. He was

musing rather than thinking, musing on the odd way in which he

seemed almost to have been waited for. Then, irrelevantly perhaps,

there shot across his memory the phrases used by Rodney Temple less

than an hour ago:
"Some call it conscience. Some call it God. Some call it

neither. But," he added, slowly, "some do call it

God."

IV
C
losing the door behind his departing guests,

Guion stood for a minute, with his hand still on the knob, pressing

his forehead against the woodwork. He listened to the sound of the

carriage-wheels die away and to the crunching tread of the two men

down the avenue.
"The last Guion has received the last guest at Tory Hill," he

said to himself. "That's all over—all over and done with.

Now!"
It was the hour to which he had been looking forward, first as

an impossibility, then as a danger, and at last as an expectation,

ever since the day, now some years ago, when he began to fear that

he might not be able to restore all the money he had "borrowed"

from the properties in his trust. Having descried it from a long

way off, he knew that with reasonable luck it could not overtake

him soon. There were many chances, indeed, that it might never

overtake him at all. Times might change; business might improve; he

might come in for the money he expected from his old Aunt de

Melcourt; he might die. If none of these things happened, there

were still ways and means by which he might make money in big

strokes and "square himself" without any one ever being the wiser.

He had known of cases, or, at least, he had suspected them, in

which men in precisely his position had averted by daring play the

deadliest peril and gone down into honored graves. Fortune had

generally favored him hitherto, and probably would favor him

again.
So after the first dreadful days of seeing his "mistakes," and,

in his recoil, calling himself by opprobrious names, he began to

get used to his situation and boldly to meet its requirements. That

he would prove equal to them he had scarcely any doubt. It was, in

fact, next to inconceivable that a man of his antecedents and

advantages should be unable to cope with conditions that, after

all, were not wholly exceptional in the sordid history of

business.
He admitted that the affair was sordid, while finding an excuse

for his own connection with it in the involuntary defilement that

comes from touching pitch. It was impossible, he said, for a man of

business not to touch pitch, and he was not a man of business of

his own accord. The state of life had been forced on him. He was a

trustee of other people's property by inheritance, just as a man

becomes a tsar. As a career it was one of the last he would have

chosen. Had he received from his father an ample personal fortune

instead of a mere lucrative practice he would have been a country

gentleman, in the English style, with, of course, a house in town.

Born with a princely aptitude for spending his own money, he felt

it hard that he should have been compelled to make it his life's

work to husband that of others. The fact that he had always, to

some extent been a square man in a round hole seemed to entitle him

to a large share of moral allowance, especially in his judgment on

himself. He emphasized the last consideration, since it enabled

him, in his moments of solitude, to look himself more straightly in

the face. It helped him to buttress up his sense of honor, and so

his sense of energy, to be able to say, "I am still a

gentleman."
He came in time to express it otherwise, and to say, "I must

still play the gentleman." He came to define also what he meant by

the word still. The future presented itself as a

succession of stages, in which this could not happen till that had

happened, nor the final disaster arrive till all the intervening

phases of the situation had been passed. He had passed them. Of

late he had seen that the flames of hell would get hold upon him at

that exact instant when, the last defense having been broken down

and the last shift resorted to, he should turn the key on all

outside hope, and be alone with himself and the knowledge that he

could do no more. Till then he could ward them off, and he had been

fighting them to the latest second. But on coming home from his

office in Boston that afternoon he had told himself that the game

was up. Nothing as far as he could see would give him the respite

of another four and twenty hours. The minutes between him and the

final preparations could be counted with the finger on the

clock.
In the matter of preparation the most important detail would be

to tell Olivia. Hoping against hope that this would never become

necessary, he had put off the evil moment till the postponement had

become cruel. But he had lived through it so often in thought, he

had so acutely suffered with her in imagination the staggering

humiliation of it all, that now, when the time had come, his

feelings were benumbed. As he turned into his own grounds that day

it seemed to him that his deadness of emotion was such that he

could carry the thing through mechanically, as a skilled surgeon

uses a knife. If he found her at tea in the drawing-room he might

tell her then.
He found her at tea, but there were people with her. He was

almost sorry; and yet it keyed him up to see that there was some

necessity "to still play the gentleman." He played it, and played

it well—with much of his old-time ease. The feat was so

extraordinary as to call out a round of mental applause for

himself; and, after all, he reflected, there would be time enough

in the evening.
But tea being over, Miss Guion announced that Mr. and Mrs.

Temple and Drusilla Fane were coming informally to dinner, bringing

with them a guest of theirs, "some one of the name of Davenant."

For an instant he felt that he must ask her to telephone and put

them off, but on second thoughts it seemed better to let them come.

It would be in the nature of a reprieve, not so much for himself as

for Olivia. It would give her one more cheerful evening, the last,

perhaps, in her life. Besides—the suggestion was a vague one,

sprung doubtless of the hysterical element in his suppressed

excitement—he might test his avowals on Temple and Davenant,

getting a foretaste of what it would be to face the world. He

formed no precise intention of doing that; he only allowed his mind

to linger on the luxury of trying it. He had suspected lately that

Rodney Temple knew more of his situation than he had ever told him,

so that the way to speak out would be cleared in advance; and as

for the man of the name of Davenant—probably Tom Davenant's

adopted son, who was said to have pulled off some good things a few

years ago—there would be, in humbling himself before one so

successful, a morbid joy of the kind the devotee may get in being

crushed by an idol.
In this he was not mistaken. While they were there he was able

to draw from his own speeches, covert or open, the relief that

comes to a man in pain from moaning. Now that they were gone,

however, the last extraneous incident that could possibly stand

between him and the beginning of the end had passed. The moment he

had foreseen, as one foresees death, was on him; so, raising his

head from the woodwork of the doorway, he braced himself, and said,

"Now!"
At almost the same instant he heard the rustle of his daughter's

skirts as she came from the drawing-room on her way up-stairs. She

advanced slowly down the broad hail, the lights striking iridescent

rays from the trimmings of her dress. The long train, adding to her

height, enhanced her gracefulness. Only that curious deadness of

sensation of which he had been aware all day—the inability to

feel any more that comes from too much suffering—enabled him

to keep his ground before her. He did keep it, advancing from the

doorway two or three steps toward her, till they met at the foot of

the stairway.
"Have you enjoyed your evening?" were the words he found himself

saying, though they were far from those he had at heart. He felt

that his smile was ghastly; but, as she seemed not to perceive it,

he drew the conclusion that the ghastliness was within.
She answered languidly. "Yes, so so. It might have been

pleasanter if it hadn't been for that awful man."
"Who? Young Davenant? I don't see anything awful about him."
"I dare say there isn't, really—in his place. He may be

only prosy. However," she added, more brightly, "it doesn't matter

for once. Good night, papa dear. You look tired. You ought to go to

bed. I've seen to the windows in the drawing-room, but I haven't

put out the lights."
Having kissed him and patted him on the cheek, she turned to go

up the stairway. He allowed her to ascend a step or two. It was the

minute to speak.
"I'm sorry you feel that way about young Davenant. I rather like

him."
He had not chosen the words. They came out automatically. To

discuss Davenant offered an excuse for detaining her, while

postponing the blow for a few minutes more.
"Oh, men would," she said, indifferently, without turning round.

"He's their style."
"Which is to his discredit?"
"Not to his discredit, but to his disadvantage. I've noticed

that what they call a man's man is generally something of a

bore."
"Davenant isn't a bore."
"Isn't he? Well, I really didn't notice in particular. I only

remember that he used to be about here years ago—and I didn't

like him. I suppose Drusilla has to be civil to him because he was

Cousin Rodney's ward."
She had paused on the landing at the angle of the staircase.
"He's good-looking," Guion said, in continued effort to

interpose the trivial between himself and what he had still to tell

her.
"Oh, that sort of Saxon giant type is always good-looking. Of

course. And dull too."
"I dare say he isn't as dull as you think."
"He might be that, and still remain pretty dull, after the

allowances had been made. I know the type. It's

awful—especially in the form of the American man of

business."
"I'm an American man of business myself."
"Yes; by misadventure. You're the business man made, but not

born. By nature you're a boulevardier, or what the newspapers call

a 'clubman.' I admire you more than I can say—everybody

admires you—for making such a success of a work that must

always have been uncongenial at the least."
The opening was obvious. Nothing could have been more opportune.

Two or three beginnings presented themselves, and as he hesitated,

choosing between them, he moistened his lips and wiped the cold

perspiration from his brow. After all, the blessed apathy within

him was giving way and going to play him false! He had a minute of

feeling as the condemned man must feel when he catches sight of the

guillotine.
Before his parched tongue could formulate syllables she mounted

another step or two of the staircase, and turned again, leaning on

the banister and looking over. He noticed—by a common trick

of the perceptive powers at crises of anguish—how the slender

white pilasters, carved and twisted in sets of four, in the fashion

of Georgian houses like Tory Hill, made quaint, graceful lines up

and down the front of her black gown.
"It's really true—what I say about business, papa," she

pursued. "I'm very much in earnest, and so is Rupert. I do wish

you'd think of that place near Heneage. It will be so lovely for me

to feel you're there; and there can't be any reason for your going

on working any longer."
"No; there's no reason for that," he managed to say.
"Well then?" she demanded, with an air of triumph. "It's just as

I said. You owe it to every one, you owe it to me, you owe it to

yourself above all, to give up. It might have been better if you'd

done it long ago."
"I couldn't," he declared, in a tone that sounded to his own

ears as a cry. "I tried to, ... but things were so involved ...

almost from the first...."
"Well, as long as they're not involved now there's no reason why

it shouldn't be better late than never."
"But they are involved now," he said, with an intensity

so poignant that he was surprised she didn't notice it.
"Then straighten them out. Isn't that what we've been saying all

along, Cousin Rodney and I? Take a partner; take two partners.

Cousin Rodney says you should have done it when Mr. Maxwell died,

or before—"
"I couldn't.... Things weren't shipshape enough ... not even

then."
"I'm sure it could be managed," she asserted, confidently; "and

if you don't do it now, papa, when I'm being married and going away

for good, you'll never do it at all. That's my fear. I don't want

to live over there without you, papa; and I'm afraid that's what

you're going to let me in for." She moved from the banister, and

continued her way upward, speaking over her shoulder as she

ascended. "In the mean time, you really must go to bed.

You look tired and rather pale—just as I do after a dull

party. Good night; and don't stay up."
She reached the floor above, and went toward her room. He felt

strangled, speechless. There was a sense of terror too in the

thought that his nerve, the nerve on which he had counted so much,

was going to fail him.
"Olivia!"
His voice was so sharp that she hurried back to the top of the

stairs.
"What is it, papa? Aren't you well?"
It was the sight of her face, anxious and suddenly white,

peering down through the half-light of the hall that finally

unmanned him. With a heart-sick feeling he turned away from the

stairway.
"Yes; I'm all right. I only wanted you to know that ... that ...

I shall be working rather late. You mustn't be disturbed ... if you

hear me moving about."
He would have upbraided himself more bitterly for his cowardice

had he not found an excuse in the thought that, after all, there

would be time in the morning. It was best that she should have the

refreshment of the night. The one thing important was that she

should not have the shock of learning from others on the morrow

that he was not coming back—that he was going to Singville.

Should he go there at all, he was determined to stay. Since he had

no fight to put up, it was better that his going should be once for

all. The thought of weeks, of months, perhaps, of quasi-freedom,

during which he should be parading himself "on bail," was far more

terrible to him than that of prison. He must prepare her for the

beginning of his doom at all costs to himself; but, he reasoned,

she would be more capable of taking the information calmly in the

daylight of the morning than now, at a few minutes of midnight.
It was another short reprieve, enabling him to give all his

attention to the tasks before him. If he was not to come back to

Tory Hill he must leave his private papers there, his more intimate

treasures, in good order. Certain things would have to be put away,

others rearranged, others destroyed. For the most part they were in

the library, the room he specially claimed as his own. Before

setting himself to the work there he walked through some of the

other rooms, turning out the lights.
In doing so he was consciously taking a farewell. He had been

born in this house; in it he had spent his boyhood; to it he had

come back as a young married man. He had lived in it till his wife

and he had set up their more ambitious establishment in Boston, an

extravagance from which, perhaps, all the subsequent misfortunes

could be dated. He had known at the time that his father, had he

lived, would have condemned the step; but he himself was a believer

in fortunate chances. Besides, it was preposterous for a young

couple of fashion to continue living in a rambling old house that

belonged to neither town nor country, at a time when the whole

trend of life was cityward. They had discussed the move, with its

large increase of expenditure, from every point of view, and found

it one from which, in their social position, there was no escape.

It was a matter about which they had hardly any choice.
So, too, a few years later, with the taking of the cottage at

Newport. It was forced on them. When all their friends were doing

something of the sort it seemed absurd to hesitate because of a

mere matter of means—especially when by hook or by crook the

means could be procured. Similar reasoning had attended their

various residences abroad—in London, Paris, Rome.

Country-houses in England or villas on the Riviera became matters

of necessity, according to the demands of Olivia's entry into the

world of fashion or Mrs. Guion's health.
It was not till the death of the latter, some seven years ago,

that Guion, obliged to pause, was able to take cognizance of the

degree to which he had imperiled himself in the years of effort to

maintain their way of life. It could not be said that at the time

he regretted what he had done, but he allowed it to frighten him

into some ineffectual economies. He exchanged the cottage at

Newport for one at Lenox, and, giving up the house in Boston,

withdrew to Tory Hill. Ceasing himself to go into society, he sent

his daughter abroad for a large portion of her time, either in the

care of Madame de Melcourt or, in London, under the wing of some of

the American ladies prominent in English life.
Having taken these steps, with no small pride in his capacity

for sacrifice, Guion set himself seriously to reconstruct his own

fortune and to repair the inroads he had made on those in his

trust. It was a matter in which he had but few misgivings as to his

capacity. The making of money, he often said, was an easy thing, as

could be proved by the intellectual grade of the men who made it.

One had only to look about one to see that they were men in whom

the average of ability was by no means high, men who achieved their

successes largely by a kind of rule of thumb. They got the knack of

investment—and they invested. He preferred the word

investment to another which might have challenged comment. They

bought in a low market and sold in a high one—and the trick

was done. Some instinct—a flair, he called

it—was required in order to recognize, more or less at sight,

those properties which would quickly and surely appreciate in

value; and he believed he possessed it. Given the control of a few

thousands as a point of departure, and the financial ebb and flow,

a man must be a born fool, he said, not to be able to make a

reasonable fortune with reasonable speed.
Within the office of Guion, Maxwell & Guion circumstances

favored the accession to power of the younger partner, who had

hitherto played an acquiescent rather than an active part. Mr.

Maxwell was old and ailing, though neither so ailing nor so old as

to be blind to the need of new blood, new money, and new influence

in the fine old firm. His weakness was that he hated beginning all

over again with new men; so that when Smith and Jones were proposed

as possible partners he easily admitted whatever objections Guion

raised to them, and the matter was postponed. It was postponed

again. It slipped into a chronic condition of postponement; and Mr.

Maxwell died.
The situation calling then for adroitness on Guion's part, the

fact that he was able to meet it to the satisfaction of all the

parties concerned, increased his confidence in his own astuteness.

True, it required some manipulation, some throwing of dust into

people's eyes, some making of explanations to one person that could

not be reconciled with those made to another; but here again the

circumstances helped him. His clients were for the most part widows

and old maids, many of them resident abroad, for whom Guion,

Maxwell & Guion had so long stood, in the matter of income, for

the embodiment of paternal care that they were ready to believe

anything and say anything and sign anything they were told to. With

the legal authorities to whom he owed account he had the advantage

of the house's high repute, making it possible to cover with

formalities anything that might, strictly speaking, have called for

investigation. Whatever had to be considered shifty he excused to

himself on the ground of its being temporary; while it was clearly,

in his opinion, to the ultimate advantage of the Clay heirs and the

Rodman heirs and the Compton heirs and all the other heirs for whom

Guion, Maxwell & Guion were in loco parentis, that he

should have a free hand.
The sequel astonished rather than disillusioned him. It wrought

in him disappointment with the human race, especially as

represented by the Stock Exchange, without diminishing his

confidence in his own judgment. Through all his wild efforts not to

sink he was upborne by the knowledge that it was not his

calculations that were wrong, but the workings of a system more

obscure than that of chance and more capricious than the weather.

He grew to consider it the fault of the blind forces that make up

the social, financial, and commercial worlds, and not his own, when

he was reduced to a frantic flinging of good money after bad as

offering the sole chance of working out his redemption.
And, now that it was all over, he was glad his wife had not

lived to see the end. That, at least, had been spared him. He stood

before her portrait in the drawing-room—the much-admired

portrait by Carolus Duran—and told her so. She was so living

as she looked down on him—a suggestion of refined irony about

the lips and eyes giving personality to the delicate oval of the

face—that he felt himself talking to her as they had been

wont to talk together ever since their youth. In his way he had

stood in awe of her. The assumption of prerogative—an

endowment of manner or of temperament, he was never quite sure

which—inherited by Olivia in turn, had been the dominating

influence in their domestic life. He had not been ruled by

her—the term would have been grotesque—he had only made

it his pleasure to carry out her wishes. That her wishes led him on

to spending money not his own was due to the fact, ever to be

regretted, that his father had not bequeathed him money so much as

the means of earning it. She could not be held responsible for

that, while she was the type of woman to whom it was something like

an outrage not to offer the things befitting to her station. There

was no reproach in the look he lifted on her now—nothing but

a kind of dogged, perverse thankfulness that she should have had

the way of life she craved, without ever knowing the price he was

about to pay for it.
In withdrawing his glance from hers he turned it about on the

various objects in the room. Many of them had stood in their places

since before he was born; others he had acquired at occasional

sales of Guion property, so that, as the different branches of the

family became extinct or disappeared, whatever could be called

"ancestral" might have a place at Tory Hill; others he had

collected abroad. All of them, in these moments of

anguish—the five K'ang-hsi vases on the mantelpiece, brought

home by some seafaring Guion of Colonial days, the armorial

"Lowestoft" in the cabinets, the Copley portraits of remote

connections on the walls, the bits of Chippendale and Hepplewhite

that had belonged to the grandfather who built Tory Hill—all

of them took on now a kind of personality, as with living look and

utterance. He had loved them and been proud of them; and as he

turned out the lights, leaving them to darkness, eyes could not

have been more appealing nor lips more eloquent than they in their

mute farewell.
Returning to the library, he busied himself with his main

undertaking. He was anxious that nothing should be left behind that

could give Olivia additional pain, while whatever she might care to

have, her mother's letters to himself or other family documents,

might be ready to her hand. It was the kind of detail to which he

could easily give his attention. He worked methodically and

phlegmatically, steeling himself to a grim suppression of regret.

He was almost sorry to finish the task, since it forced his mind to

come again face to face with facts. The clock struck two as he

closed the last drawer and knew that that part of his preparation

was completed.
In reading the old letters with their echoes of old incidents,

old joys, old jokes, old days in Paris, Rome, or England, he had

been so wafted back to another time that on pushing in the drawer,

which closed with a certain click of finality, the realization of

the present rolled back on his soul with a curious effect of

amazement. For a few minutes it was as if he had never understood

it, never thought of it, before. They were going to make him, Henry

Guion, a prisoner, a criminal, a convict! They were going to clip

his hair, and shave his beard, and dress him in a hideous garb, and

shut him in a cell! They were going to give him degrading work to

do and degrading rules to keep, and degrading associates to live

with, as far as such existence could be called living with any one

at all. They were going to do this for year upon year, all the rest

of his life, since he never could survive it. He was to have

nothing any more to come in between him and his own

thoughts—his thoughts of Olivia brought to disgrace, of the

Clay heirs brought to want, of the Rodman heirs and the Compton

heirs deprived of half their livelihood! He had called it that

evening the Strange Ride with Morrowby Jukes to the Land of the

Living Dead, but it was to be worse than that. It was to be worse

than Macbeth with his visions of remorse; it was to be worse than

Vathek with the flame burning in his heart; it was to be worse than

Judas—who at least could hang himself.
He got up and went to a mirror in the corner of the room. The

mere sight of himself made the impossible seem more impossible. He

was so fine a specimen—he could not but know it!—so

much the free man, the honorable man, the man of the world! He

tried to see himself with his hair clipped and his beard shaven and

the white cravat and waistcoat replaced by the harlequin costume of

the jailbird. He tried to see himself making his own bed, and

scrubbing his own floor, and standing at his cell door with a tin

pot in his hand, waiting for his skilly. It was so absurd, so out

of the question, that he nearly laughed outright. He was in a

dream—in a nightmare! He shook himself, he pinched himself,

in order to wake up. He was ready in sudden rage to curse the

handsome, familiar room for the persistence of its reality, because

the rows of books and the Baxter prints and the desks and chairs

and electric lights refused to melt away like things in a troubled

sleep.
It was then that for the first time he began to taste the real

measure of his impotence. He was in the hand of the law. He was in

the grip of the sternest avenging forces human society could set in

motion against him; and, quibbles, shifts, and subterfuges swept

aside, no one knew better than himself that his punishment would be

just.
It was a strange feeling, the feeling of having put himself

outside the scope of mercy. But there he was! There could never be

a word spoken in his defense, nor in any one's heart a throb of

sympathy toward him. He had forfeited everything. He could expect

nothing from any man, and from his daughter least of all. The

utmost he could ask for her was that she should marry, go away, and

school herself as nearly as might be to renounce him. That she

should do it utterly would not be possible; but something would be

accomplished if pride or humiliation or resentment gave her the

spirit to carry her head high and ignore his existence.
It was incredible to think that at that very instant she was

sleeping quietly, without a suspicion of what was awaiting her.

Everything was incredible—incredible and impossible. As he

looked around the room, in which every book, every photograph,

every pen and pencil, was a part of him, he found himself once more

straining for a hope, catching at straws. He took a sheet of paper,

and sitting down at his desk began again, for the ten thousandth

time, to balance feverishly his meagre assets against his

overwhelming liabilities. He added and subtracted and multiplied

and divided with a sort of frenzy, as though by dint of sheer

forcing the figures he could make them respond to his will.
Suddenly, with a gesture of mingled anger and hopelessness, he

swept the scribbled sheets and all the writing paraphernalia with a

crash to the floor, and, burying his face in his hands, gave

utterance to a smothered groan. It was a cry, not of surrender, but

of protest—of infinite, exasperated protest, of protest

against fate and law and judgment and the eternal principles of

right and wrong, and against himself most of all. With his head

pressed down on the bare polished wood of his desk, he hurled

himself mentally at an earth of adamant and a heaven of brass,

hurled himself ferociously, repeatedly, with a kind of doggedness,

as though he would either break them down or dash his own soul to

pieces.
"O God! O God!"
It was an involuntary moan, stifled in his fear of becoming

hysterical, but its syllables arrested his attention. They were the

syllables of primal articulation, of primal need, condensing the

appeal and the aspiration of the world. He repeated them:
"O God! O God!"
He repeated them again. He raised his head, as if listening to a

voice.
"O God! O God!"
He continued to sit thus, as if listening.
It was a strange, an astounding thought to him that he might

pray. Though the earth of adamant were unyielding, the heaven of

brass might give way!
He dragged himself to his feet.
He believed in God—vaguely. That is, it had always been a

matter of good form with him to go to church and to call for the

offices of religion on occasions of death or marriage. He had

assisted at the saying of prayers and assented to their contents.

He had even joined in them himself, since a liturgical service was

a principle in the church to which he "belonged." All this,

however, had seemed remote from his personal affairs, his

life-and-death struggles—till now. Now, all at once, queerly,

it offered him something—he knew not what. It might be

nothing better than any of the straws he had been clutching at. It

might be no more than the effort he had just been making to compel

two to balance ten.
He stood in the middle of the room under the cluster of electric

lights and tried to recollect what he knew, what he had heard, of

this Power that could still act when human strength had reached its

limitations. It was nothing very definite. It consisted chiefly of

great phrases, imperfectly understood: "Father Almighty," "Saviour

of the World," "Divine Compassion" and such like. He did not reason

about them, or try to formulate what he actually believed. It was

instinctively, almost unconsciously, that he began to speak; it was

brokenly and with a kind of inward, spiritual hoarseness. He

scarcely knew what he was doing when he found himself saying,

mentally:
"Save me!... I'm helpless!... I'm desperate!... Save me!... Work

a miracle!... Father!... Christ! Christ! Save my daughter!... We

have no one—but—but You!... Work a miracle! Work a

miracle!... I'm a thief and a liar and a traitor—but save me!

I might do something yet—something that might render

me—worth salvation—but then—I might not....

Anyhow, save me!... O God! Father Almighty!... Almighty! That means

that You can do anything!... Even now—You can

do—anything!... Save us!... Save us all!... Christ! Christ!

Christ!"

He knew neither when nor how he ceased, any more than when or

how he began. His most clearly defined impression was that of his

spirit coming back from a long way off to take perception of the

fact that he was still standing under the cluster of electric

lights and the clock was striking three. He was breathless,

exhausted. His most urgent physic need was that of air. He strode

to the window-door leading out to the terraced lawn, and, throwing

it open, passed out into the darkness.
There was no mist at this height above the Charles. The night

was still, and the moon westering. The light had a glimmering,

metallic essence, as from a cosmic mirror in the firmament. Long

shadows of trees and shrubbery lay across the grass. Clear in the

moonlit foreground stood an elm, the pride of Tory

Hill—springing as a single shaft for twice the measure of a

man—springing and spreading there into four giant branches,

each of which sprang and spread higher into eight—so

springing and spreading, springing and spreading

still—rounded, symmetrical, superb—till the long

outermost shoots fell pendulous, like spray from a fountain of

verdure. The silence held the suggestion of mighty spiritual things

astir. At least the heaven was not of brass, if the earth continued

to be of adamant. On the contrary, the sky was high, soft, dim,

star-bestrewn, ineffable. It was spacious; it was free; it was the

home of glorious things; it was the medium of the eternal.
He was not reassured; he was not even comforted; what relief he

got came only from a feeling—a fancy, perhaps—that the

weight had been eased, that he was freed for a minute from the

crushing pressure of the inevitable. It would return again and

break him down, but for the moment it was lifted, giving him room

and power to breathe. He did breathe—long deep draughts of

the cool night air that brought refreshment and something like

strength to struggle on.
He came back into the room. His pens and papers were scattered

on the floor, and ink from the overturned inkstand was running out

on the Oriental rug. It was the kind of detail that before this

evening would have shocked him; but nothing mattered now. He was

too indifferent to lift his hand and put the inkstand back into its

place. Instead, he threw himself on a couch, turning his face to

the still open window and drinking in with thirsty gasps the

blessed, revivifying air.

V
G
uion awoke in a chill, gray light, to find

himself covered with a rug, and his daughter, wrapped in a white

dressing-gown, bending above him. Over her shoulder peered the

scared face of a maid. His first sensation was that he was cold,

his first act to pull the rug more closely about him. His struggle

back to waking consciousness was the more confused because of the

familiar surroundings of the library.
"Oh, papa, what's the matter?"
He threw the coverlet from him and dragged himself to a sitting

posture.
"What time is it?" he asked, rubbing his eyes. "I must have

dropped off to sleep. Is dinner ready?"
"It's half-past six in the morning, papa dear. Katie found you

here when she came in to dust the room. The window was wide open

and all these things strewn about the floor. She put the rug on you

and came to wake me. What is it? What's happened? Let me send for

the doctor."
With his elbow on his knee, he rested his forehead on his hand.

The incidents of the night came back to him. Olivia seated herself

on the couch beside him, an arm across his shoulder.
"I'm cold," was all he said.
"Katie, go and mix something hot—some whisky or brandy and

hot water—anything! And you, papa dear, go to bed. I'll call

Reynolds and he'll help you."
"I'm cold," he said again.
Rising, he crawled to the mirror into which he had looked last

night, shuddering at sight of his own face. The mere fact that he

was still in his evening clothes, the white waistcoat wrinkled and

the cravat awry, shocked him inexpressibly.
"I'm cold," he said for the third time.
But when he had bathed, dressed, and begun his breakfast, the

chill left him. He regained the mastery of his thoughts and the

understanding of his position. A certain exaltation of suffering

which had upheld him during the previous night failed him, however,

now, leaving nothing but a sense of flat, commonplace misery.

Thrown into relief by the daylight, the facts were more

relentless—not easier of acceptance.
As he drank his coffee and tried to eat he could feel his

daughter watching him from the other end of the table. Now and then

he screened himself from her gaze by pretending to skim the morning

paper. Once he was startled. Reflected in the glass of a picture

hanging on the opposite wall he caught the image of a man in a blue

uniform, who mounted the steps and rang the door-bell.
"Who's that?" he asked, sharply. He dared not turn round to

see.
"It's only the postman, papa darling. Who else should it

be?"
"Yes; of course." He breathed again. "You mustn't mind me, dear.

I'm nervous. I'm—I'm not very well."
"I see you're not, papa. I saw it last night. I knew something

was wrong."
"There's something—very wrong."
"What is it? Tell me."
Leaning on the table, with clasped hands uplifted, the loose

white lace sleeves falling away from her slender wrists, she looked

at him pleadingly.
"We've—that is, I've—lost a great deal of

money."
"Oh!" The sound was just above her breath. Then, after long

silence, she asked: "Is it much?"
He waited before replying, seeking, for the last time, some

mitigation of what he had to tell her.
"It's all we have."
"Oh!" It was the same sound as before, just audible—a

sound with a little surprise in it, a hint of something awed, but

without dismay.
He forced himself to take a few sips of coffee and crumble a bit

of toast.
"I don't mind, papa. If that's what's troubling you so much,

don't let it any longer. Worse things have happened than that." He

gulped down more coffee, not because he wanted it, but to

counteract the rising in his throat. "Shall we have to lose Tory

Hill?" she asked, after another silence.
He nodded an affirmative, with his head down.
"Then you mean me to understand what you said just

now—quite literally. We've lost all we have."
"When everything is settled," he explained, with an effort, "we

shall have nothing at all. It will be worse than that, since I

sha'n't be able to pay all I owe."
"Yes; that is worse," she assented, quietly.
Another silence was broken by his saying, hoarsely:
"You'll get married—"
"That will have to be reconsidered."
"Do you mean—on your part?"
"I suppose I mean—on everybody's part?"
"Do you think he would want to—you must excuse the crudity

of the question—do you think he would want to back out?"
"I don't know that I could answer that. It isn't quite to the

point. Backing out, as you call it, wouldn't be the

process—whatever happened."
He interrupted her nervously. "If this should fall through,

dear, you must write to your Aunt Vic. You must eat humble pie. You

were too toplofty with her as it was. She'll take you."
"Take me, papa? Why shouldn't I stay with you? I'd much

rather."
He tried to explain. It was clearly the moment at which to do

it.
"I don't think you understand, dear, how entirely everything has

gone to smash. I shall probably—I may say, certainly—I

shall have to—to go—"
"I do understand that. But it often happens—especially in

this country—that things go to smash, and then the people

begin again. There was Lulu Sentner's father. They lost everything

they had—and she and her sisters did dressmaking. But he

borrowed money, and started in from the beginning, and now they're

very well off once more. It's the kind of thing one hears of

constantly—in this country."
"You couldn't hear of it in my case, dear, because—well,

because I've done all that. I've begun again, and begun again. I've

used up all my credit—all my chances. The things I counted on

didn't come off. You know that that happens sometimes, don't

you?—without any one being to blame at all?"
She nodded. "I think I've heard so."
"And now," he went on, eager that she should begin to see what

he was leading her up to—"and now I couldn't borrow a

thousand dollars in all Boston, unless it was from some one who

gave it to me as a charity. I've borrowed from every

one—every penny for which I could offer security—and I

owe—I owe hundreds of thousands. Do you see now how bad it

is?"
"I do see how bad it is, papa. I admit it's worse than I

thought. But all the same I know that when people have high

reputations other people trust them and help them through. Banks do

it, don't they? Isn't that partly what they're for? It was

Pierpoint & Hargous who helped Lulu Sentner's father. They

stood behind him. She told me so. I'm positive that with your name

they'd do as much for you. You take a gloomy outlook because you're

ill. But there's no one in Boston—no one in New

England—more esteemed or trusted. When one can say, 'All is

lost save honor,' then, relatively speaking, there's very little

lost at all."
He got up from the table and went to his room. After these words

it was physically impossible for him to tell her anything more. He

had thought of a means which might bring the fact home to her

through the day by a process of suggestion. Packing a small bag

with toilet articles and other necessaries, he left it in a

conspicuous place.
"I want Reynolds to give it to my messenger in case I send for

it," he explained to her, when he had descended to the dining-room

again.
She was still sitting where he left her, at the head of the

table, pale, pensive, but not otherwise disturbed.
"Does that mean that you're not coming home to-night?"
"I—I don't know. Things may happen to—to prevent

me."
"Where should you go?—to New York?"
"No; not to New York."
He half hoped she would press the question, but when she spoke

it was only to say:
"I hope you'll try to come home, because I'm sure you're not

well. Of course I understand it, now I know you've had so much to

upset you. But I wish you'd see Dr. Scott. And, papa," she added,

rising, "don't have me on your mind—please don't. I'm quite

capable of facing the world without money. You mayn't believe it,

but I am. I could do it—somehow. I'm like you. I've a great

deal of self-reliance, and a great deal of something else—I

don't quite know what—that has never been taxed or called on.

It may be pride, but it isn't only pride. Whatever it is, I'm

strong enough to bear a lot of trouble. I don't want you to think

of me at all in any way that will worry you."
She was making it so hard for him that he kissed her hastily and

went away. Her further enlightenment was one more detail that he

must leave, as he had left so much else, to fate or God to take

care of. For the present he himself had all he could attend to.
Half-way to the gate he turned to take what might prove his last

look at the old house. It stood on the summit of a low, rounded

hill, on the site made historic as the country residence of

Governor Rodney. Governor Rodney's "Mansion" having been sacked in

the Revolution by his fellow-townsmen, the neighborhood fell for a

time into disrepute under the contemptuous nickname of Tory Hill.

On the restoration of order the property, passed by purchase to the

Guions, in whose hands, with a continuity not customary in America,

it had remained. The present house, built by Andrew Guion, on the

foundations of the Rodney Mansion, in the early nineteenth century,

was old enough according to New England standards to be venerable;

and, though most of the ground originally about it had long ago

been sold off in building-lots, enough remained to give an

impression of ample outdoor space. Against the blue of the October

morning sky the house, with its dignified Georgian lines, was not

without a certain stateliness—rectangular, three-storied,

mellow, with buff walls, buff chimneys, white doorways, white

casements, white verandas, a white balustrade around the top, and a

white urn at each of the four corners. Where, as over the verandas,

there was a bit of inclined roof, russet-red tiles gave a warmer

touch of color. From the borders of the lawn, edged with a line of

shrubs, the town of Waverton, merging into Cambridge, just now a

stretch of crimson-and-orange woodland, where gables, spires, and

towers peeped above the trees, sloped gently to the ribbon of the

Charles. Far away, and dim in the morning haze, the roofed and

steepled crest of Beacon Hill rose in successive ridges, to cast up

from its highest point the gilded dome of the State House as

culmination to the sky-line. Guion looked long and hard, first at

the house, then at the prospect. He walked on only when he

remembered that he must reserve his forces for the day's

possibilities, that he must not drain himself of emotion in

advance. If what he expected were to come to pass, the first

essential to his playing the man at all would lie in his keeping

cool.
So, on reaching his office, he brought all his knowledge of the

world into play, to appear without undue self-consciousness before

his stenographer, his bookkeeper, and his clerks. The ordeal was

the more severe because of his belief that they were conversant

with the state of his affairs. At least they knew enough to be

sorry for him—of that he was sure; though there was nothing

on this particular morning to display the sympathy, unless it was

the stenographer's smile as he passed her in the anteroom, and the

three small yellow chrysanthemums she had placed in a glass on his

desk. In the nods of greeting between him and the men there was, or

there seemed to be, a studied effort to show nothing at all.
Once safely in his own office, he shut the door with a sense of

relief in the seclusion. It crossed his mind that he should feel

something of the same sort when locked in the privacy of his cell

after the hideous publicity of the trial. From habit as well as

from anxiety he went straight to a mirror and surveyed himself

again. Decidedly he had changed since yesterday. It was not so much

that he was older or more care-worn—he was different. Perhaps

he was ill. He felt well enough, except for being tired,

desperately tired; but that could be accounted for by the way in

which he had spent the night. He noticed chiefly the ashy tint of

his skin, the dullness of his eyes, and—notwithstanding the

fact that his clothes were of his usual fastidiousness—a

curious effect of being badly dressed more startling to him than

pain. He was careful to brush his beard and twist his long mustache

into its usual upward, French-looking curve, so as to regain as

much as possible the air of his old self, before seating himself at

his desk to look over his correspondence. There was a pile of

letters, of which he read the addresses slowly without opening any

of them.
What was the use? He could do nothing. He had come to the end.

He had exhausted all the possibilities of the situation. Besides,

his spirit was broken. He could feel it. Something snapped last

night within him that would never be whole, never even be mended,

again. It was not only the material resources under his control

that he had overtaxed, but the spring of energy within himself,

leaving him no more power of resilience.
An hour may have passed in this condition of dull suspense, when

he was startled by the tinkle of his desk telephone. It was with

some effort that he leaned forward to answer the call. Not that he

was afraid—now; he only shrank from the necessity of doing

anything.
"Mr. Davenant would like to see you," came the voice of the

stenographer from the anteroom.
There was nothing to reply but, "Ask Mr. Davenant to come in."

He uttered the words mechanically. He had not thought of Davenant

since he talked with Olivia on the stairs—a conversation that

now seemed a curiously long time ago.
"I hope I'm not disturbing you, Mr. Guion," the visitor said,

apologetically, with a glance at the letters on the desk.
"Not at all, my dear fellow," Guion said, cordially, from force

of habit, offering his hand without rising from the revolving

chair. "Sit down. Have a cigar. It's rather a sharp morning for the

time of year."
The use of the conventional phrases of welcome helped him to

emerge somewhat from his state of apathy. Davenant declined the

cigar, but seated himself near the desk, in one of the round-backed

office chairs. Not being a man easily embarrassed by silences, he

did not begin to speak at once, and during the minute his

hesitation lasted Guion bethought him of Olivia's remark, "That

sort of Saxon-giant type is always good-looking." Davenant

was good-looking, in a clear-skinned, clear-eyed way.

Everything about him spoke of straight-forwardness and strength,

tempered perhaps by the boyish quality inseparable from fair hair,

a clean, healthily ruddy complexion, and a direct blue glance that

rested on men and things with a kind of pensive wondering. All the

same, the heavy-browed face on a big, tense neck had a frowning,

perhaps a lowering expression that reminded Guion of a young bull

before he begins to charge. The lips beneath the fair mustache

might be too tightly and too severely compressed, but the smile

into which they broke over regular white teeth was the franker and

the more engaging because of the unexpected light. If there was any

physical awkwardness about him, it was in the management of his

long legs; but that difficulty was overcome by his simplicity. It

was characteristic of Guion to notice, even at such a time as this,

that Davenant was carefully and correctly dressed, like a man

respectful of social usages.
"I came in to see you, Mr. Guion," he began, apparently with

some hesitation, "about what we were talking of last night."
Guion pulled himself together. His handsome eyebrows arched

themselves, and he half smiled.
"Last night? What were we talking of?"
"We weren't talking of it, exactly. You only told us."
"Only told you—what?" The necessity to do a little fencing

brought some of his old powers into play.
"That you wanted to borrow half a million dollars. I've come in

to—to lend you that sum—if you'll take it."
For a few seconds Guion sat rigidly still, looking at this man.

The import and bearing of the words were too much for him to grasp

at once. All his mind was prepared to deal with on the spur of the

moment was the fact of this offer, ignoring its application and its

consequences as things which for the moment lay outside his range

of thought.
As far as he was able to reflect, it was to assume that there

was more here than met the eye. Davenant was too practised as a

player of "the game" to pay a big price for a broken potsherd,

unless he was tolerably sure in advance that within the potsherd or

under it there lay more than its value. It was not easy to surmise

the form of the treasure nor the spot where it was hidden, but that

it was there—in kind satisfactory to Davenant

himself—Guion had no doubt. It was his part, therefore, to be

astute and wary, not to lose the chance of selling, and yet not to

allow himself to be overreached. If Davenant was playing a deep

game, he must play a deeper. He was sorry his head ached and that

he felt in such poor trim for making the effort. "I must look

sharp," he said to himself; "and yet I must be square and

courteous. That's the line for me to take." He tried to get some

inspiration for the spurt in telling himself that in spite of

everything he was still a man of business. When at last he began to

speak, it was with something of the feeling of the broken-down

prize-fighter dragging himself bleeding and breathless into the

ring for the last round with a young and still unspent

opponent.
"I didn't suppose you were in—in a position—to do

that."
"I am." Davenant nodded with some emphasis.
"Did you think that that was what I meant when I—I opened

my heart to you last night?"
"No. I know it wasn't. My offer is inspired by nothing but what

I feel."
"Good!" It was some minutes before Guion spoke again. "If I

remember rightly," he observed then, "I said I would sell my soul

for half a million dollars. I didn't say I wanted to borrow that

amount."
"You may put it in any way you like," Davenant smiled. "I've

come with the offer of the money. I want you to have it. The terms

on which you'd take it don't matter to me."
"But they do to me. Don't you see? I'd borrow the money if I

could. I couldn't accept it in any other way. And I can't borrow

it. I couldn't pay the interest on it if I did. But I've exhausted

my credit. I can't borrow any more."
"You can borrow what I'm willing to lend, can't you?"
"No; because Tory Hill is mortgaged for all it will stand. I've

nothing else to offer as collateral—"
"I'm not asking for collateral. I'm ready to hand you over the

money on any terms you like or on no terms at all."
"Do you mean that you'd be willing to—to—to

give it to me?"
"I mean, sir," he explained, reddening a little, "that I want

you to have the money to use—now. We could talk

about the conditions afterward and call them what you please. If I

understood you correctly last night, you're in a tight

place—a confoundedly tight place—"
"I am; but—don't be offended!—it seems to me you'd

put me in a tighter."
"How's that?"
"I'VE DONE WRONG, BUT I'M WILLING TO PAY THE PENALTY"

"I'VE DONE WRONG, BUT I'M WILLING TO PAY THE

PENALTY"

"It's a little difficult to explain." He leaned forward, with

one of his nervous, jerky movements, and fingered the glass

containing the three chrysanthemums, but without taking his eyes

from Davenant. So far he was quite satisfied with himself. "You

see, it's this way. I've done wrong—very wrong. We needn't go

into that, because you know it as well as I. But I'm willing to pay

the penalty. That is, I'm ready to pay the penalty. I've

made up my mind to it. I've had to—of course. But if I

accepted your offer, you'd be paying it, not I."
"Well, why shouldn't I? I've paid other people's debts before

now—once or twice—when I didn't want to. Why shouldn't

I pay yours, when I should like the job?"
Davenant attempted, by taking something like a jovial tone, to

carry the thing off lightly.
"There's no reason why you shouldn't do it; there's only a

reason why I shouldn't let you."
"I don't see why you shouldn't let me. It mayn't be just what

you'd like, but it's surely better than—than what you

wouldn't like at all."
Taking in the significance of these words, Guion colored, not

with the healthy young flush that came so readily to Davenant's

face, but in dabbled, hectic spots. His hand trembled, too, so that

some of the water from the vase he was holding spilled over on the

desk. It was probably this small accident, making him forget the

importance of his rôle, that caused him to jump up nervously

and begin pacing about the room.
Davenant noticed then what he had not yet had time for—the

change that had taken place in Guion in less than twenty hours. It

could not be defined as looking older or haggard or ill. It could

hardly be said to be a difference in complexion or feature or

anything outward. As far as Davenant was able to judge, it was

probably due, not to the loss of self-respect, but to the loss of

the pretense at self-respect; it was due to that desolation of the

personality that comes when the soul has no more reason to keep up

its defenses against the world outside it, when the Beautiful Gate

is battered down and the Veil of the Temple rent, while the Holy of

Holies lies open for any eye to rifle. It was probably because this

was so that Guion, on coming back to his seat, began at once to be

more explanatory than there was any need for.
"I haven't tried to thank you for your kind suggestion, but

we'll come to that when I see more clearly just what you want."
"I've told you that. I'm not asking for anything else."
"So far you haven't asked for anything at all; but I don't

imagine you'll be content with that. In any case," he hurried on,

as Davenant seemed about to speak, "I don't want you to be under

any misapprehension about the affair. There's nothing extenuating

in it whatever—that is, nothing but the intention to 'put it

back' that goes with practically every instance of"—he

hesitated long—"every instance of embezzlement," he finished,

bravely. "It began this way—"
"I don't want to know how it began," Davenant said, hastily.

"I'm satisfied with knowing the situation as it is."
"But I want to tell you. In proportion as I'm open with you I

shall expect you to be frank with me."
"I don't promise to be frank with you."
"Anyhow, I mean to set you the example."
He went on to speak rapidly, feverishly, with that

half-hysterical impulse toward confession from the signs of which

Davenant had shrunk on the previous evening. As Guion himself had

forewarned, there was nothing new or unusual in the tale. The

situations were entirely the conventional ones in the drama of this

kind of unfaithfulness. The only element to make it appealing, an

element forcibly present to Davenant's protective instincts, was

the contrast between what Guion had been and what he was

to-day.
"And so," Guion concluded, "I don't see how I could accept this

money from you. Any honorable man—that is," he corrected, in

some confusion, "any sane man—would tell you as

much."
"I've already considered what the sane man and the honorable man

would tell me. I guess I can let them stick to their opinion so

long as I have my own."
"And what is your opinion? Do you mind telling me? You

understand that what you're proposing is immoral, don't you?"
"Yes—in a way."
Guion frowned. He had hoped for some pretense at

contradiction.
"I didn't know whether you'd thought of that."
"Oh yes, I've thought of it. That is, I see what you mean."
"It's compounding a felony and outwitting the ends of justice

and—"
"I guess I'll do it just the same. It doesn't seem to be my

special job to look after the ends of justice; and as for

compounding a felony—well, it'll be something new."
Guion made a show of looking at him sharply. The effort, or the

pretended effort, to see through Davenant's game disguised for the

moment his sense of humiliation at this prompt acceptance of his

own statement of the case.
"All the same," he observed, trying to take a detached, judicial

tone, "your offer is so amazing that I presume you wouldn't make it

unless you had some unusual reason."
"I don't know that I have. In fact, I know I haven't."
"Well, whatever its nature, I should like to know what it

is."
"Is that necessary?"
"Doesn't it strike you that it would be—in order? If I

were to let you do this for me you'd be rendering me an

extraordinary service. We're both men of business, men of the

world; and we know that something for nothing is not according to

Hoyle."
Davenant looked at him pensively. "That is, you want to know

what I should be pulling off for myself?"
"That's about it."
"I don't see why that should worry you. If you get the

money—"
"If I get the money I put myself in your power."
"What of that? Isn't it just as well to be in my power as in the

power of other people?"
Again Guion winced inwardly, but kept his self-control. He was

not yet accustomed to doing without the formulas of respect from

those whom he considered his inferiors.
"Possibly," he said, not caring to conceal a certain irritation;

"but even so I should like to know in case I were in your

power what you'd expect of me."
"I can answer that question right away. I shouldn't expect

anything at all."
"Then you leave me more in the dark than ever."
Davenant still eyed him pensively. "Do I understand you to be

suspicious of my motives?"
"Suspicious might not be the right word. Suppose we said

curious."
Davenant reflected. Perhaps it was his mastery of the situation

that gave him unconsciously a rock-like air of nonchalance. When he

spoke it was with a little smile, which Guion took to be one of

condescension. Condescension in the circumstances was synonymous

with insolence.
"Well, sir, suppose I allowed you to remain curious? What

then?"
They were the wrong words. It was the wrong manner. Guion looked

up with a start. His next words were uttered in the blind instinct

of the haughty-headed gentleman who thinks highly of himself to

save the moment's dignity.
"In that case I think we must call the bargain off."
Davenant shot out of his seat. He, too, was not without a

current of hot blood.
"All right, sir. It's for you to decide. Only, I'm sorry.

Good-by!" He held out his hand, which Guion, who was now leaning

forward, toying with the pens and pencils on the desk, affected not

to see. A certain lack of ease that often came over Davenant at

moments of leave-taking or greeting kept him on the spot. "I

hoped," he stammered, "that I might have been of some use to you,

and that Miss Guion—"
Guion looked up sharply. "Has she got anything to do

with it?"
"Nothing," Davenant said, quickly, "nothing whatever."
"I didn't see how she could have—" Guion was

going on, when Davenant interrupted.
"She has nothing to do with it whatever," he repeated. "I was

only going to say that I hoped she might have got through her

wedding without hearing anything about—all this—all

this fuss."
In uttering the last words he had moved toward the door. His

hand was on the knob and he was about to make some repetition of

his farewells when Guion spoke again. He was leaning once more over

the desk, his fingers playing nervously with the pens and pencils.

He made no further effort to keep up his rôle of keen-sighted

man of business. His head was bent, so that Davenant could scarcely

see his face, and when he spoke his words were muffled and

sullen.
"Half a million would be too much. Four hundred and fifty

thousand would cover everything."
"That would be all the same to me," Davenant said, in a

matter-of-fact tone.
But he went back to the desk and took his seat again.

VI
H
aving watched through the window her father

pass down the avenue on his way to town, Miss Guion reseated

herself mechanically in her place at the breakfast-table in order

to think. Not that her thought could be active or coherent as yet;

but a certain absorption of the facts was possible by the simple

process of sitting still and letting them sink in. As the minutes

went by, it became with her a matter of sensation rather than of

mental effort—of odd, dream-like sensation, in which all the

protecting walls and clearly defined boundary-lines of life and

conduct appeared to be melting away, leaving an immeasurable

outlook on vacancy. To pass abruptly from the command of means,

dignity, and consideration out into a state in which she could

claim nothing at all was not unlike what she had often supposed it

might be to go from the pomp and circumstance of earth as a

disembodied spirit into space. The analogy was rendered the more

exact by her sense, stunned and yet conscious, of the survival of

her own personality amid what seemed a universal wreckage. This

persistence of the ego in conditions so vast and vague and empty as

to be almost no conditions at all was the one point on which she

could concentrate her faculties.
It was, too, the one point on which she could form an

articulated thought. She was Olivia Guion still! In this slipping

of the world from beneath her feet she got a certain assurance from

the affirmation of her identity. She was still that character,

compounded of many elements, which recognized as its most active

energies insistence of will and tenacity of pride. She could still

call these resources to her aid to render her indestructible.

Sitting slightly crouched, her hands clasped between her knees, her

face drawn and momentarily older, her lips set, her eyes tracing

absently the arabesques chased on the coffee-urn, she was inwardly

urging her spirit to the buoyancy that cannot sink, to the vitality

that rides on chaos. She was not actively or consciously doing

this; in the strictest sense she was not doing it at all; it was

doing itself, obscurely and spontaneously, by the operation of

subliminal forces of which she knew almost nothing, and to which

her personality bore no more than the relation of a mountain range

to unrecordable volcanic fusions deep down in the earth.
When, after long withdrawal within herself, she changed her

position, sighed, and glanced about her, she had a curious feeling

of having traveled far, of looking back on the old familiar things

from a long way off. The richly wrought silver, the cheerful

Minton, the splendidly toned mahogany, the Goya etchings on the

walls, things of no great value, but long ago acquired, treasured,

loved, had suddenly become useless and irrelevant. She had not lost

Tory Hill so much as passed beyond it—out into a condition

where nothing that preceded it could count, and in which, so far as

she was concerned, existence would have to be a new creation,

called afresh out of that which was without form and void.
She experienced the same sensation, if it was a

sensation, when, a half-hour later, she found herself roaming

dreamily rather than restlessly about the house. She was not

anticipating her farewell of it; it had only ceased to be a

background, to have a meaning; it was like the scenery, painted and

set, after the play is done. She herself had been removed

elsewhere, projected into a sphere where the signs and seasons were

so different from anything she had ever known as to afford no

indications—where day did not necessarily induce light, nor

night darkness, nor past experience knowledge. In the confounding

of the perceptive powers and the reeling of the judgment which the

new circumstances produced, she clung to her capacity to survive

and dominate like a staggered man to a stanchion.
In the mean time she was not positively suffering from either

shock or sorrow. From her personal point of view the loss of money

was not of itself an overpowering calamity. It might entail the

disruption of lifelong habits, but she was young enough not to be

afraid of that. In spite of a way of living that might be said to

have given her the best of everything, she had always known that

her father's income was a small one for his position in the world.

As a family they had been in the habit of associating on both sides

of the Atlantic, with people whose revenues were twice and thrice

and ten times their own. The obligation to keep the pace set by

their equals had been recognized as a domestic hardship ever since

she could remember, though it was a mitigating circumstance that in

one way or another the money had always been found. Guion, Maxwell

& Guion was a well which, while often threatening to run dry,

had never failed to respond to a sufficiently energetic pumping.

She had known the thought, however—fugitive, speculatory, not

dwelt upon as a real possibility—that a day might come when

it would do so no more.
It was a thought that went as quickly as it came, its only

importance being that it never caused her a shudder. If it

sometimes brought matter for reflection, it was in showing her to

herself in a light in which, she was tolerably sure, she never

appeared to anybody else—as the true child of the line of

frugal forebears, of sea-scouring men and cheese-paring women, who,

during nearly two hundred years of thrift, had put penny to penny

to save the Guion competence. Standing in the cheerful "Colonial"

hall which their stinting of themselves had made it possible to

build, and which was still furnished chiefly with the

objects—a settle, a pair of cupboards, a Copley portrait, a

few chairs, some old decorative pottery—they had lived with,

it afforded one more steadying element for her bewilderment to

grasp at, to feel herself their daughter.
There was, indeed, in the very type of her beauty a hint of a

carefully calculated, unwasteful adaptation of means to ends quite

in the spirit of their sparing ways. It was a beauty achieved by

nature apparently with the surest, and yet with the slightest,

expenditure of energy—a beauty of poise, of line, of

delicacy, of reserve—with nothing of the superfluous, and

little even of color, beyond a gleam of chrysoprase in fine, gray

eyes and a coppery, metallic luster in hair that otherwise would

have passed as chestnut brown. It was a beauty that came as much

from repose in inaction as from grace in movement, but of which a

noticeable trait was that it required no more to produce it in the

way of effort than in that of artifice. Through the transparent

whiteness of the skin the blue of each clearly articulated vein and

the rose of each hurrying flush counted for its utmost in the

general economy of values.
It was in keeping with this restraint that in all her ways, her

manners, her dress, her speech, her pride, there should be a

meticulous simplicity. It was not the simplicity of the hedge-row

any more than of the hothouse; it was rather that of some classic

flower, lavender or crown-imperial, growing from an ancient stock

in some dignified, long-tended garden. It was thus a simplicity

closely allied to sturdiness—the inner sturdiness not

inconsistent with an outward semblance of fragility—the

tenacity of strength by which the lavender scents the summer and

the crown-imperial adorns the spring, after the severest snows.
It was doubtless, this vitality, drawn from deep down in her

native soil, that braced her now, to simply holding fast

intuitively and almost blindly till the first force of the shock

should have so spent itself that the normal working of the

faculties might begin again. It was the something of which she had

just spoken to her father—the something that might be pride

but that was not wholly pride, which had never been taxed nor

called on. She could not have defined it in a more positive degree;

but even now, when all was confusion and disintegration, she was

conscious of its being there, an untouched treasure of

resources.
In what it supplied her with, however, there was no answer to

the question that had been silently making itself urgent from the

first word of her father's revelations: What was to happen with

regard to her wedding? It took the practical form of dealing with

the mere outward paraphernalia—the service, the bridesmaids,

the guests, the feast. Would it be reasonable, would it be decent,

to carry out rich and elaborate plans in a ruined house? Further

than that she dared not inquire, though she knew very well there

was still a greater question to be met. When, during the course of

the morning, Drusilla Fane came to see her, Olivia broached it

timidly, though the conversation brought her little in the way of

help.
Knowing all she knew through the gossip of servants, Drusilla

felt the necessity of being on her guard. She accepted Olivia's

information that her father had met with losses as so much news,

and gave utterance to sentiments of sympathy and encouragement.

Beyond that she could not go. She was obliged to cast her

condolences in the form of bald generalities, since she could make

but a limited use of the name of Rupert Ashley as a source of

comfort. More clearly than any one in their little group she could

see what marriage with Olivia in her new conditions—the

horrible, tragic conditions that would arise if Peter could do

nothing—would mean for him. She weighed her words, therefore,

with an exactness such as she had not displayed since her early

days among the Sussex Rangers, measuring the little more and the

little less as in an apothecary's balances.
"You see," Olivia said, trying to sound her friend's ideas,

"from one point of view I scarcely know him."
"You know him well enough to be in love with him." Drusilla felt

that that committed her to nothing.
"That doesn't imply much—not necessarily, that is. You can

be in love with people and scarcely know them at all. And it often

happens that if you knew them better you wouldn't be in love with

them."
"And you know him well enough to be sure that he'll want to do

everything right."
"Oh yes; I'm quite sure of that. I'm only uncertain

that—everything right—would satisfy me."
Drusilla reflected. "I see what you mean. And, of course, you

want to do—everything right—yourself."
Olivia glanced up obliquely under her lashes.
"I see what you mean, too."
"You mustn't see too much." Drusilla spoke hastily. She waited

in some anxiety to see just what significance Olivia had taken from

her words; but when the latter spoke it was to pass on to another

point.
"You see, he didn't want to marry an American, in the first

place."
"Well, no one forced him into that. That's one thing he did with

his eyes open, at any rate."
"His doing it was a sort of—concession."
Drusilla looked at her with big, indignant eyes.
"Concession to what, for pity's sake?"
"Concession to his own heart, I suppose." Olivia smiled,

faintly. "You see, all other things being equal, he would have

preferred to marry one of his own countrywomen."
"It's six of one and half a dozen of the other. If he'd married

one of his own countrywomen, the other things wouldn't have been

equal. So there you are."
"But the other things aren't equal now. Don't you see? They're

changed."
"You're not changed." Drusilla felt these words to be

dangerous. It was a relief to her that Olivia should contradict

them promptly.
"Oh yes, I am. I'm changed—in value. With papa's troubles

there's a depreciation in everything we are."
Drusilla repeated these words to her father and mother at table

when she went home to luncheon. "If she feels like that now," she

commented, "what will she say when she knows all?—if

she ever has to know it."
"But she hasn't changed," Mrs. Temple argued.
"It doesn't make any difference in her."
Drusilla shook her head. "Yes, it does, mother dear. You don't

know anything about it."
"I know enough about it," Mrs. Temple declared, with some

asperity, "to see that she will be the same Olivia Guion after her

father has gone to prison as she was in the days of her happiness.

If there's any change, it will be to make her a better and nobler

character. She's just the type to be—to be perfected through

suffering."
"Y-y-es," Drusilla admitted, her head inclined to one side.

"That might be quite true in one way; but it wouldn't help Rupert

Ashley to keep his place in the Sussex Rangers."
"Do you mean to say they'd make him give it up?"
"They wouldn't make him, mother dear. He'd only have to."
"Well, I never did! If that's the British army—"
"The British army is a very complicated institution. It fills a

lot of different functions, and it's a lot of different things.

It's one thing from the point of view of the regiment, and another

from that of the War Office. It's one thing on the official side,

and another on the military, and another on the social. You can't

decide anything about it in an abstract, offhand way. Rupert Ashley

might be a capital officer, and every one might say he'd done the

honorable thing in standing by Olivia; and yet he'd find it

impossible to go on as colonel of the Rangers when his

father-in-law was in penal servitude. There it is in a nutshell.

You can't argue about it, because that's the way it is."
Rodney Temple said nothing; but he probably had these words in

his mind when he, too, early in the afternoon, made his way to Tory

Hill. Olivia spoke to him of her father's losses, though her

allusions to Colonel Ashley were necessarily more veiled than they

had been with Mrs. Fane.
"The future may be quite different from what I expected. I can't

tell yet for sure. I must see how things—work out."
"That's a very good way, my dear," the old man commended. "It's

a large part of knowledge to know how to leave well enough alone.

Nine times out of ten life works out better by itself than we can

make it."
"I know I've got to feel my way," she said, meaning to agree

with him.
"I don't see why."
She raised her eyebrows in some surprise. "You don't

see—?"
"No, I don't. Why should you feel your way? You're not

blind."
"I feel my way because I don't see it."
"Oh yes, you do—all you need to see."
"But I don't see any. I assure you it's all confusion."
"Not a bit, my dear. It's as plain as a pikestaff—for the

next step."
"I don't know what you mean by the next step."
"I suppose the next step would be—well, let us say what

you've got to do to-day. That's about as much ground as any one can

cover with a stride. You see that, don't you? You've got to eat

your dinner, and go to bed. That's all you've got to settle for the

moment."
Her lips relaxed in a pale smile. "I'm afraid I must look a

little farther ahead than that."
"What for? What good will it do? You won't see anything

straight. It's no use trying to see daylight two hours before dawn.

People are foolish enough sometimes to make the attempt, but they

only strain their eyesight. For every step you've got to take

there'll be something to show you the line to follow."
"What?" She asked the question chiefly for the sake of humoring

him. She was not susceptible to this kind of comfort, nor did she

feel the need of it.
"W-well," the old man answered, slowly, "it isn't easy to tell

you in any language you'd understand."
"I can understand plain English, if that would do."
"You can make it do, but it doesn't do very well. It's really

one of those things that require what the primitive Christians

called an unknown tongue. Since we haven't got that as a means of

communication—" He broke off, stroking his long beard with a

big handsome hand, but presently began again.
"Some people call it a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of

fire by night. Some people have described it by other figures of

speech. The description isn't of importance—it's the

Thing."
She waited a minute, before saying in a tone that had some awe

in it, as well as some impatience: "Oh, but I've never seen

anything like that. I never expect to."
"That's a pity; because it's there."
"There? Where?"
"Just where one would look for it—if one looked at all.

When it moves," he went on, his hand suiting the action to the

word, on a level with his eyes, "when it moves, you follow it, and

when it rests, you wait. It's possible—I don't know—I

merely throw out the suggestion—no one can really

know but yourself, because no one but yourself can see

it—but it's possible that at this moment—for

you—it's standing still."
"I don't know what I gain either by its moving or its standing

still, so long as I don't see it."
"No, neither do I," he assented, promptly.
"Well, then?" she questioned.
"Shall I tell you a little story?" He smiled at her behind his

stringy, sandy beard, while his kind old eyes blinked

wistfully.
"If you like. I shall be happy to hear it." She was not

enthusiastic. She was too deeply engrossed with pressing, practical

questions to find his mysticism greatly to the point.
He took a turn around the drawing-room before beginning,

stopping to caress the glaze of one of the K'ang-hsi vases on the

mantelpiece, while he arranged his thoughts.
"There was once a little people," he began, turning round to

where she sat in the corner of a sofa, her hands clasped in her

lap—"there was once a little people—a mere handful, who

afterward became a race—who saw the pillar of cloud by day

and the pillar of fire by night, and followed it. That is to say,

some of them certainly saw it, enough of them to lead the others

on. For a generation or two they were little more than a band of

nomads; but at last they came to a land where they fought and

conquered and settled down."
"Yes? I seem to have heard of them. Please go on."
"It was a little land, rather curiously situated between the

Orient and the West, between the desert and the sea. It had great

advantages both for seclusion within itself and communication with

the world outside. If a divine power had wanted to nourish a tender

shoot, till it grew strong enough to ripen seed that would blow

readily into every corner of the globe, it probably couldn't have

done better than to have planted it just there."
She nodded, to show that she followed him.
"But this little land had also the dangers attendant on its

advantages. To the north of it there developed a great power; to

the south of it another. Each turned greedy eyes on the little

buffer state. And the little buffer state began to be very wise and

politic and energetic. It said, 'If we don't begin to take active

measures, the Assyrian, or the Egyptian, whoever gets here first,

will eat us up. But if we buy off the one, he will protect us

against the other.'"
"That seems reasonable."
"Yes; quite reasonable: too reasonable. They forgot that a power

that could lead them by fire and cloud could protect them even

against conscript troops and modern methods of fighting. They

forgot that if so much trouble had been taken to put them where

they were, it was not that—assuming that they behaved

themselves—it was not that they might be easily rooted out.

Instead of having confidence within they looked for an ally from

without, and chose Egypt. Very clever; very diplomatic. There was

only one criticism to be made on the course taken—that it was

all wrong. There was a man on the spot to tell them so—one of

those fellows whom we should call pessimists if we hadn't been

taught to speak of them as prophets. 'You are carrying your

riches,' he cried to them, 'on the shoulders of young asses, and

your treasures on the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not

profit you. For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no

purpose. Your strength is—to sit still!'" As he

stood looking down at her his kindly eyes blinked for a minute

longer, before he added, "Do you see the point?"
She smiled and nodded. "Yes. It isn't very obscure. Otherwise

expressed it might be, When in doubt, do nothing."
"Exactly; do nothing—till the pillar of cloud begins to

move."
Out of the old man's parable she extracted just one hint that

she considered useful. In the letter which she proceeded to write

Rupert Ashley as soon as she was alone, a letter that would meet

him on his arrival in New York, she gave a statement of such facts

as had come to her knowledge, but abstained from comments of her

own, and from suggestions. She had intended to make both. She had

thought it at first her duty to take the initiative in pointing out

the gulf of difficulties that had suddenly opened up between her

lover and herself. It occurred to her now that she might possibly

discern the leading of the pillar of cloud from self-betrayal on

his part. She would note carefully his acts, his words, the

expressions of his face. She had little doubt of being able to read

in them some indication of her duty. This in itself was a relief.

It was like being able to learn a language instead of having to

invent one. Nevertheless, as she finished her letter she was

impelled to add:
"We have asked some three hundred people to the church for the

28th. Many of them will not be in town, as the season is still so

early; but I think it wisest to withdraw all invitations without

consulting you further. This will leave us free to do as we think

best after you arrive. We can then talk over everything from the

beginning."
With the hint thus conveyed she felt her letter to be discreetly

worded. By the time she had slipped down the driveway to the box at

the gate and posted it with her own hands her father had

returned.
She had ordered tea in the little oval sitting-room they used

when quite alone, and told the maid to say she was not receiving if

anybody called. She knew her father would be tired, but she hoped

that if they were undisturbed he would talk to her of his affairs.

There was so much in them that was mysterious to her.

Notwithstanding her partial recovery from the shock of the morning,

she still felt herself transported to a world in which the needs

were new to her, and the chain of cause and effect had a

bewildering inconsequence. For this reason it seemed to her quite

in the order of things—the curiously inverted order now

established, in which one thing was as likely as another—that

her father should stretch himself in a comfortable arm-chair and

say nothing at all till after he had finished his second cup of

tea. Even then he might not have spoken if her own patience had

held out.
"So you didn't go away, after all," she felt it safe to

observe.
"No, I didn't."
"Sha'n't you have to go?"
There was an instant's hesitation.
"Perhaps not. In fact—I may almost definitely

say—not. I should like another cup of tea."
"That makes three, papa. Won't it keep you awake?"
"Nothing will keep me awake to-night."
The tone caused her to look at him more closely as she took the

cup he handed back to her. She noticed that his eyes glittered and

that in either cheek, above the line of the beard, there was a

hectic spot. She adjusted the spirit-lamp, and, lifting the cover

of the kettle, looked inside.
"Has anything happened?" she asked, doing her best to give the

question a casual intonation.
"A great deal has happened." He allowed that statement to sink

in before continuing. "I think"—he paused long—"I think

I'm going to get the money."
She held herself well in hand, though at the words the old

familiar landmarks of her former world seemed to rise again,

rosily, mistily, like the walls of Troy to the sound of Apollo's

lute. She looked into the kettle again to see if the water was yet

boiling, taking longer than necessary to peer into the quiet

depth.
"I'm so glad." She spoke as if he had told her he had shaken

hands with an old friend. "I thought you would."
"Ah, but you never thought of anything like this."
"I knew it would be something pretty good. With your name, there

wasn't the slightest doubt of it."
Had he been a wise man he would have let it go at that. He was

not, however, a wise man. The shallow, brimming reservoir of his

nature was of the kind that spills over at a splash.
"The most extraordinary thing has happened," he went on. "A man

came to my office to-day and offered to lend me—no, not to

lend—practically to give me—enough money to

pull me through."
She held a lump of sugar poised above his cup with the

sugar-tongs. Her astonishment was so great that she kept it there.

The walls of the city which just now had seemed to be rising

magically faded away again, leaving the same unbounded vacancy into

which she had been looking out all day.
"What do you mean by—practically to give you?"
"The man said lend. But my name is good for even more than you

supposed, since he knows, and I know, that I can offer him no

security."
"How can he tell, then, that you'll ever pay it back?"
"He can't tell. That's just it."
"And can you tell?" She let the lump of sugar fall with a circle

of tiny eddies into the cup of tea.
"I can tell—up to a point." His tone indicated some

abatement of enthusiasm.
"Up to what point?"
"Up to the point that I'll pay it back—if I can. That's

all he asks. As a matter of fact, he doesn't seem to care."
She handed him his cup. "Isn't that a very queer way to lend

money?"
"Of course it's queer. That's why I'm telling you. That's what

makes it so remarkable—such a—tribute—to me, I

dare say that sounds fatuous, but—"
"It doesn't sound fatuous so much as—"
"So much as what?"
The distress gathering in her eyes prepared him for her next

words before she uttered them.
"Papa, I shouldn't think you'd take it."
He stared at her dully. Her perspicacity disconcerted him. He

had expected to bolster up the ruins of his honor by her delighted

acquiescence. He had not known till now how much he had been

counting on the justification of her relief. It was a proof,

however, of the degree to which his own initiative had failed him

that he cowered before her judgment, with little or no protest.
"I haven't said I'd take it—positively."
"Naturally. Of course you haven't."
He dabbled the spoon uneasily in his tea, looking downcast. "I

don't quite see that," he objected, trying to rally his pluck, "why

it should be—naturally."
"Oh, don't you? To me it's self-evident. We may have lost money,

but we're still not—recipients of alms."
"This wasn't alms. It was four hundred and fifty thousand

dollars."
She was plainly awe-struck. "That's a great deal; but I supposed

it would be something large. And yet the magnitude of the sum only

makes it the more impossible to accept."
"Y-es; of course—if you look at it in that way." He put

back his cup on the table untasted.
"Surely it's the only way to look at it? Aren't you going to

drink your tea?"
"No, I think not. I've had enough. I've—I've had

enough—of everything."
He sank back wearily into the depths of his arm-chair. The

glitter had passed from his eyes; he looked ill. He had clearly not

enough courage to make a stand for what he wanted. She could see

how cruelly he was disappointed. After all, he might have accepted

the money and told her nothing about it! He had taken her into his

confidence because of that need of expansion that had often led him

to "give away" what a more crafty man would have kept to himself.

She was profiting by his indiscretion to make what was already so

hard for him still harder. Sipping her tea slowly, she turned the

subject over and over in her mind, seeking some ground on which to

agree with him.
She did this the more conscientiously, since she had often

reproached herself with a fixity of principle that might with some

show of reason be called too inflexible. Between right and wrong

other people, especially the people of her "world," were able to

see an infinitude of shadings she had never been able to

distinguish. She half accepted the criticism often made of her in

Paris and London that her Puritan inheritance had given an

inartistic rigidity to her moral prospect. It inclined her to see

the paths of life as ruled and numbered like the checker-board plan

of an American city, instead of twisting and winding, quaintly and

picturesquely, with round-about evasions and astonishing

short-cuts, amusing to explore, whether for the finding or the

losing of the way, as in any of the capitals long trodden by the

feet of men. Between the straight, broad avenues of conduct, well

lighted and well defined, there lay apparently whole regions of

byways, in which those who could not easily do right could wander

vaguely, without precisely doing wrong, following a line that might

be termed permissible. Into this tortuous maze her spirit now tried

to penetrate, as occasionally, to visit some historic monument, she

had plunged into the slums of a medieval town.
It was an exercise that brought her nothing but a feeling of

bewilderment. Having no sense of locality for this kind of

labyrinth, she could only turn round and round confusedly. All she

could do, when from the drooping of her father's lids she feared he

was falling off to sleep, leaving the question unsettled, was to

say, helplessly:
"I suppose you'll be sorry now for having told me."
He lifted his long lashes, that were like a girl's, and looked

at her. The minutes that had passed had altered his expression.

There was again a sparkle of resolve, perhaps of relief, in his

glance. Without changing his position, he spoke drowsily, and yet

reassuringly, like a man with a large and easy grasp of the

situation. She was not sure whether it was a renewal of confidence

on his part or a bit of acting.
"No, dear, no. I wanted to get your point of view. It's always

interesting to me. I see your objections—of course. I may say

that I even shared some of them—till—"
She allowed him a minute in which to resume, but, as he kept

silence, she ventured to ask:
"Does that mean that you don't share them now?"
"I see what there is to be said—all round. It isn't to be

expected, dear, that you, as a woman, not used to

business—"
"Oh, but I didn't understand that this was business.

That's just the point. To borrow money might be business—to

borrow it on security, you know, or whatever else is the usual

way—but not to take it as a present."
He jerked himself up into a forward posture. When he replied to

her, it was with didactic, explanatory irritation.
"When I said that, I was legitimately using language that might

be called exaggerated. Hyperbole is, I believe, the term

grammarians use for it. I didn't expect you, dear, to take me up so

literally. It isn't like you. You generally have more imagination.

As a matter of fact, Davenant's offer was that of a

loan—"
"Oh! So it was—that man?"
"Yes; it was he. He expressly spoke of it as a loan. I

myself interpreted it as a gift simply to emphasize its

extraordinary generosity. I thought you'd appreciate that. Do you

see?"
"Perfectly, papa; and it's the extraordinary generosity that

seems to me just what makes it impossible. Why should Mr. Davenant

be generous to us? What does he expect to gain?"
"I had that out with him. He said he didn't expect to gain

anything."
"And you believed him?"
"Partly; though I suppose he has something up his sleeve. It

wasn't my policy to question him too closely about that. It's not

altogether my first concern. I need the money."
"But you don't need the money—in that way, papa?"
"I need it in any way. If Davenant will let me have

it—especially on such terms—I've no choice but to take

it."
"Oh, don't, papa. I'm sure it isn't right. I—I don't like

him."
"Pff! What's that got to do with it? This is business."
"No, papa. It's not business. It's a great deal more—or a

great deal less—I don't know which."
"You don't know anything about it at all, dear. You may take

that from me. This is a man's affair. You really must

leave it to me to deal with it." Once more he fell back into the

depth of his arm-chair and closed his eyes. "If you don't mind, I

think I should like a little nap. What have you got so especially

against Davenant, anyhow?"
"I've nothing against him—except that I've never liked

him."
"What do you know about him? When did you ever see him?"
"I haven't seen him for years—not since Drusilla

used to bring him to dances, when we were young girls. She didn't

like it particularly, but she had to do it because he was her

father's ward and had gone to live with them. He was

uncouth—aggressive. Wasn't he a foundling, or a street Arab,

or something like that? He certainly seemed so. He wasn't a

bit—civilized. And once he—he said something—he

almost insulted me. You wouldn't take his money now, papa?"
There was no answer. He breathed gently. She spoke more

forcibly.
"Papa, you wouldn't let a stranger pay your debts?"
He continued to breathe gently, his eyes closed, the long black

lashes curling on his cheek.
"Papa, darling," she cried, "I'll help you. I'll take everything

on myself. I'll find a way—somehow. Only, don't do

this."
He stirred, and murmured sleepily.
"You attend to your wedding, dear. That'll be quite enough for

you to look after."
"But I can't have a wedding if Mr. Davenant has to pay for it.

Don't you see? I can't be married at all."
When he made no response to this shot, she understood finally

that he meant to let the subject drop.

VII
I
t was in the nature of a relief to Olivia Guion

when, on the following day, her father was too ill to go to his

office. A cold, caused by the exposure of two nights previous, and

accompanied by a rising temperature, kept him confined to his room,

though not to bed. The occurrence, by maintaining the situation

where it was, rendered it impossible to take any irretrievable step

that day. This was so much gain.
She had slept little; she had passed most of the night in active

and, as it seemed to her, lucid thinking. Among the points clearest

to her was the degree to which she herself was involved in the

present business. In a measure, the transfer of a large sum of

money from Peter Davenant to her father would be an incident more

vital to her than to any one else, since she more than any one else

must inherit its moral effects. While she was at a loss to see what

the man could claim from them in return for his generosity, she was

convinced that his exactions would be not unconnected with herself.

If, on the other hand, he demanded nothing, then the lifelong

obligation in the way of gratitude that must thus be imposed on her

would be the most intolerable thing of all. Better any privation

than the incurring of such a debt—a debt that would cover

everything she was or could become. Its magnitude would fill her

horizon; she must live henceforth in the world it made, her very

personality would turn into a thing of confused origin, sprung, it

was true, from Henry and Carlotta Guion in the first place, but

taking a second lease of life from the man whose beneficence

started her afresh. She would date back to him, as barbarous women

date to their marriage or Mohammedans to the Flight. It was a

relation she could not have endured toward a man even if she loved

him; still less was it sufferable with one whom she had always

regarded with an indefinable disdain, when she had not ignored him.

The very possibility that he might purchase a hold on her inspired

a frantic feeling, like that of the ermine at pollution.
Throughout the morning she was obliged to conceal from her

father this intense opposition—or, at least to refrain from

speaking of it. When she made the attempt he grew so feverish that

the doctor advised the postponement of distressing topics till he

should be better able to discuss them. She could only make him as

comfortable as might be, pondering while she covered him up in the

chaise-longue, putting his books and his cigars within easy reach,

how she could best convert him to her point of view. It was

inconceivable to her that he would persist in the scheme when he

realized how it would affect her.
She had gone down to the small oval sitting-room commanding the

driveway, thinking it probable that Drusilla Fane might come to see

her. Watching for her approach, she threw open the French window

set in the rounded end of the room and leading out to the

Corinthian-columned portico that adorned what had once been the

garden side of the house. There was no garden now, only a stretch

of elm-shaded lawn, with a few dahlias and zinnias making gorgeous

clusters against the already gorgeous autumn-tinted shrubbery. On

the wall of a neighboring brick house, Virginia creeper and

ampelopsis added fuel to the fire of surrounding color, while a

maple in the middle distance blazed with all the hues that might

have flamed in Moses's burning bush. It was one of those days of

the American autumn when the air is shot with gold, when there is

gold in the light, gold on the foliage, gold on the grass, gold on

all surfaces, gold in all shadows, and a gold sheen in the sky

itself. Red gold like a rich lacquer overlay the trunks of the

occasional pines, and pale-yellow gold, beaten and thin, shimmered

along the pendulous garlands of the American elms, where they

caught the sun. It was a windless morning and a silent one; the

sound of a hammer or of a motorist's horn, coming up from the slope

of splendid woodland that was really the town, accentuated rather

than disturbed the immediate stillness.
To Olivia Guion this quiet ecstasy of nature was uplifting. Its

rich, rejoicing quality restored as by a tonic her habitual

confidence in her ability to carry the strongholds of life with a

high and graceful hand. Difficulties that had been paramount,

overpowering, fell all at once into perspective, becoming heights

to be scaled rather than barriers defying passage. For the first

time in the twenty-four hours since the previous morning's

revelations, she thought of her lover as bringing comfort rather

than as creating complications.
Up to this minute he had seemed to withdraw from her, to elude

her. As a matter of fact, though she spoke of him rarely and always

with a purposely prosaic touch, he was so romantic a figure in her

dreams that the approach of the sordid and the ugly had dispelled

his image. It was quite true, as she had said to Drusilla Fane,

that from one point of view she didn't know him very well. She

might have said that she didn't know him at all on any of those

planes where rents and the price of beef are factors. He had come

into her life with much the same sort of appeal as the wandering

knight of the days of chivalry made to the damsel in the family

fortress. Up to his appearing she had thought herself too

sophisticated and too old to be caught by this kind of fancy,

especially as it was not the first time she had been exposed to it.

In the person of Rupert Ashley, however, it presented itself with

the requisite limitations and accompaniments. He was neither so

young nor so rich nor of such high rank as to bring a

disproportionate element into their romance, while at the same time

he had all the endowments of looks, birth, and legendary courage

that the heroine craves in the hero. When he was not actually under

her eyes, her imagination embodied him most easily in the

svelte elegance of the King Arthur beside Maximilian's

tomb at Innspruck.
Their acquaintance had been brief, but illuminating—one of

those friendships that can afford to transcend the knowledge of

mere outward personal facts to leap to the things of the heart and

the spirit. It was one of the commonplaces of their intimate speech

together that they "seemed to have known each other always"; but

now that it was necessary for her to possess some practical measure

of his character, she saw, with a sinking of the heart, that they

had never passed beyond the stage of the poetic and pictorial.
Speculating as to what he would say when he received her letter

telling of her father's misfortunes, she was obliged to confess

that she "had not the remotest idea." Matters of this sort belonged

to a world on which they had deliberately turned their backs. That

is to say, she had turned her back on it deliberately, though by

training knowing its importance, fearing that to him it would seem

mundane, inappropriate, American. This course had been well enough

during the period of a high-bred courtship, almost too fastidiously

disdainful of the commonplace; but now that the Fairy Princess had

become a beggar-maid, while Prince Charming was Prince Charming

still, it was natural that the former should recognize its

insufficiency. She had recognized it fully yesterday; but this

morning, in the optimistic brightness of the golden atmosphere,

romance came suddenly to life again and confidence grew strong.

Drusilla had said that she, Olivia, knew him well enough to be sure

that he would want to do—everything right. They would do

everything right—together. They would save her father whom

she loved so tenderly, from making rash mistakes, and—who

knew?—find a way, perhaps, to rescue him in his troubles and

shelter his old age.
She was so sure of herself to-day, and so nearly sure of Ashley,

that even the shock of seeing Peter Davenant coming up the

driveway, between the clumps of shrubbery, brought her no dismay.

She was quick in reading the situation. It was after eleven

o'clock; he had had time to go to Boston, and, learning that her

father was not at his office, had come to seek him at home.
She made her arrangements promptly. Withdrawing from the window

before he could see her, she bade the maid say that, Mr. Guion

being ill, Miss Guion would be glad to see Mr. Davenant, if he

would have the kindness to come in. To give an air of greater

naturalness to the mise-en-scène, she took a bit of

embroidery from her work-basket, and began to stitch at it, seating

herself near the open window. She was not without a slight,

half-amused sense of lying in ambush, as if some Biblical voice

were saying to her, "Up! for the Lord hath delivered thine enemy

into thine hand."

"My father isn't well," she explained to Davenant, when she had

shaken hands with him and begged him to sit down. "I dare say he

may not be able to go out for two or three days to come."
"So they told me at his office. I was sorry to hear it."
"You've been to his office, then? He told me you were there

yesterday. That's partly the reason why I've ventured to ask you to

come in."
She went on with her stitching, turning the canvas first on one

side and then on the other, sticking the needle in with very

precise care. He fancied she was waiting for him to "give himself

away" by saying something, no matter what. Having, however, a

talent for silence without embarrassment, he made use of it,

knowing that by means of it he could force her to resume.
He was not at ease; he was not without misgiving. It had been

far from his expectation to see her on this errand, or, for the

matter of that, on any errand at all. It had never occurred to him

that Guion could speak to her of a transaction so private, so

secret, as that proposed between them. Since, then, his partner in

the undertaking had been foolish, Davenant felt the necessity on

his side of being doubly discreet. Moreover, he was intuitive

enough to feel her antipathy toward him on purely general grounds.

"I'm not her sort," was the summing-up of her sentiments he made

for himself. He could not wholly see why he excited her dislike

since, beyond a moment of idiotic presumption long ago, he had

never done her any harm.
He fancied that his personal appearance, as much as anything,

was displeasing to her fastidiousness. He was so big, so awkward;

his hands and feet were so clumsy. A little more and he would have

been ungainly; perhaps she considered him ungainly as it was. He

had tried to negative his defects by spending a great deal of money

on his clothes and being as particular as a girl about his nails;

but he felt that with all his efforts he was but a bumpkin compared

with certain other men—Rodney Temple, for example—who

never took any pains at all. Looking at her now, her pure,

exquisite profile bent over her piece of work, while the sun struck

coppery gleams from her masses of brown hair, he felt as he had

often felt in rooms filled with fragile specimens of

art—flower-like cups of ancient glass, dainty groups in

Meissen, mystic lovelinesses wrought in amber, ivory, or

jade—as if his big, gross personality ought to shrink into

itself and he should walk on tiptoe.
"I understand from my father," she said, when she found herself

obliged to break the silence, "that you've offered to help him in

his difficulties. I couldn't let the occasion pass without telling

you how much I appreciate your generosity."
She spoke without looking up; words and tone were gently

courteous, but they affected him like an April zephyr, that ought

to bring the balm of spring, and yet has the chill of ice in

it.
"Haven't you noticed," he said, slowly, choosing his words with

care, "that generosity consists largely in the point of view of the

other party? You may give away an old cloak, for the sake of

getting rid of it; but the person who receives it thinks you

kind."
"I see that," she admitted, going on with her work, "and yet

there are people to whom I shouldn't offer an old cloak, even if I

had one to give away."
He colored promptly. "You mean that if they needed anything

you'd offer them the best you had."
"I wonder if you'd understand that I'm not speaking ungraciously

if I said that—I shouldn't offer them anything at all?"
He put up his hand and stroked his long, fair mustache. It was

the sort of rebuke to which he was sensitive. It seemed to relegate

him to another land, another world, another species of being from

those to which she belonged. It was a second or two before he could

decide what to say. "No, Miss Guion," he answered then; "I don't

understand that point of view."
"I'm sorry. I hoped you would."
"Why?"
She lifted her clear gray eyes on him for the briefest possible

look. "Need I explain?"
The question gave him an advantage he was quick to seize. "Not

at all, Miss Guion. You've a right to your own judgments. I don't

ask to know them."
"But I think you ought. When you enter into what is distinctly

our private family affair, I've a right to give my opinion."
"You don't think I question that?"
"I'm afraid I do. I imagine you're capable of carrying your

point, regardless of what I feel."
"But I've no point to carry. I find Mr. Guion wanting to borrow

a sum of money that I'm prepared to lend. It's a common situation

in business."
"Ah, but this is not business. It's charity."
"Did Mr. Guion tell you so?"
"He did. He told me all about it. My father has no secrets from

me."
"Did he use the word—charity?"
"Almost. He said you offered him a loan, but that it really was

a gift."
His first impulse was to repudiate this point of view, but a

minute's reflection decided him in favor of plain speaking. "Well,"

he said, slowly, "suppose it was a gift. Would there be

any harm in it?"
"There wouldn't be any harm, perhaps; there would only be

an—impossibility." She worked very busily, and spoke in a low

voice, without looking up. "A gift implies two conditions—on

the one side the right to offer, and on the other the freedom to

take."
"But I should say that those conditions existed—between

Mr. Guion and me."
"But not between you and me. Don't you see? That's the point. To

any such transaction as this I have to be, in many ways, the most

important party."
Again he was tempted to reject this interpretation; but, once

more, on second thought, he allowed it to go uncontested. When he

spoke it was to pass to another order of question.
"I wonder how much you know?"
"About my father's affairs? I know everything."
"Everything?"
"Yes; everything. He told me yesterday. I didn't expect him to

come home last night at all; but he came—and told me what you

had proposed."
"You understood, then," Davenant stammered, "that he might have

to—to—go away?"
"Oh, perfectly."
"And aren't you very much appalled?"
The question was wrung from him by sheer astonishment. That she

should sit calmly embroidering a sofa-cushion, with this knowledge

in her heart, with this possibility hanging over her, seemed to him

to pass the limits of the human. He knew there were heroic women;

but he had not supposed that with all their heroism they carried

themselves with such sang-froid. Before replying she took time to

search in her work-basket for another skein of silk.
"Appalled is scarcely the word. Of course, it was a blow to me;

but I hope I know how to take a blow without flinching."
"Oh, but one like this—"
"We're able to bear it. What makes you think we can't? If we

didn't try, we should probably involve ourselves in worse."
"But how could there be worse?"
"That's what I don't know. You see, when my father told me of

your kind offer, he didn't tell me what you wanted."
"Did he say I wanted anything?"
"He said you hadn't asked for anything. That's what leaves us so

much in the dark."
"Isn't it conceivable—" he began, with a slightly puzzled

air.
"Not that it matters," she interrupted, hurriedly. "Of course,

if we had anything with which to compensate you—anything

adequate, that is—I don't say that we shouldn't consider

seriously the suggestion you were good enough to make. But we

haven't. As I understand it, we haven't anything at all. That

settles the question definitely. I hope you see."
"Isn't it conceivable," he persisted, "that a man might like to

do a thing, once in a way, without—"
"Without asking for an equivalent in return? Possibly. But in

this case it would only make it harder for me."
"How so?"
"By putting me under an overwhelming obligation to a total

stranger—an obligation that I couldn't bear, while still less

could I do away with it."
"I don't see," he reasoned, "that you'd be under a greater

obligation to me in that case than you are to others already."
"At present," she corrected, "we're not under an obligation to

any one. My father and I are contending with circumstances; we're

not asking favors of individuals. I know we owe money—a great

deal of money—to a good many people—"
"Who are total strangers, just like me."
"Not total strangers just like you—but total strangers

whom I don't know, and don't know anything about, and who become

impersonal from their very numbers."
"But you know Mrs. Rodman and Mrs. Clay. They're not

impersonal."
All he saw for the instant was that she arrested her needle

half-way through the stitch. She sat perfectly still, her head

bent, her fingers rigid, as she might have sat in trying to catch

some sudden, distant sound. It was only in thinking it over

afterward that he realized what she must have lived through in the

seconds before she spoke.
"Does my father owe money to them?"
The hint of dismay was so faint that it might have eluded any

ear but one rendered sharp by suspicion. Davenant felt the blood

rushing to his temples and a singing in his head. "My God, she

didn't know!" he cried, inwardly. The urgency of retrieving his

mistake kept him calm and cool, prompting him to reply with assumed

indifference.
"I really can't say anything about it. I suppose they would be

among the creditors—as a matter of course."
For the first time she let her clear, grave eyes rest fully on

him. They were quiet eyes, with exquisitely finished lids and

lashes. In his imagination their depth of what seemed like

devotional reverie contributed more than anything else to her air

of separation and remoteness.
"Isn't it very serious—when there's anything wrong with

estates?"
He answered readily, still forcing a tone of careless

matter-of-fact.
"Of course it's serious. Everything is serious in business. Your

father's affairs are just where they can be settled—now. But

if we put it off any longer it might not be so easy. Men often have

to take charge of one another's affairs—and straighten them

out—and advance one another money—and all that—in

business."
She looked away from him again, absently. She appeared not to be

listening. There was something in her manner that advised him of

the uselessness of saying anything more in that vein. After a while

she folded her work, smoothing it carefully across her knee. The

only sign she gave of being unusually moved was in rising from her

chair and going to the open window, where she stood with her back

to him, apparently watching the dartings from point to point of a

sharp-eyed gray squirrel.
Rising as she did, he stood waiting for her to turn and say

something else. Now that the truth was dawning on her, it seemed to

him as well to allow it to grow clear. It would show her the

futility of further opposition. He would have been glad to keep her

ignorant; he regretted the error into which she herself unwittingly

had led him; but, since it had been committed, it would not be

wholly a disaster if it summoned her to yield.
Having come to this conclusion, he had time to make another

observation while she still stood with her back to him. It was to

consider himself fortunate in having ceased to be in love with her.

In view of all the circumstances, it was a great thing to have

passed through that phase and come out of it. He had read somewhere

that a man is never twice in love with the same person. If that

were so, he could fairly believe himself immune, as after a certain

kind of malady. If it were not for this he would have found in her

hostility to his efforts and her repugnance to his person a

temptation—a temptation to which he was specially liable in

regard to living things—to feel that it was his right to curb

the spirit and tame the rebellion of whatever was restive to his

control. There was something in this haughty, high-strung creature,

poising herself in silence to stand upright in the face of fate,

that would have called forth his impulse to dominate her will, to

subdue her lips to his own, if he had really cared. Fortunately, he

didn't care, and so could seek her welfare with detachment.
Turning slowly, she stood grasping the back of the chair from

which she had risen. He always remembered afterward that it was a

chair of which the flowing curves and rich interlacings of design

contrasted with her subtly emphasized simplicity. He had once had

the morbid curiosity to watch, in an English law-court, the face

and attitude of a woman—a surgeon's wife—standing in

the dock to be sentenced to death. It seemed to him now that Olivia

Guion stood like her—with the same resoluteness, not so much

desperate as slightly dazed.
"Wasn't it for something of that kind—something wrong with

estates—that Jack Berrington was sent to prison?"
The question took him unawares. "I—I don't remember."
"I do. I should think you would. The trial was in all the

papers. It was the Gray estate. He was Mrs. Gray's trustee. He

ruined the whole Gray family."
"Possibly." He did his best to speak airily. "In the matter of

estates there are all sorts of hitches that can happen. Some are

worse than others, of course—"
"I've seen his wife, Ada Berrington, once or twice, when I've

been in Paris. She lives there, waiting for him to come out of

Singville. She avoids her old friends when she can—but I've

seen her."
"I think I remember hearing about them," he said, for the sake

of saying something; "but—"
"I should like to go and talk with my father. Would you mind

waiting?"
She made as though she would pass him, but he managed to bar her

way.
"I wouldn't do that if I were you, Miss Guion. If he's not well

it'll only upset him. Why not let everything be just as it is? You

won't regret it a year hence—believe me. In nine things out

of ten you'd know better than I; but this is the tenth thing, in

which I know better than you. Why not trust me—and let me

have a free hand?"
"I'm afraid I must go to my father. If you'll be kind enough to

wait, I'll come back and tell you what he says. Then we shall know.

Will you please let me pass?"
He moved to one side. He thought again of the woman in the

English law-court. It was like this that she walked from the

dock—erect, unflinching, graceful, with eyes fixed straight

before her, as though she saw something in the air.
He watched her cross the hall to the foot of the staircase.

There she paused pensively. In a minute or two she came back to the

sitting-room door.
"If it should be like—like Jack Berrington," she said,

from the threshold, with a kind of concentrated quiet in her

manner, "then—what you suggested—would be more out of

the question than ever."
"I don't see that," he returned, adopting her own tone. "I

should think it would be just the other way."
She shook her head.
"There are a lot of points of view that you haven't seen yet,"

he persisted. "I could put some of them before you if you'd give me

time."
"It would be no use doing that. I should never believe anything

but that we, my father and I, should bear the responsibilities of

our own acts."
"You'll think differently," he began, "when you've looked at the

thing all round; and then—"
But before he could complete his sentence she had gone.

Having seen her go up-stairs, he waited in some uncertainty.

When fifteen or twenty minutes had gone by and she did not return,

he decided to wait no longer. Picking up his hat and stick from the

chair on which he had laid them, he went out by the French window,

making his way to the gate across the lawn.

VIII
F
inding the door of her father's room ajar, Miss

Guion pushed it open and went in.
Wearing a richly quilted dressing-gown, with cuffs and rolled

collar of lavender silk, he lay asleep in the chaise-longue, a

tan-colored rug across his feet. On a table at his left stood a

silver box containing cigars, a silver ash-tray, a silver

match-box, and a small silver lamp burning with a tiny flame. Each

piece was engraved with his initials and a coat-of-arms. On his

right there was an adjustable reading-stand, holding an open copy

of a recent English review. One hand, adorned with an elaborately

emblazoned seal-ring, hung heavily toward the floor; a cigar that

had gone out was still between the fingers. His head, resting on a

cushion of violet brocade, had fallen slightly to one side.
She sat down beside him, to wait till he woke up. It was a large

room, with white doors and wainscoting. Above the woodwork it was

papered in pale yellow. On the walls there were water-colors,

prints, photographs, and painted porcelain plaques. Over the bed,

for decorative rather than devotional purposes, hung an old French

ivory crucifix, while lower down was a silver holy-water stoup of

Venetian make, that was oftenest used for matches. It had been the

late Mrs. Guion's room, and expressed her taste. It contained too

many ornaments, too many knickknacks, too many mirrors, too many

wardrobes, too many easy-chairs, too much embossed silver on the

dressing-table, too much old porcelain, wherever there was a place

for it. Everything was costly, from the lace coverlet on the bed to

the Persian rugs on the floor.
Olivia looked vaguely about the room, as on an apartment she had

never before seen. She found herself speculating as to the amount

these elaborate furnishings would fetch if sold. She recalled the

fact, forgotten till now, that when the Berringtons' belongings,

purchased with reckless extravagance, passed under the hammer, they

had gone for a song. She made the same forecast regarding the

contents of Tory Hill. Much money had been spent on them, but, with

the exception perhaps of some of the old portraits, there was

little of real intrinsic value. She made the reflection coldly,

drearily, as bearing on things that had no connection with

herself.
Her eyes traveled back to her father. With the muscles of the

face relaxed in sleep, he looked old and jaded. The mustache, which

had not been waxed or curled that day, sagged at the corners, the

mouth sagging under it. Above the line of the beard the skin was

mottled and puffy. The lashes rested on his cheeks with the

luxuriance of a girl's, and the splendid eyebrows had all their

fullness; but the lids twitched and quivered like those of a child

that has fallen asleep during a fit of weeping.
It was this twitching that softened her, that compelled her to

judge him from the most merciful point of view. There was something

piteous about him, something that silenced reproaches, that

disarmed severity. She had come up-stairs staggered,

incredulous—incredulous and yet convinced—outraged,

terrified; but now the appeal of that fagged face and those

quivering lids was too strong for her. It wrought in her not so

much sympathy as comprehension, an understanding of him such as she

had never before arrived at. In his capacity of father she had

loved him unrestrainedly, but admired him with reserves. It was

impossible not to love a parent so handsome, so genial, so kind, so

generally admired; it was equally impossible not to criticize,

however gently, a man with such a love of luxury, of unwarranted

princeliness, and of florid display. She was indulgent to his

tastes in the degree to which a new and enlightened generation can

be tolerant of the errors of that preceding it, but she could not

ignore the fact that the value he set on things—in morals,

society, or art—depended on their power to strike the eye.

She had smiled at that, as at something which, after all, was

harmless. She had smiled, too, when he offered to himself—and

to her also, it had to be admitted—the best of whatever could

be had, since, presumably, he could afford it; though, as far as

she was concerned, she would have been happier with simpler

standards and a less ambitious mode of life. In following the path

her parents had marked out for her, and to some extent beaten in

advance, she had acquiesced in their plans rather than developed

wishes of her own. Having grown tired of her annual round of

American and English country-houses, with interludes for Paris,

Biarritz, or Cannes, she had gone on chiefly because, as far as she

could see, there was nothing else to do.
Looking at him now, it came over her for the first time that she

must be a disappointment to him. He had never given her reason to

suspect it, and yet it must be so. First among the aims for which

he had been striving, and to attain to which he had hazarded so

much, there must have been the hope that she should make a

brilliant match. That, and that alone, would have given them as a

family the sure international position he had coveted, and which

plenty of other Americans were successful in securing.
It was only of late years, with the growth of her own

independent social judgment, that she could look back over the past

and see the Guions as in the van of that movement of the New World

back upon the Old of which the force was forever augmenting. As

Drusilla Fane was fond of saying, it was a manifestation of the

nomadic, or perhaps the predatory, spirit characteristic of the

Anglo-Saxon peoples. It was part of that impulse to expand, annex,

appropriate, which had urged the Angles to descend on the shores of

Kent and the Normans to cross from Dives to Hastings. Later, it had

driven their descendants over the Atlantic, as individuals, as

households, or as "churches"; and now, from their rich,

comfortable, commonplace homes in New England, Illinois, or

California, it bade later descendants still lift up their eyes and

see how much there was to be desired in the lands their ancestors

had left behind—fair parks, stately manors, picturesque

châteaux, sonorous titles, and varied, dignified ways of

living.
To a people with the habit of compassing sea and land to get

whatever was good to have the voyage back was nothing, especially

in the days of easy money and steam. The Guions had been among the

first to make it. They had been among the first Americans to

descend on the shores of Europe with the intention—more or

less obscure, more or less acknowledged, as the case might

be—of acquiring and enjoying the treasures of tradition by

association or alliance or any other means that might present

themselves. Richard Guion, grandfather of Henry Guion, found the

way to cut a dash in the Paris of the early Second Empire and to

marry his daughter, Victoria Guion, to the Marquis de Melcourt.

From the simple American point of view of that day and date it was

a dazzling match, long talked of by the naïve press of New

York, Boston, and Philadelphia.
By the more ambitious members of the Guion house it was

considered as the beginning of a glorious epoch; but, looking back

now, Olivia could see how meager the results had been. Since those

days a brilliant American society had sprung up on the English

stem, like a mistletoe on an oak; but, while Henry and Charlotta

Guion would gladly have struck their roots into that sturdy trunk,

they lacked the money essential to parasitic growth. As for

Victoria Guion, French life, especially the old royalist phase of

it, which offers no crevices on its creaseless bark in which a

foreign seed can germinate, absorbed her within its tough old

blossom as a pitcher-plant sucks in a fly. Henceforth the utmost

she could do for her kith and kin was to force open the trap from

time to time, so that Olivia, if she liked, could be swallowed,

too. In that task the old lady was not only industrious but

generous, offering to subscribe handsomely toward the dot,

as well as giving it to be understood that the bride-elect would

figure in the end as her residuary legatee. Owing to this prospect

Olivia had been compelled to decline a comte and a vicomte of

crusading ancestry, procured at some pains by Madame de Melcourt;

but when she also refused the eminently eligible Duc de Berteuil,

whose terms in the way of dowry were reasonable, while he offered

her a splendidly historic name and background, the Marquise not

unnaturally lost her temper and declared that she washed her hands

of her grandniece once for all.
Not till this minute had Olivia ever considered that this

reluctance on her part to be "well established" must have been

something like a grief to her father, for he had never betrayed a

sign of it. On the contrary, he had seemed to approve her

decisions, and had even agreed with her in preferring the mistletoe

to the pitcher-plant. He welcomed her back to Tory Hill, where her

residences were longer, now that she ceased to be much with Madame

de Melcourt, and yet was always ready with money and his consent

when she had invitations from her friends abroad. On her engagement

to Rupert Ashley he expressed complete satisfaction, and said in so

many words that it was a more appropriate match for her than any

French alliance, however distinguished. His tenderness in this

respect came over her now as peculiarly touching, unsealing the

fount of filial pity at a moment when other motives might have made

for indignation and revolt.
He opened his eyes without giving any other sign of waking.
"Hallo! What are you looking at me for?"
The tone was not impatient, but she heard in it an implication

of fear.
"Papa, are your troubles anything like Jack Berrington's?"
He gazed at her without moving a muscle or changing a shade. She

only fancied that in the long look with which he regarded her there

was a receding, sinking, dying light, as though the soul within him

was withdrawing.
"What makes you ask that?"
The intonation was expressionless, and yet, it seemed to her, a

little wary.
"I ask chiefly because—well, because I think they

are."
He looked at her for a minute more, perhaps for longer.
"Well, then—you're right."
Again she had the sensation, familiar to her since yesterday, of

the world reeling to pieces around her while her own personality

survived. When she spoke, her voice sounded as if it came out of

the wildness of a surging wreck.
"Then that's what you meant in saying yesterday that when

everything was settled you still wouldn't be able to pay all you

owed."
"That's what I meant—exactly."
He lay perfectly still, except that he raised his hand and

puffed at his extinct cigar. She looked down at the pattern on the

Persian rug beside his couch—a symmetrical scroll of old

rose, on a black ground sown with multicolored flowerets.
"I suppose it's the Clay heirs and the Rodman heirs you owe the

money to?"
"And the Compton heirs, and old Miss Burnaby, and the two Misses

Brown, and—"
"Haven't they anything left?"
"Oh yes. It isn't all gone, by any means." Then he added, as if

to make a clean breast of the affair and be done with it: "The

personal property—what you may call the cash—is mostly

gone! Those that have owned real estate—like the Rodmans and

Fanny Burnaby—well, they've got that still."
"I see." She continued to sit looking meditatively down at the

rug. "I suppose," she ventured, after long thinking, "that that's

the money we've been living on all these years?"
"Yes; in the main." He felt it useless to quibble or to try to

extenuate the facts.
"How many years would that be?"
"I'm not very sure; on and off, it's about ten since I began

using some of their money to—help out my income.

Latterly—you may as well know it—I haven't had any real

income of my own at all."
"So that their money has been paying for—for all

this."
Her hands made a confused little gesture, indicating the luxury

of his personal appointments and of the room.
He shrugged his shoulders and arched his eyebrows in a kind of

protest, which was nevertheless not denial. "W-well! If you choose

to put it so!"
"And for me, too," she went on, looking at him now with a

bewildered opening of her large gray eyes—"for my visits, my

clothes, my maid—everything!"
"I don't see any need," he said, with a touch of peevishness,

"for going so terribly into detail."
"I don't see how it can be helped. It's so queer—and

startling—to think I've had so much that wasn't mine."
"You mustn't think it was deliberately planned—" he began,

weakly.
"And now the suggestion is," she interrupted, "that Mr. Davenant

should pay for it. That seems to me to make it even worse

than—than before."
"I confess I don't follow you there," he complained. "If he

doesn't—then I go to Singville."
"Wouldn't you rather?"
He raised himself stiffly into a sitting posture. "Would

you?"
She did not hesitate in her reply. "Yes, papa. I would

rather—if I were you."
"But since you're not me—since you are

yourself—would you still rather that I went to

Singville?"
There was a little lift to her chin, a faint color in her face

as she replied: "I'd rather pay—however I did it. I'd rather

pay—in any way—than ask some one else to do it."
He fell back on the cushion of violet brocade. "So would

I—if I had only myself to think of. We're alike in that."
"Do you mean that you'd rather do it if it wasn't for me?"
"I've got to take everything into consideration. It's no use for

me to make bad worse by refusing a good offer. I must try to make

the best of a bad business for every one's sake. I don't want to

take Davenant's money. It's about as pleasant for me as swallowing

a knife. But I'd swallow a knife if we could only hush the thing up

long enough for you to be married—and for me to settle some

other things. I shouldn't care what happened after that. They might

take me and chuck me into any hole they pleased."
"But I couldn't be married in that way, papa dear. I couldn't be

married at all to—to one man—when another man had a

claim on me."
"Had a claim on you? How do you mean?"
"He'll have that—if he pays for everything—pays for

everything for years and years back. Don't you see?"
"A claim on you for what, pray?"
"That's what I don't know. But whatever it is, I shall feel that

I'm in his debt."
"Nonsense, dear. I call that morbid. It is morbid."
"But don't you think it's what he's working for? I can't see

anything else that—that could tempt him; and the minute we

make a bargain with him we agree to his terms."
There was a long silence before he said, wearily:
"If we call the deal off we must do it with our eyes open to the

consequences. Ashley would almost certainly throw you

over—"
"No; because that possibility couldn't arise."
"And you'll have to be prepared for the disgrace—"
"I shall not look on it as disgrace so much as—paying. It

will be paying for what we've had—if not in one sort of coin,

then in another. But whatever it is, we shall be paying the debt

ourselves; we sha'n't be foisting it off on some one else."
"Why do you say we?"
"Well, won't it be we? I shall have my part in it, sha'n't I?

You wouldn't shut me out from that? I've had my share of

the—of the wrong, so I ought to take my share in the

reparation. My whole point is that we should be acting

together."
"They can't put you in Singville."
"No; but they can't keep me from sitting outside the walls. I

shall want to do that, papa, if you're within. I'm not going to

separate myself from you—or from anything you're responsible

for. I couldn't if I wanted to; but as it happens I shouldn't try.

I should get a kind of satisfaction out of it, shouldn't

you?—the satisfaction of knowing that every day we suffered,

and every night we slept through or wept through, and every bit of

humiliation and dishonor, was so much contributed to the great work

of—paying up. Isn't that the way you'd take it?"
"That's all very fine now, dear, when you're—what shall I

say?—a little bit exaltée; but how do you

think you'll feel when they've—when they've"—he

continued to speak with his eyes shut convulsively—"when

they've arrested me and tried me and sentenced me and locked me up

for ten or fifteen years?"
"I shall feel as if the bitterness of death were past. But I

should feel worse than that—I should feel as if the

bitterness of both death and hell were still to come if we didn't

make an effort to shoulder our own responsibilities."
There was more in the same vein. He listened for the greater

part of the time with his eyes closed. He was too unutterably tired

to argue or to contest her point of view. Beyond suggesting that

there were sides to the question she hadn't yet considered, he felt

helpless. He was restrained, too, from setting them forth by a

certain hesitation in demanding from her anything she did not

concede of her own accord. That she would ultimately see for

herself he had little doubt. In any case he was more or less

indifferent from sheer spiritual exhaustion. He had ceased to

direct, or try to direct, his own affairs or those of any one else.

In his present condition he could only lie still and let come what

might. Fate or God would arrange things either in the way of

adjustment or of fatal ruin without interference on his part.
So as he lay and listened to his daughter he uttered some bit of

reason or some feeble protest only now and then. When,

occasionally, he looked at her, it was to see her—somewhat

deliriously—white, slim, ethereal, inexorable, like the law

of right. He was feverish; his head throbbed; whenever he opened

his eyes the objects in the room seemed to whirl about, while she

sat tense, low-voiced, gentle, a spirit of expiation.
Among the various ways in which he had thought she might take

his dread announcement this one had never occurred to him; and yet,

now that he saw it, he recognized it as just what he might have

expected from the almost too rigid rectitude and decidedly too

uncompromising pride that made up her character. It was the way,

too, he admitted, most worthy of a Guion. It was the way he would

have chosen for himself if he had nothing to consider but his own

tastes. He himself was as eager in his way to make satisfaction as

she; he was only deterred by considerations of common sense. From

the point of view of a man of business it was more than a little

mad to refuse the money that would pay his creditors, hush up a

scandal, and keep the course of daily life running in something

like its accustomed channel, merely because for the rest of his

days he must be placed in a humiliating moral situation. He

wouldn't like that, of course; and yet everything else was so much

worse for his clients, even more than for himself. This was

something she did not see. In spite of the measure in which he had

agreed with her heroic views of "paying," he returned to that

thought after she had kissed him and gone away.
During the conversation with him Olivia had so completely

forgotten Davenant that when she descended to the oval sitting-room

she was scarcely surprised to find that he had left and that

Drusilla Fane was waiting in his place.
"You see, Olivia," Mrs. Fane reasoned, in her sympathetic,

practical way, "that if you're not going to have your wedding on

the 28th, you've got to do something about it now."
"What would you do?"
Olivia brought her mind back with some effort from the

consideration of the greater issues to fix it on the smaller ones.

In its way Drusilla's interference was a welcome diversion, since

the point she raised was important enough to distract Olivia's

attention from decisions too poignant to dwell on long.
"I've thought that over," Drusilla explained—"mother and I

together. If we were you we'd simply scribble a few lines on your

card and send it round by post."
"Yes? And what would you scribble?"
"We'd say—you see, it wouldn't commit you to anything too

pointed—we'd say, simply, 'Miss Guion's marriage to Colonel

Ashley will not take place on October 28th.' There you'd have

nothing but the statement, and they could make of it what they

liked."
"Which would be a good deal, wouldn't it?"
"Human nature being human nature, Olivia, you can hardly expect

people not to talk. But you're in for that, you know, whatever

happens now."
"Oh, of course."
"So that the thing to do is to keep them from going to the

church next Thursday fortnight, and from pestering you with

presents in the mean while. When you've headed them off on that

you'll feel more free to—to give your mind to other

things."
The suggestion was so sensible that Olivia fell in with it at

once. She accepted, too, Drusilla's friendly offer to help in the

writing of the cards, of which it would be necessary to send out

some two hundred. There being no time to lose, they set themselves

immediately to the task, Drusilla at the desk, and Olivia writing

on a blotting-pad at a table. They worked for twenty minutes or

half an hour in silence.
"Miss Guion's marriage to Colonel Ashley will not take place on

October 28th."
"Miss Guion's marriage to Colonel Ashley will not take place on

October 28th."
"Miss Guion's marriage to Colonel Ashley will not take place on

October 28th."
The words, which to Olivia had at first sounded something like a

knell, presently became, from the monotony of repetition, nothing

but a sing-song. She went on writing them mechanically, but her

thoughts began to busy themselves otherwise.
"Drusilla, do you remember Jack Berrington?"
The question slipped out before she saw its significance. She

might not have perceived it so quickly even then had it not been

for the second of hesitation before Drusilla answered and the

quaver in her voice when she did.
"Y-es."
The amount of information contained in the embarrassment with

which this monosyllable was uttered caused Olivia to feel faint. It

implied that Drusilla had been better posted than herself; and if

Drusilla, why not others?
"Do you know what makes me think of him?"
Again there was a second of hesitation. Without relaxing the

speed with which she went on scribbling the same oft-repeated

sentence, Olivia knew that her companion stayed her pen and half

turned round.
"I can guess."
Olivia kept on writing. "How long have you known?"
Drusilla threw back the answer while blotting with unnecessary

force the card she had just written: "A couple of days."
"Has it got about—generally?"
"Generally might be too much to say. Some people have got wind

of it; and, of course, a thing of that kind spreads."
"Of course."
After all, she reflected, perhaps it was just as well that the

story should have come out. It was no more possible to keep it

quiet than to calm an earthquake. She had said just now to her

father that she would regard publicity less as disgrace than as

part of the process of paying up. Very well! If they were a mark

for idle tongues, then so much the better, since in that way they

were already contributing some few pence toward quenching the

debt.
"I should feel worse about it," Drusilla explained, after a

silence of some minutes, "if I didn't think that Peter Davenant was

trying to do something to—to help Cousin Henry out."
Olivia wrote energetically. "What's he doing?"
"Oh, the kind of thing men do. They seem to have wonderful ways

of raising money."
"How do you know he's trying it?"
"I don't know for certain; I've only an idea. I rather gather it

by the queer way he comes and goes. The minute a thing is in

Peter's hands—"
"Have you such a lot of confidence in him?"
"For this sort of thing—yes. He's terribly able, so they

say, financially. For the matter of that, you can see it by the way

he's made all that money. Bought mines, or something, and sold them

again. Bought 'em for nothing, and sold 'em for thousands and

thousands."
"Did I ever tell you that he once asked me to marry him?"
Drusilla wheeled round in her chair and stared, open-mouthed, at

her friend's back.
"No!"
"Oh, it was years ago. I dare say he's forgotten it."
"I'll bet you ten to one he hasn't."
Olivia took another card and wrote rapidly. "Do you suppose,"

she said, trying to speak casually, "that his wanting to help papa

out has anything to do with that?"
"I shouldn't wonder. I shouldn't wonder at all."
"What could it have?"
"Oh, don't ask me! How should I know? Men are so queer. He's

getting some sort of satisfaction out of it, you may depend."
Drusilla answered as she would have liked to be answered were

she in a similar position. That an old admirer should come to her

aid like a god from the machine would have struck her as the most

touching thing in the world. As she wheeled round again to her task

it was not without a pang of wholly impersonal envy at so beautiful

a tribute. She had written two or three cards before she let fall

the remark:
"And now poor, dear old mother is manœuvering to have

me marry him."
The idea was not new to Olivia, so she said, simply, "And are

you going to?"
"Oh, I don't know." Drusilla sighed wearily, then added: "I

sha'n't if I can help it."
"Does that mean that you'll take him if you can't do

better?"
"It means that I don't know what I shall do at all. I'm rather

sick of everything—and so I might do anything. I don't want

to come back to live in America, and yet I feel an alien over

there, now that I haven't Gerald to give me a raison

d'être. They're awfully nice to me—at

Southsea—at Silchester—everywhere—and yet they

really don't want me. I can see that as plainly as I can see your

name on this card. But I can't keep away from them. I've no pride.

At least, I've got the pride, but there's something in me stronger

than pride that makes me a kind of craven. I'm like a dog that

doesn't mind being kicked so long as he can hang about under the

dining-room table to sniff up crumbs. With my temperament it's

perfectly humiliating, but I can't help it. I've got the taste for

that English life as a Frenchman gets a taste for

absinthe—knows that it'll be the ruin of him, and yet goes on

drinking."
"I suppose you're not in love with any one over there?"
There was no curiosity in this question. Olivia asked

it—she could scarcely tell why. She noticed that Drusilla

stopped writing again and once more half turned round, though it

was not till long afterward that she attached significance to the

fact.
"Who on earth should I be in love with? What put that into your

head?"
"Oh, I don't know. Stranger things have happened. You see a

great many men—"
So they went skimming over the surface of confidence, knowing

that beneath what they said there were depths below depths that

they dared not disturb. All the same, it was some relief to both

when the maid came to the door to summon them to luncheon.

IX
D
uring the next day and the next Guion continued

ill, so ill that his daughter had all she could attend to in the

small tasks of nursing. The lull in events, however, gave her the

more time for thinking, and in her thoughts two things struck her

as specially strange. Of these, the first and more remarkable was

the degree to which she identified herself with her father's

wrong-doing. The knowledge that she had for so many years been

profiting by his misdeeds produced in her a curious sense of having

shared them. Though she took pains to remind herself that she was

morally guiltless, there was something within her—an

imaginative quality perhaps that rejected the acquittal. Pity, too,

counted in her mental condition, as did also that yearning instinct

called maternal, which keeps women faithful to the weak and the

fallen among those they love. To have washed her own hands and

said, "See here! I am innocent!" would have seemed to her much like

desertion of a broken old man who had no one but her to stand by

him. Even while she made attempts to reason herself out of it, the

promptings to the vicarious acceptance of guilt, more or less

native to the exceptionally strong and loyal, was so potent in her

that she found herself saying, in substance if not in words,

"Inasmuch as he did it, I did it, too." It was not a purposely

adopted stand on her part; it was not even clear to her why she was

impelled to take it; she took it only because, obeying the dictates

of her nature; she could do nothing else.
Nevertheless, it occasioned her some surprise, whenever she had

time to think of it, to note the speed with which she had adapted

herself to the facts. Once revealed, she seemed to have always

known them—to have shared that first embarrassment for ready

money that had induced her father to borrow from funds so

temptingly under his control, and to have gone on with him, step by

step, through the subsequent years of struggle and disaster. They

were years over which the sun was already darkened and the moon

turned into blood, so that, looking back on them, it was almost

impossible to recapture the memory of the light-heartedness with

which she had lived through them. It was incredible to her now that

they had been years of traveling and visiting and dancing and

hunting and motoring and yachting, of following fashion and seeking

pleasure in whatever might have been the vogue of the minute. Some

other self, some pale, secondary, astral self, must have crossed

and recrossed the Atlantic and been a guest in great houses and

become a favorite in London, Paris, Biarritz, Florida, Scotland,

Rome! Some other self must have been sought out for her society,

admired for her style, and privileged to refuse eligible suitors!

Some other self must have met Rupert Ashley in the little house at

Southsea and promised to become his wife! From the standpoint of

the present it seemed to her as if an unreal life had ended in an

unreal romance that was bringing to her, within a day or two, an

unreal hero. She was forced again face to face with that fact that

the man who was coming to marry her was, for all practical

knowledge that she had of him, a stranger. In proportion as

calamity encompassed her he receded, taking his place once more in

that dim world she should never have frequented and in which she

had no longer lot nor part.
She should never have frequented it for the simple reason that

for all she had brought to it or got from it some one else had to

pay. The knowledge induced a sense of shame which no consciousness

of committed crime could have exceeded. She would have been less

humiliated had she plotted and schemed to win flattery and homage

for herself than she was in discovering that people had been

tricked into giving them spontaneously. To drop the mask, to tear

asunder the robe of pretense, to cry the truth from the housetops,

and, like some Scriptural woman taken in adultery, lie down,

groaning and stunned, under the pelting of the stones of those who

had not sinned, became to her, as the hours dragged on, an

atonement more and more imperative.
But the second odd fact she had to contemplate was the

difficulty of getting a new mode of life into operation.

Notwithstanding all her eagerness to pay, the days were still

passing in gentle routine somewhat quietly because of her father's

indisposition, but with the usual household dignity. There was a

clock-work smoothness about life at Tory Hill, due to the most

competent service secured at the greatest expense. Old servants,

and plenty of them, kept the wheels going noiselessly even while

they followed with passionate interest the drama being played in

the other part of the house. To break in on the course of their

duties, to disturb them, or put a stop to them, was to Olivia like

an attempt to counteract the laws that regulate the sunrise. She

knew neither how to set about it nor where to begin. There was

something poignant in the irony of these unobtrusive services from

the minute when her maid woke her in the morning till she helped

her to change her dress for dinner, and yet there was nothing for

it but to go through the customary daily round. When it became

necessary to tell the women that the preparations for the wedding

must be stopped and that the invitations to the two big dinners

that were to be given in honor of Colonel Ashley had been withdrawn

she gathered from small signs—the feigned stolidity of some

of them and the overacted astonishment of others—that they

had probably been even better informed than Drusilla Fane. After

that the food they brought her choked her and the maid's touch on

her person was like fire, while she still found herself obliged to

submit to these long-established attentions.
She was reduced to drawing patience from what Guion told her as

to his illness checking temporarily the course of legal action.

Most of the men with whom it lay to set the law in motion, notably

Dixon, the District-Attorney, were old friends of his, who would

hesitate to drag him from a sick-room to face indictment. He had

had long interviews with Dixon about the case already, and knew how

reluctant that official was to move in the matter, anyhow; but as

soon as he, Guion, was out and about again, all kindly scruples

would have to yield. "You'll find," he explained to her, "that the

question as to breaking-camp will settle itself then. And besides,"

he added, "it'll be better to wait till Ashley comes and you know

what he's likely to do for you."
With the last consideration she could not but agree, though she

shrank from his way of putting it. It was some satisfaction at

least to know that, since the two hundred cards she had sent out

had reached their recipients, the process of public penance must in

some measure have been started. She had seen no one who could tell

her what the effect had been; her bridesmaids evidently knew enough

to consider silence the better part of sympathy; not even Drusilla

Fane had looked in or called her on the telephone during the last

day or two; but she could imagine pretty well the course that

comment and speculation must be taking through the town. There

would be plenty of blame, some jubilation, and, she felt sure, not

a little sympathy withal. There was among her acquaintance a local

American pride that had always been jealous of her European

preferences and which would take the opportunity to get in its bit

of revenge, but in general opinion would be kindly. There came an

afternoon when she felt the desire to go forth to face it, to take

her first impressions of the world in her new relationship toward

it. She had not been beyond their own gate since the altered

conditions had begun to obtain. She had need of the fresh air; she

had need to find her bearings; she had need of a few minutes'

intercourse with some one besides her father, so as not to imperil

her judgment by dwelling too incessantly on an idée

fixe. Rupert Ashley would land that night or the next morning.

In forty-eight hours he would probably be in Boston. It was

prudent, she reflected, to be as well poised and as sure of herself

as possible before his arrival on the scene.
Her father was slightly better. He could leave his bed, and,

wrapped in his violet dressing-gown, could lie on the

chaise-longue, surrounded by the luxurious comforts that were a

matter of course to him. As she made him snug he observed with a

grim smile that his recovery was a pity. He could almost hear, so

he said, Dixon and Johnstone and Hecksher and others of his cronies

making the remark that his death would be a lucky way out of the

scrape.
She had come, dressed for the street, to tell him she was

walking down to the Temples', to see what had become of Drusilla

Fane. She thought it needless to add that she was inventing the

errand in order to go out and take notes on the new aspect the

world must henceforth present to her.
He looked at her with an approval that gradually merged into a

sense of comfort. She had chosen the simplest dress and hat in her

wardrobe, as significant of a chastened soul; but simplicity more

than anything else emphasized her distinction. "She'll be all

right," he said, consolingly, to himself. "Whatever happens she's

the kind to come out on top. Rupert Ashley would be a fool to throw

over a superb, high-spirited creature like that. He'll not do it.

Of that I feel sure."
The conviction helped him to settle more luxuriously into the

depths of his couch and to relish the flavor of his cigar. He was

quite sincere in the feeling that if she were but safe he should be

more or less indifferent to the deluge overwhelming himself.
"Papa," she ventured at last, watching carefully the action of

the little silver button-hook, as she buttoned her gloves, "if that

Mr. Davenant came while I'm gone, you wouldn't change your mind,

would you?"
"I don't think he's in the least likely to turn up."
"But if he did?"
"Well, I suppose you'll be back before long. We couldn't settle

anything without talking it over, in any case."
Forced to be content with that, she kissed him and turned

away.
SHE FOUND COMFORT IN GETTING INTO THE OPEN AIR
SHE FOUND COMFORT IN GETTING INTO THE OPEN

AIR

She found a comfort in getting into the open air, into the

friendly streets, under the shade of the familiar trees, that

surprised her. The absence of pose characteristic of the average

American town struck her for the first time as soothing. With none

of the effort to make life conform to a rigid standard of

propriety, which in an English community would be the first thing

to notice, there was an implied invitation to the spirit to relax.

In the slap-dash, go-as-you-please methods of building, paving, and

cleaning she saw a tacit assumption that, perfection being not of

this world, one is permitted to rub along without it. Rodney Lane,

which in Colonial days had led to Governor Rodney's "Mansion," had

long ago been baptized Algonquin Avenue by civic authorities with a

love of the sonorous, but it still retained the characteristics of

a New England village street. Elms arched over it with the

regularity of a Gothic vaulting, and it straggled at its will. Its

houses, set in open lawns, illustrated all the phases of the

national taste in architecture as manifested throughout the

nineteenth century, from the wooden Greek temple with a pillared

façade of the early decades to the bizarre compositions,

painted generally in dark red and yellow, with many gables and long

sweeps of slanting roof, which marked that era's close. In most

cases additions had been thrown out from time to time, ells

trailing at the back, or excrescences bulging at the sides, that

were not grotesque only because there had been little in the first

effect to spoil. In more than one instance the original fabric was

altered beyond recognition; here and there a house she could

remember had altogether disappeared; a new one had replaced it that

before long might be replaced by a newer still. To Olivia the

consoling thought was precisely in this state of transition, to

which rapid vicissitude, for better or for worse, was something

like a law. It made the downfall of her own family less

exceptional, less bitter, when viewed as part of a huge

impermanency, shifting from phase to phase, with no rule to govern

it but the necessities of its own development.
Until this minute it was the very element in American life she

had found most distasteful. Her inclinations, carefully fostered by

her parents, had always been for the solid, the well-ordered, the

assured, evolved from precedent to precedent till its conventions

were fixed and its doings regulated as by a code of etiquette. Now,

all of a sudden, she perceived that life in shirt-sleeves possessed

certain advantages over a well-bred existence in full dress. It

allowed the strictly human qualities an easier sort of play. Where

there was no pretense at turning to the world a smooth, impeccable

social front, toil and suffering, misfortune and disgrace, became

things to be less ashamed of. Practically every one in these

unpretentious, tree-shaded houses knew what it was to struggle

upward, with many a slip backward in the process and sometimes a

crashing fall from the top. These accidents were understood. The

result was the creation of a living atmosphere, not perhaps highly

civilized, but highly sympathetic, charged with the comprehension

of human frailty, into which one could carry one's dishonor, not

wholly with equanimity, but at least with the knowledge that such

burdens were not objects for astonishment. As she descended the

hill, therefore, she felt, as she had never felt before, the

comforting assurance of being among brethren, before whom she

should not have the wearisome task of "keeping up appearances," and

by whom she would be supported, even at the worst, through a

fellow-feeling with her cares.
This consciousness helped her to be firm when, a few minutes

later, having reached the dike by the border of the Charles, she

came face to face with Peter Davenant. She saw him from a long way

off, but without recognition. She noticed him only as an unusually

tall figure, in a summery gray suit and a gray felt hat. He was

sauntering in a leisurely way toward her, stopping now and then to

admire some beautiful dog sniffing the scent of water-rats in the

weeds, or a group of babies tumbling on the sand, or a half-naked

undergraduate sculling along the serpentine reaches of the river,

or a college crew cleaving the waters with the precision of an

arrow, to a long, rhythmic swing of eight slim bodies and a low,

brief grunt of command. The rich October light striking silvery

gleams from the walls of the Stadium and burnished gold from the

far-off dome of the State House brought all the hues of fire from

the rim of autumnal hills on the western horizon. It touched up

with soft dove-gray, in which were shades of green and purple, the

row of unpainted, ramshackle wooden cabins—hovels of a colony

of "squatters" that no zeal for civic improvement had ever been

able to dislodge—lined along a part of the embankment, and

wrought indefinable glories in the unkempt marshes, stretching away

into shimmering distances, where factory windows blazed as if from

inner conflagration and steam and smoke became roseate or

iridescent.
The tall stranger, so much better dressed than the men who

usually strolled on the embankment at this hour of a week-day

afternoon, fixed her attention to such a degree as to make her

forget that she herself was probably a subject of curiosity and

speculation among the passers-by. It was with a little

disappointment that as she came nearer she said to herself, "It's

only—that man." Common fairness, however, obliged her to add

that he seemed "more like a gentleman" than she had supposed. That

he was good-looking, in a big, blond, Scotch or Scandinavian way,

she had acknowledged from the first. On recognizing Davenant her

impulse was to pass him with the slightest recognition, but on

second thoughts it seemed best to her to end the affair impending

between them once for all.
"I'm sorry you didn't wait for me to come downstairs the other

day," she said, after they had exchanged greetings, "because I

could have told you that my father agreed with me—that it

wouldn't be possible for us to accept your kind help."
"I hope he's better," was Davenant's only answer.
"Much better, thank you. When he's able to see you, I know he

will want to express his gratitude more fully than I can."
"I hoped he'd be able to see me to-day. I was on my way to Tory

Hill."
She was annoyed both by his persistency and by the coolness of

his manner, as, leaning on his stick, he stood looking down at her.

He looked down in a way that obliged her to look up. She had not

realized till now how big and tall he was. She noticed, too, the

squareness of his jaw, the force of his chin, and the compression

of his straight, thin lips beneath the long curve of his mustache.

In spite of his air of granite imperturbability, she saw that his

fair skin was subject to little flushes of embarrassment or

shyness, like a girl's. As she was in a mood to criticize, she

called this absurd and said of his blue eyes, resting on her with a

pensive directness, as though he were studying her from a long way

off, that they were hard. Deep-set and caverned under heavy,

overhanging brows, they more than any other feature imparted to his

face the frowning and farouche effect by which she judged

him. Had it not been for that, her hostility to everything he said

and did might not have been so prompt. That he was working to get

her into his power became more than ever a conviction the minute

she looked into what she called that lowering gaze.
All the same, the moment was one for diplomatic action rather

than for force. She allowed a half-smile to come to her lips, and

her voice to take a tone in which there was frank request, as she

said: "I wish you wouldn't go."
"I shouldn't if it wasn't important. I don't want to annoy you

more than I can help."
"I don't see how anything can be important when—when

there's nothing to be done."
"There's a good deal to be done if we choose to do it; but we

must choose at once. The Benn crowd is getting restive."
"That doesn't make any difference to us. My father has decided

to take the consequences of his acts."
"You say that so serenely that I guess you don't understand yet

just what they'd be."
"I do—I do, perfectly. My father and I have talked it all

over. We know it will be terrible; and yet it would be more

terrible still to let some one else pay our debts. I dare say you

think me monstrous, but—"
"I think you mistaken. I don't want to say more than that. If I

find Mr. Guion of the same opinion—"
"I see. You don't consider my word sufficient."
"Your word is all right, Miss Guion," he tried to laugh. "What

you lack is authority. My dealings are with your father. I can't

settle anything with—a substitute."
She colored swiftly. "I don't presume to settle anything. I only

thought I might give you some necessary information. I hoped, too,

to save you a little trouble in sparing you the walk to Tory

Hill."
He looked away from her, his eyes wandering up the reach of the

river, over which the long, thin, many-oared college craft shot

like insects across a pool.
"Why should you be so bent on seeing your father follow Jack

Berrington, when it could be avoided?"
"Why should you care? What difference does it make to you? If

you'd only explain that—"
"It explains itself. If I saw a woman leap into the river there

I should pull her out. The more she insisted on being drowned, the

more I should try to save her."
"But, you see, I'm not leaping into a river. On the contrary,

I'm getting out of one. It seems to me that you'd be only forcing

me back and making my last state worse than the first."
It took him a minute to grasp the force of this. "That would

depend, of course, on the point of view. As a matter of fact, it's

something with which I've nothing to do. It concerns you, and it

concerns Mr. Guion, but it doesn't concern me. For me the whole

thing is very simple. I've offered to lend Mr. Guion a sum of

money. It's for him to take or to leave. If he refuses it, I

sha'n't be offended; and if he doesn't refuse it—"
"You'd let him have it, just the same?"
"Of course. Why not?"
"In spite of all I've said as to what I should feel?"
"But I'm not supposed to know anything about that, you know. I

repeat that it isn't my affair. If Mr. Guion should accept my loan

against your wishes—well, that's something you'd have to fix

up with him."
She was some minutes silent, her eyes ranging over the river and

the marshes, like his own.
"If you urged it on him," she said at last, "I think he'd take

it."
"Then so much the better, from my point of view."
"Precisely; but then your point of view is a mystery. Not that

it makes any difference," she hastened to add. "If my father

accepts your loan, it will be for me to pay it back, in one way or

another—if I ever can."
"We could talk of that," he smiled, trying to be reassuring,

"after more important things had been settled."
"There wouldn't be anything more important—for me."
"Oh, you wouldn't find me an importunate creditor."
"That wouldn't help matters—so long as I owed the debt.

After all, we belong to that old-fashioned, rather narrow-minded

class of New England people to whom debt of any kind is the source

of something like anguish. At least," she corrected herself, "I

belong to that class."
It was on his lips to remind her that in her case there could be

no present release from indebtedness, there could only be a change

of creditors; but he decided to express himself more

gracefully.
"Wouldn't it be possible," he asked, "to put the boot on the

other foot, and to consider me as the person to whom the favor is

shown in being allowed to do something useful?"
She lifted her chin scornfully. "That would be childish. It

would be a mere quibbling with words."
"But it would be true. It's the way I should take it."
She confronted him with one of her imperious looks. "Why?"
In the monosyllable there was a demand for complete explanation,

but he met it with one of his frank smiles.
"Couldn't you let me keep that as my secret?"
"So that you would be acting in the daylight and we in the

dark."
"You might be in the dark, and still have nothing to be afraid

of."
She shook her head. "I should be afraid. It was in the

dark, according to the old story, that the antelope escaped a lion

by falling into a hunter's trap."
"Do I look like that kind of a hunter?" He smiled again at the

absurdity of her comparison.
"You can't tell anything from looks—with men. With men a

woman has only one principle to guide her—to keep on the safe

side."
"I hope you won't think me uncivil, Miss Guion, if I point out

that, at present, you haven't got a safe side to keep on. That's

what I want to offer you."
"I might ask you why again, only that we should be going round

in a circle. Since you don't mean to tell me, I must go without

knowing; but I'm sure you can understand that to some natures the

lion is less to be feared than the hunter."
"He doesn't feel so." He nodded his head in the

direction of Tory Hill.
"He feels so. He's only a little—wavering."
"And I guess you're a little wavering, too, Miss Guion, if you'd

only own up to it."
He watched her straighten her slight figure while her delicate

features hardened to an expression of severity. "I'm not wavering

on the principle, nor because of anything I should have to face

myself. If I have any hesitation, it's only because of what it

would mean for papa."
He allowed an instant to pass while he looked down at her

gravely. "And he's not the only one, you know," he said, with all

the significance he could put into his tone.
His hint, however, was thrown away, since she was intent on her

own line of thought. With a slight nod of the head, dignified

rather than discourteous, she departed, leaving him, to the great

interest of the passers-by, leaning on his stick and staring after

her.

X
A
s Olivia continued on her way toward Rodney

Temple's she was able to make it clear to herself that a chief

reason for her dislike of Davenant sprang from his immovability.

There was something about him like a giant rock. She got the

impression that one might dash against him forever and hurt no one

but oneself. It was a trait new to her among American men, whom she

generally found too yielding where women were concerned. This man

had an aloofness, too, that was curiously disconcerting. He made no

approaches; he took no liberties. If he showed anything that

resembled a personal sentiment toward her, it was dislike. Making

that reflection and using that word, she was almost startled. A

woman had sometimes disliked her; she knew that; but a

man—never! And yet it was difficult to interpret Davenant's

bearing toward her in any other way. It was a bearing in which

there were no concessions to her whatever, while there was in

it—it was only too plain!—a distinct intention to

ignore her. For the time being this personal element in the

situation loomed larger than any other. It challenged her; it even

annoyed her. At the same time it gave Davenant an importance in her

eyes which she was far from willing to concede.
Rodney Temple's house, which was really within the borders of

Cambridge, built about 1840 by some Harvard professor in easy

circumstances, had originally resembled a square brick box. In the

course of seventy years it had passed through the hands of several

owners, each of whom had built on an additional box according to

his needs. To the north a rectangular wing of one story had been

thrown out as a drawing-room; to the south a similar projection

formed the library and study. A smaller square crowned the edifice

as a cupola, while cubes of varying dimensions were half visible at

the back. Against the warm, red brick a Wren portico in

white-painted wood, together with the white facings of the windows,

produced an effect of vivid spotlessness, tempered by the

variegated foliage of climbing vines. The limitations of the open

lawn were marked by nothing but a line of shrubs.
Having arrived at the door, it was a relief to Olivia, rather

than the contrary, to learn that the ladies were not at home, but

that Mr. Temple himself would be glad to see her if she would come

in. He had, in fact, espied her approach from his study window and

had come out into the hall to insist on her staying. Within a

minute or two she found herself sitting in one of his big, shabby

arm-chairs saying things preliminary to confidence.
It was a large room, with windows on three sides, through which

the light poured in to find itself refracted by a hundred lustrous

surfaces. The first impression received on entering what Rodney

Temple called his work-room was that of color—color unlike

that of pictures, flowers, gems, or sunsets, and yet of

extraordinary richness and variety. Low bookcases, running round

the room, offered on the broad shelf forming the top space for many

specimens of that potter's art on which the old man had made

himself an authority. Jars and vases stood on tables, plaques and

platters hung on the walls, each notable for some excellence in

shape, glaze, or decoration. Of Americans of his generation Rodney

Temple had been among the first to respond to an appeal that came

from ages immeasurably far back in the history of man. His

imagination had been stirred in boyhood by watching a common

country potter turn off bowls and flowerpots that sprang from the

wheel in exquisite, concentric forms or like opening lilies of red

earth. Here, he had said to himself, is the beginning of everything

we call art—here must have been the first intimation to man

that beauty could be an element in the work of his own fingers.
In a handicraft that took the dust of the earth to minister to

man's humblest needs, and yet contrived thereby to enrich his

aesthetic life, young Rodney Temple, as he was then, found much

that was congenial to his own mystical aspirations. During his

early travels abroad the factories of Meissen and Sèvres

interested him more than the Zwinger and the Louvre.
He frequented the booths and quays and dingy streets of the

older European cities, bringing out from some lost hiding-place now

an Arabic tile in which the green of the oasis intensified the blue

of the desert sky; now a Persian bowl of hues that changed with a

turn of the head or a quiver of the lids; now a Spanish plaque

gleaming with metallic, opalescent colors, too indefinable to name,

too fugitive for the eye to transmit to memory. Later he picked up

strange examples which, like meteoric stones from another sphere,

had found their mysterious way from Chinese palaces to his grimy

haunts in London, Amsterdam, or Florence, as the case might

be—a blue-and-white jar of Chia-ching, or a Han ceremonial

vessel in emerald green, incrusted from long burial, or a celadon

bowl that resembled a cup of jade, or some gorgeously decorated bit

of Famille Verte. He knew at first little or nothing of the nature

and history of these precious "finds." He saw only that they were

rare and lovely and that through beauty as a means of grace he

entered into communion with men who had neither epoch nor ideals in

common with himself.
In the end he became an authority on ceramic art by the simple

process of knowing more about it than anybody else. When the

trustees of the Harvard Gallery of Fine Arts awoke to that fact, he

was an assistant professor of Greek in the University. Under his

care, in the new position they offered him, a collection was formed

of great celebrity and value; but nothing in it was ever quite so

dear to him as the modest treasures he had acquired for himself in

the days of his young enthusiasm, when his fellow-countrymen as yet

cared for none of these things. As Olivia sat and talked her eye

traveled absently from barbaric Rouen cornucopias and cockatoos to

the incrusted snails and serpents of Bernard Palissy, resting long

on a flowered jardinière by Veuve Perrin, of Marseilles. She

had little technical knowledge of the objects surrounding her, but

she submitted to the strange and soothing charm they never failed

to work on her—the charm of stillness, of peace, as of things

which, made for common homely uses, had passed beyond that stage

into an existence of serenity and loveliness.
"When you spoke the other day," she said, after the conversation

had turned directly on her father's affairs—"when you spoke

the other day about a pillar of cloud, I suppose you meant what one

might call—an overruling sense of right."
"That might do as one definition."
"Because in that case you may like to know that I think I've

seen it."
"I thought you would if you looked for it."
"I didn't look for it. It was just—there!"
"It's always there; only, as in the case of the two disciples on

the Emmaus road, our eyes are holden so that we don't see it."
"I should have seen it easily enough; but if you hadn't told me,

I shouldn't have known what it was. I didn't suppose that we got

that kind of guidance nowadays."
"The light is always shining in darkness, dearie; only the

darkness comprehendeth it not. That's all there is to it."
He sat at his desk, overlooking the embankment and the curves of

the Charles. It was a wide desk littered with papers, but with

space, too, for some of the favorite small possessions that served

him as paper-weights—a Chinese dragon in blue-green enamel, a

quaintly decorated cow in polychrome Delft, a dancing satyr in

biscuit de Sèvres. On the side remote from where he sat was

a life-size bust of Christ in fifteenth-century Italian

terra-cotta—the face noble, dignified, strongly

sympathetic—once painted, but now worn to its natural tint,

except where gleams of scarlet or azure showed in the folds of the

vesture. While the old man talked, and chiefly while he listened,

the fingers of his large, delicately articulated hand stroked

mechanically the surfaces of a grotesque Chinese figure carved in

apple-green jade. It was some minutes before Olivia made any

response to his last words. "Things are very dark to me,"

she confessed, "and yet this light seems to me absolutely positive.

I've had to make a decision that would be too frightful if

something didn't seem to be leading me into the Street called

Straight, as papa says. Did you know Mr. Davenant had offered to

pay our debts?"
He shook his head.
"Of course I couldn't let him do it."
"Couldn't you?"
"Do you think I could?"
"Not if you think differently. You're the only judge."
"But if I don't, you know, papa will have to go—" She

hesitated. "You know what would happen, don't you?"
"I suppose I do."
"And I could prevent it, you see, if I let papa take this money.

I have to assume the responsibility of its refusal. It puts me in a

position that I'm beginning to feel—well, rather

terrible."
"Does it?"
"You don't seem very much interested, Cousin Rodney. I hoped

you'd give me some advice."
"Oh, I never give advice. Besides, if you've got into the Street

called Straight, I don't see why you need advice from any one."
"I do. The Street called Straight is all very well,

but—"
"Then you're not so sure, after all."
"I'm sure in a way. If it weren't for papa I shouldn't have any

doubt whatever. But it seems so awful for me to drive him into what

I don't think he'd do of his own accord." She went on to explain

Davenant's offer in detail. "So you see," she concluded, "that

papa's state of mind is peculiar. He agrees with me that the higher

thing would be not to take the money; and yet if I gave him the

slightest encouragement he would."
"And you're not going to?"
"How could I, Cousin Rodney? How could I put myself under such

an obligation to a man I hardly know?"
"He could probably afford it."
"Is he so very rich?" There was a hint of curiosity in the

tone.
Rodney Temple shrugged his shoulders. "Oh, rich enough. It would

pretty well clean him out; but, then, that would do him good."
"Do him good—how?"
"He's spoiling for work, that fellow is. Since he's had all that

money he's been of no use to himself or to anybody else. He's like

good capital tied up in a stocking instead of being profitably

invested."
"And yet we could hardly put ourselves in a humiliating

situation just to furnish Mr. Davenant with an incentive for

occupation, could we, Cousin Rodney?"
"I dare say not."
"And he isn't offering us the money merely for the sake of

getting rid of it, do you think?"
"Then what is he offering it to you for?"
"That's exactly what I want to know. Haven't you any idea?"
"Haven't you?"
She waited a minute before deciding to speak openly. "I suppose

you never heard that he once asked me to marry him?"
He betrayed his surprise by the way in which he put down the

little Chinese figure and wheeled round more directly toward

her.
"Who? Peter?"
She nodded.
"What the dickens made him do that?"
She opened her eyes innocently. "I'm sure I can't imagine."
"It isn't a bit like him. You must have led him on."
"I didn't," she declared, indignantly. "I never took any notice

of him at all. Nothing could have astonished me more than

his—his presumption."
"And what did you say to him? Did you box his ears?"
"I was very rude, and that's partly the trouble now. I feel as

if he'd been nursing a grudge against me all these years—and

was paying it."
"In that case he's got you on the hip, hasn't he? It's a lovely

turning of the tables."
"You see that, Cousin Rodney, don't you? I couldn't let

a man like that get the upper hand of me."
"Of course you couldn't, dear. I'd sit on him if I were you, and

sit on him hard. I'd knock him flat—and let Delia Rodman and

Clorinda Clay go to the deuce."
She looked at him wonderingly. "Let—who—go to the

deuce?"
"I said Delia Rodman and Clorinda Clay. I might have included

Fanny Burnaby and the Brown girls. I meant them, of course. I

suppose you've been doing a lot of worrying on their account."
"I—I haven't," she stammered. "I haven't thought of them

at all."
"Then I wouldn't. They've got no legal claim on you whatever.

When they put their money into your father's hands—or when

other people put it there for them—they took their chances.

Life is full of risks like that. You're not responsible for them,

not any more than you are for the fortunes of war. If they've had

bad luck, then that's their own lookout. Oh, I shouldn't have them

on my mind for a minute."
She was too startled to suspect him of ruse or strategy.
"I haven't had them on my mind. It seems queer—and yet I

haven't. Now that you speak of them, of course I see—" She

passed her hand across her brow. There was a long, meditative

silence before she resumed. "I don't know what I've been dreaming

of that it didn't occur to me before. Papa and Mr. Davenant both

said that I hadn't considered all the sides to the question; and I

suppose that's what they were thinking of. It seems so

obvious—now."
She adjusted her veil and picked up her parasol as though about

to take leave; but when she rose it was only to examine, without

seeing it, a plaque hanging on the wall.
"If papa were to take Mr. Davenant's money," she said, after

long silence, without turning round, "then his clients would be as

well off as before, wouldn't they?"
"I presume they would."
"And now, I suppose, they're very poor."
"I don't know much about that. None of them were great

heiresses, as it was. Miss Prince, who keeps the school, told your

cousin Cherry yesterday that the Rodman girls had written her from

Florence, asking if she could give them a job to teach Italian.

They'll have to teach away like blazes now—anything and

everything they know."
She turned round toward him, her eyes misty with distress.
"See this bit of jade?" he continued, getting up from his chair.

"Real jade that is. Cosway, of the Gallery, brought it to me when

he came home from Peking. That's not real jade you've got at Tory

Hill. It's jadeite."
"Is it?" She took the little mandarin in her hand, but without

examining him. "I've no doubt you've been dreadfully worried about

them—papa's clients, I mean."
"W-well—a little—or, rather, not at all. That is, I

should have been worried if it hadn't been for the conviction that

something would look out for them. Something always does, you

know."
The faint smile that seemed to have got frozen on her lips

quivered piteously. "I wish you could have that comfortable feeling

about me."
"Oh, I have. That'll be all right. You'll be taken care of from

start to finish. Don't have a qualm of doubt about it. There's a

whole host of ministering spirits—angels some people call

them—I don't say I should myself—but there are legions

of mighty influences appointed to wait on just such brave steps as

you're about to take."
"That is, if I take them!"
"Oh, you'll take 'em all right, dearie. You'll not be able to

help it when you see just what they ought to be. In a certain sense

they'll take you. You'll be passed along from point to point as

safely as that bit of jade"—he took the carving from between

her fingers and held it up—"as safely as that bit of jade has

been transmitted from the quarries of Tibet to brighten my old

eyes. It's run no end of risks, but the Angel of Beauty has watched

over all its journeys. It's been in every sort of queer, mysterious

place; it's passed through the hands of mandarins, merchants, and

slaves; it's probably stood in palaces and been exposed in shops;

it's certainly come over mountains and down rivers and across seas;

and yet here it is, as perfect as when some sallow-faced dwarf of a

craftsman gave it the last touch of the tool a hundred years ago.

And that's the way it'll be with you, dearie. You may go through

some difficult places, but you'll come out as unscathed as my

little Chinaman. The Street called Straight is often a crooked one;

and yet it's the surest and safest route we can take from point to

point."

As, a few minutes later, she hurried homeward, this mystical

optimism was to her something like a rose to a sick

man—beautiful to contemplate, but of little practical

application in alleviating pain. Her mind turned away from it. It

turned away, too, from the pillar of cloud, of which the symbolism

began to seem deceptive. Under the stress of the moment the only

vision to which she could attain was that of the Misses Rodman

begging for the pitiful job of teaching Italian in a young ladies'

school. She remembered them vaguely—tall, scraggy,

permanently girlish in dress and manner, and looking their true

fifty only about the neck and eyes. With their mother they lived in

a pretty villa on the Poggio Imperiale, and had called on her

occasionally when she passed through Florence. The knowledge of

being indebted to them, of having lived on their modest substance

and reduced them to poverty, brought her to the point of shame in

which it would have been a comfort to have the mountains fall on

her and the rocks cover her from the gaze of men. She upbraided

herself for her blindness to the most obviously important aspect of

the situation. Now that she saw it, her zeal to "pay," by doing

penance in public, became tragic and farcical at once. The

absurdity of making satisfaction to Mrs. Rodman and Mrs. Clay, to

Fanny Burnaby and the Brown girls, by calling in the law, when less

suffering—to her father at least—would give them actual

cash, was not the least element in her humiliation.
She walked swiftly, seeing nothing of the cheerful stir around

her, lashed along by the fear that Peter Davenant might have left

Tory Hill. She was too intent on her purpose to perceive any change

in her mental attitude toward him. She was aware of saying to

herself that everything concerning him must be postponed; but

beyond that she scarcely thought of him at all. Once the interests

of the poor women who had trusted to her father had been secured,

she would have time to face the claims of this new creditor; but

nothing could be attempted till the one imperative duty was

performed.
Going up the stairs toward her father's room, the sound of

voices reassured her. Davenant was there still. That was so much

relief. She was able to collect herself, to put on something like

her habitual air of quiet dignity, before she pushed open the door

and entered.
Guion was lying on the couch with the rug thrown over him.

Davenant stood by the fireplace, endangering with his elbow a

dainty Chelsea shepherdess on the mantelpiece. He was smoking one

of Guion's cigars, which he threw into an ash-tray as Olivia came

in.
Conversation stopped abruptly on her appearance. She herself

walked straight to the round table in the middle of the room, and

for a second or two, which seemed much longer in space of time,

stood silent, the tips of her fingers just touching a packet of

papers strapped with rubber bands, which she guessed that Davenant

must have brought. Through her downcast lashes she could see,

thrown carelessly on the table, three or four strips, tinted blue

or green or yellow, which she recognized as checks.
"I only want to say," she began, with a kind of panting in her

breath—"I only want to say, papa, that if ... Mr. Davenant

will ... lend you the money ... I shall be ... I shall be ... very

glad."
Guion said nothing. His eyes, regarding her aslant, had in them

the curious receding light she had noticed once before. With a

convulsive clutching of the fingers he pulled the rug up about his

chin. Davenant stood as he had been standing when she came in, his

arm resting on the mantelpiece. When she looked at him with one

hasty glance, she noticed that he reddened hotly.
"I've changed my mind," she went on, impelled by the silence of

the other two to say something more. "I've changed my mind. It's

because of papa's clients—the Miss Rodmans and the

others—that I've done it. I couldn't help it. I never thought

of them till this afternoon. I don't know why. I've been very

dense. I've been cruel. I've considered only how we—papa and

I—could exonerate ourselves, if you can call it exoneration.

I'm sorry."
"You couldn't be expected to think of everything at once, Miss

Guion," Davenant said, clumsily.
"I might have been expected to think of this; but I didn't. I

suppose it's what you meant when you said that there were sides to

the question that I didn't see. You said it, too, papa. I wish you

had spoken more plainly."
"We talked it over, Miss Guion. We didn't want to seem to force

you. It's the kind of thing that's better done when it's done of

one's own impulse. We were sure you'd come to it. All the same, if

you hadn't done it to-day, we'd made up our minds to—to

suggest it. That's why I took the liberty of bringing these things.

Those are bonds that you've got your hand on—and the checks

make up the sum total."
By an instinctive movement she snatched her fingers away; but,

recovering herself, she took the package deliberately into her

hands and stood holding it.
"I've been explaining to Davenant," Guion said, in a muffled

voice, "that things aren't quite so hopeless as they seem. If we

ever come into Aunt Vic's money—"
"But there's no certainty of that, papa."
"No certainty, but a good deal of probability. She's always

given us to understand that the money wouldn't go out of her own

family; and there's practically no one left now but you and me. And

if it should come to us, there'd be more than enough

to—to square everything. You'd do it, dear, wouldn't you, if

Aunt Vic were to leave the whole thing to you? I think she's as

likely to do that as not."
"Mr. Davenant must know already that I shall give my whole life

to trying to pay our debt. If there's anything I could sign at

once—"
Davenant moved from the fireside. "There's nothing to sign, Miss

Guion," he said, briefly. "The matter is ended as far as I'm

concerned. Mr. Guion has got the money, and is relieved from his

most pressing embarrassments. That's all I care about. There's no

reason why we should ever speak of it again. If you'll excuse me

now—"
He turned toward the couch with his hand outstretched, but

during the minute or two in which Olivia and he had been facing

each other Guion had drawn the rug over his face. Beneath it there

was a convulsive shaking, from which the younger man turned away.

With a nod of comprehension to Olivia he tiptoed softly from the

room. As he did so he could see her kneel beside the couch and kiss

the hand that lay outside the coverlet.
She overtook him, however, when he was downstairs picking up his

hat and stick from the hall table.
She stood on the lowest step of the stairs, leaning on the low,

white pillar that finished the balustrade. He was obliged to pass

her on his way to the door. The minute was the more awkward for him

owing to the fact that she did not take the initiative in carrying

it off. On the contrary, she made it harder by looking at him

gravely without speaking.
"It's relief," he said, nodding with understanding toward the

room up-stairs. "I've seen men do that before—after they'd

been facing some danger or other with tremendous pluck."
He spoke for the sake of saying something, standing before her

with his hat and stick in his hand, not seeing precisely how he was

to get away.
"It's a relief to me, too," she said, simply. "You can't imagine

what it's been the last few days—seeing things go to pieces

like that. Now, I suppose, they'll hold together somehow, though it

can't be very well. I dare say you think me all wrong—"
He shook his head.
"I couldn't see any other way. When you've done wrong as we've

done it, you'd rather be punished. You don't want to go scot-free.

It's something like the kind of impulse that made the hermits and

ascetics submit to scourging. But it's quite possible that I

shouldn't have had the courage to go through with

it—especially if papa had broken down. As you said from the

first, I didn't see what was truly vital."
"I shouldn't blame myself too much for that, Miss Guion. It

often happens that one only finds the right way by making two or

three plunges into wrong ones."
"Do you think I've found it now?"
There was something wistful in the question, and not a little

humble, that induced him to say with fervor, "I'm very sure of

it."
"And you?" she asked. "Is it the right way for you?"
"Yes; and it's the first time I've ever struck it."
She shook her head slowly. "I don't know. I'm a little

bewildered. This morning everything seemed so clear, and

now—I understand," she went on, "that we shall be taking all

you have."
"Who told you that?" he asked, sharply.
"It doesn't matter who told me; but it's very important if we

are. Are we?"
He threw his head back in a way that, notwithstanding her

preoccupation, she could not but admire. "No; because I've still

got my credit. When a man has that—"
"But you'll have to begin all over again, sha'n't you?"
"Only as a man who has won one battle begins all over again when

he fights another. It's nothing but fun when you're fond of

war."
"Didn't I do something very rude to you—once—a long

time ago?"
The question took him so entirely unawares that, in the slight,

involuntary movement he made, he seemed to himself to stagger

backward. He was aware of looking blank, while unable to control

his features to a non-committal expression. He had the feeling that

minutes had gone by before he was able to say:
"It was really of no consequence—"
"Don't say that. It was of great consequence. Any one can see

that—now. I was insolent. I knew I had been. You

must have been perfectly aware of it all these years; and—I

will say it!—I must say it!—you're

taking your revenge—very nobly."
He was about to utter something in protest, but she turned away

abruptly and sped up the stairs. On the first landing she paused

for the briefest instant and looked down.
"Good-by," she faltered. "I must go back to papa. He'll need me.

I can't talk any more just now. I'm too bewildered—about

everything. Colonel Ashley will arrive in a day or two, and after

I've seen him I shall be a little clearer as to what I think;

and—and then—I shall see you again."
He continued to stand gazing up the stairway long after he had

heard her close the door of Guion's room behind her.

XI
I
t was not difficult for Davenant to ascribe his

lightness of heart, on leaving Tory Hill, to satisfaction in

getting rid of his superfluous money, since he had some reason to

fear that the possession of it was no great blessing. To a man with

little instinct for luxury and no spending tastes, twenty or thirty

thousand dollars a year was an income far outstripping his needs.

It was not, however, in excess of his desires, for he would gladly

have set up an establishment and cut a dash if he had known how. He

admired the grand style in living, not so much as a matter of

display, because presumably it stood for all sorts of mysterious

refinements for which he possessed the yearning without the

initiation. The highest flight he could take by his own unaided

efforts was in engaging the best suite of rooms in the best hotel,

when he was quite content with his dingy old lodgings; in driving

in taxicabs, when the tram-car would have suited him just as well,

and ordering champagne, when he would have preferred some commoner

beverage. Fully aware of the insufficiency of this method of

reaching a higher standard, he practised it only because it offered

the readiest means he could find of straining upward. He was sure

that with a wife who knew the arts of elegance to lead the way his

scent for following would be keen enough; but between him and the

acquisition of this treasure there lay the memory of the haughty

young creature who had, in the metaphor with which he was most

familiar, "turned him down."
But it was not the fact that he had more money than he needed of

which he was afraid; it was rather the perception that the

possibility of indulging himself—coupled with what he

conceived to be a kind of duty in doing it—was sapping his

vigor. All through the second year of his holiday he had noticed in

himself the tendency of the big, strong-fibered animal to be

indolent and overfed. On the principle laid down by Emerson that

every man is as lazy as he dares to be he got into the way of

sleeping late, of lounging in the public places of hotels, and

smoking too many cigars. With a little encouragement he could have

contracted the incessant cocktail and Scotch-and-soda habits of

some of his traveling compatriots.
He excused these weaknesses on the ground that when he had

returned to Boston, and got back to his ordinary round of work and

exercise, they would vanish, without having to be overcome; and yet

the nearer he drew to his old home, the less impulse he felt for

exertion. He found himself asking the question, "Why should I try

to make more money when I've got enough already?" to which the only

reply was in that vague hope of "doing a little good," inspired by

his visit to the scene of his parents' work at Hankow. In this

direction, however, his aptitudes were no more spontaneous than

they were for the life of cultivated taste. Henry Guion's need

struck him, therefore, as an opportunity. If he took other views of

it besides, if it made to him an appeal totally different from the

altruistic, he was able to conceal the fact—from himself, at

any rate—in the depths of a soul where much that was vital to

the man was always held in subliminal darkness. It disturbed him,

then, to have Drusilla Fane rifle this sanctuary with irreverent

persistency, dragging to light what he had kept scrupulously hidden

away.
Having found her alone in the drawing-room drinking her tea, he

told her at once what he had accomplished in the way of averting

the worst phase of the danger hanging over the master of Tory Hill.

He told her, too, with some amount of elation, which he explained

as his glee in getting himself down to "hard-pan." Drusilla allowed

the explanation to pass till she had thanked him ecstatically for

what he had done.
"Really, Peter, men are fine! The minute I heard Cousin Henry's

wretched story I knew the worst couldn't come to the worst, with

you here. I only wish you could realize what it means to have a

big, strong man like you to lean on."
Davenant looked pleased; he was in the mood to be pleased with

anything. He had had so little of women's appreciation in his life

that Drusilla's enthusiasm was not only agreeable but new. He

noticed, too, that in speaking Drusilla herself was at her best.

She had never been pretty. Her mouth was too large, her cheek-bones

too high, and her skin too sallow for that; but she had the charm

of frankness and intelligence.
Davenant said what was necessary in depreciation of his act,

going on to explain the benefit he would reap by being obliged to

go to work again. He enlarged on his plans for taking his old rooms

and his old office, and informed her that he knew a fellow, an old

pal, who had already let him into a good thing in the way of a

copper-mine in the region of Lake Superior. Drusilla listened with

interest till she found an opportunity to say:
"I'm so glad that is your reason for helping Cousin

Henry, Peter; because I was afraid there might

be—another."
He stopped abruptly, looking dashed. Unaccustomed to light

methods of attack and defense, it took him a few seconds to see

Drusilla's move.
"You thought I might be—in love?"
She nodded.
"That's queer," he went on, "because I'd got the same impression

about you."
It was Drusilla's turn to be aghast. She was a little surprised

at not being offended, too.
"What made you think that?" she managed to ask, after getting

command of herself.
"What makes one think anything? However," he conceded, "I dare

say I'm wrong."
"That's a very good conclusion to come to. I advise you to keep

to it."
"I will if you'll do the same about me."
She seized the opening to carry the attack back in his

direction.
"I can't make a bargain of that kind, Peter. The scientific mind

bases its conclusions on—observed phenomena."
"Which I guess is the reason why the scientific mind is so often

wrong. I've had a good deal to do with it in the copper-mine

business. It's always barking up the wrong tree. I've often heard

it said that the clever scientist is generally a poor

reasoner."
"Well, perhaps he is. But I wasn't reasoning. I was merely going

by instinct when I thought you might have a special motive for

helping Cousin Henry. If you had, you know, it wouldn't be any

harm."
"It mightn't be any harm; but would it be any good?"
"Well, that might depend a good deal—on you."
"On me? How so? I don't know what you're driving at."
"I'm not driving at anything. I'm only speculating. I'm

wondering what I should do if I were in your place—with all

your advantages."
"Rot, Drusilla!"
"If I were a man and had a rival," Drusilla persisted, "I should

be awfully honorable in the stand I'd take toward him—just

like you. But if anything miscarried—"
"You don't expect anything to miscarry?"
She shook her head. "No; I don't expect it. But it might be a

fortunate thing if it did."
"You don't mean to infer that this man Ashley mightn't come up

to the scratch?"
"Colonel Ashley has come up to a good many scratches in his

time. He's not likely to fail in this one."
"Well, then, what more is there to it?"
"There's a good deal more. There are things I can't explain, and

which you wouldn't understand if I did. Coming up to the scratch

isn't everything. Charles the First came up to the scratch when he

walked up and had his head cut off; but there was more to be

said."
"And you mean that your Colonel Ashley would be brave enough to

walk up and have his head cut off?"
"I know he'd be brave enough. It's no question of courage. He

had the Victoria Cross before he was thirty. But it's a noble head;

and it might be a pity it should have to fall."
"But I don't understand why it should."
"No, you wouldn't unless you'd lived among them. They'd all

admit he had done the right thing. They'd say that, having come out

here to marry her, he could do no less than go through with it.

That part of it would be all right. Even in the Rangers it might

make comparatively little difference—except that now and then

Olivia would feel uncomfortable. Only when he was mentioned at the

Horse Guards for some important command they'd remember that there

was something queer—something shady—about his wife's

family, and his name would be passed over."
He nodded thoughtfully. "I see."
"Oh no, you don't. It's much too intricate for you to see. You

couldn't begin to understand how poignant it might become,

especially for her, without knowing their ways and

traditions—"
He jumped to his feet. "Their ways and traditions

be—!"
"Yes; that's all very fine. But they're very good ways, Peter.

They've got to keep the honor of the Service up to a very high

standard. Their ways are all right. But that doesn't keep them from

being terrible forces to come up against, especially for a proud

thing like her. And now that the postponing of the wedding has got

into the papers—"
"Yes; I've seen 'em. Got it pretty straight, too, all things

considered."
"And that sort of thing simply flies. It will be in the New York

papers to-morrow, and in the London ones the day after. We always

get those things cabled over there. We know about the elopements

and the queer things that happen in America when we don't hear of

anything else. Within forty-eight hours they'll be talking of it at

the Rangers' dépôt in Sussex—and at

Heneage—and all through his county—and at the Horse

Guards. You see if they aren't! You've no idea how people have

their eye on him. And when they hear the wedding has been put off

for a scandal they'll have at their heels all the men who've hated

him—and all the women who've envied her—"
He leaned his shoulders against the mantelpiece, his hands

behind his back. "Pooh! That sort of dog can only bark."
"No; that's where you're wrong, Peter. In England it can bite.

It can raise a to-do around their name that will put a dead stop to

his promotion—that is, the best kind of promotion, such as

he's on the way to."
"The deuce take his promotion! Let's think

of—her."
"That's just what I thought you'd do, Peter; and with all your

advantages—"
"Drop that, Drusilla," he commanded. "You know you don't mean

it. You know as well as I do that I haven't a chance—even if

I wanted one—which I don't. You're not thinking of

me—or of her. You're thinking of him—and how to get him

out of a match that won't tend to his advancement."
"I'm thinking of every one, Peter—of every one but myself,

that is. I'm thinking of him, and her, and you—"
"Then you'll do me a favor if you leave me out."
She sprang to her feet, her little figure looking slim and

girlish.
"I can't leave you out, Peter, when you're the Hamlet of the

piece. That's nonsense. I'm not plotting or planning on any one's

behalf. It isn't my temperament. I only say that if this—this

affair—didn't come off—though I suppose it will—I

feel sure it will—yet if it didn't—then, with all your

advantages—and after what you've done for her—"
He strode forward, almost upsetting the tea-table beside which

she stood. "Look here, Drusilla. You may as well understand me once

for all. I wouldn't marry a girl who took me because of what I'd

done for her, not if she was the last woman in the world."
"But you would if she was the first, Peter. And I'm convinced

that for you she is the first—"
"Now, now!" he warned her, "that'll do! I've been generous

enough not to say anything as to who's first with you, though you

don't take much pains to hide it. Why not—?"
"You're all first with me," she protested. "I don't know which

of you I'm the most sorry for."
"Don't waste your pity on me. I'm perfectly happy. There's only

one of the lot who needs any consideration whatever. And, by God!

if he's not true to her, I'll—"
"Your intervention won't be called for, Peter," she assured him,

making her way toward the door. "You're greatly mistaken if you

think I've asked for it."
"Then for Heaven's sake what have you asked for?

I don't see."
She was in the hall, but she turned and spoke through the

doorway. "I've only asked you not to be an idiot. I merely beg, for

all our sakes, that if something precious is flung down at your

feet you'll have the common sense to stoop and pick it up."
"I'll consider that," he called after her, as she sped up the

stairs, "when I see it lying there."

XII
I
t may be admitted at once that, on arriving at

Tory Hill and hearing from Olivia's lips the tale of her father's

downfall, Colonel Rupert Ashley received the first perceptible

check in a very distinguished career. Up to this point the

sobriquet of "Lucky Ashley," by which he was often spoken of in the

Rangers, had been justified by more than one spectacular success.

He had fulfilled so many special missions to uncivilized and

half-civilized and queerly civilized tribes that he had come to

feel as if he habitually went on his way with the might of the

British Empire to back him. It was he who in South Africa brought

the M'popos to order without shedding a drop of blood; it was he

who in the eastern Soudan induced the followers of the Black

Prophet to throw in their lot with the English, securing by this

move the safety of Upper Egypt; it was he who in the Malay

Peninsula intimidated the Sultan of Surak into accepting the

British protectorate, thus removing a menace to the peace of the

Straits Settlements. Even if he had had no other exploits to his

credit, these alone would have assured his favor with the home

authorities. It had become something like a habit, at the Colonial

Office or the War Officer or the Foreign Office, as the case might

be, whenever there was trouble on one of the Empire's vague outer

frontiers, to ask, "Where's Ashley?" Wherever he was, at Gibraltar

or Simla or Cairo or at the Rangers' dépôt in Sussex,

he was sent for and consulted. Once having gained a reputation for

skill in handling barbaric potentates, he knew how to make the most

of it, both abroad and in Whitehall. On rejoining his regiment,

too, after some of his triumphant expeditions, he was careful to

bear himself with a modesty that took the point from detraction,

assuring, as it did, his brother-officers that they would have done

as well as he, had they enjoyed the same chances.
He was not without a policy in this, since from the day of

receiving his commission he had combined a genuine love of his

profession with a quite laudable intention to "get on." He

cherished this ambition more naturally, perhaps, than most of his

comrades, who took the profession of arms lightly, for the reason

that the instinct for it might be said to be in his blood. The

Ashleys were not an old county family. Indeed, it was only a

generation or so since they had achieved county rank. It was a fact

not generally remembered at the present day that the grandfather of

the colonel of the Sussex Rangers had been a successful and

estimable manufacturer of brushes. In the early days of Queen

Victoria he owned a much-frequented emporium in Regent Street, at

which you could get anything in the line from a tooth-brush to a

currycomb. Retiring from business in the fifties, with a

considerable fortune for the time, this Mr. Ashley had purchased

Heneage from the impoverished representatives of the Umfravilles.

As luck would have it, the new owners found a not unattractive Miss

Umfraville almost going with the place, since she lived in select

but inexpensive lodgings in the village. Her manners being as

gentle as her blood, and her face even gentler than either, if such

a thing could be, it was in keeping with the spirit that had borne

the Ashleys along to look upon her as an opportunity. Young Mr.

Ashley, to whom his father had been able to give the advantages of

Oxford, knew at a glance that with this lady at his side

recognition by the county would be assured. Being indifferent to

recognition by the county except in so far as it expressed a phase

of advancement, and superior to calculation as a motive for the

matrimonial state, young Ashley proceeded with all due formality to

fall in love; and it was from the passion incidental to this

episode that Lucky Ashley was born.
All this had happened so long ago, according to modern methods

of reckoning, that the county had already forgotten what it was the

original Ashley had manufactured, or that he had manufactured

anything at all. By the younger generation it was assumed that

Heneage had passed to the Ashley family through intermarriage with

the Umfravilles. Certain it was that the Ashleys maintained the

Umfraville tradition and used the Umfraville arms. What chiefly

survived of the spirit that had made the manufacture of brushes so

lucrative a trade was the intention young Rupert Ashley took with

him into the army—to get on.
He had got on. Every one spoke of him nowadays as a coming man.

It was conceded that when generals like Lord Englemere or Lord

Bannockburn passed away, it would be to such men as Rupert

Ashley—the number of them could be counted on the fingers of

your two hands!—that the country would look for its

defenders. They were young men, comparatively, as yet; but they

were waiting and in training. It was a national asset to know that

they were there.
It was natural, then, that Ashley's eyes should be turning in

the direction of the great appointments. He had won so much

distinction in the Jakh War and the Dargal War that there was

nothing to which, with time, he could not aspire. True, he had

rivals; true, there were men who could supplant him without putting

any great strain upon their powers; true, there were others with

more family influence, especially of that petticoat influence which

had been known to carry so much weight in high and authoritative

quarters; but he had confidence in himself, in his ability, his

star—the last named of which had the merit of always seeming

to move forward.
Everything began to point, therefore, to his marrying. In a

measure it was part of his qualification for high command. He had

reached that stage in his development, both private and

professional, at which the co-operation of a good and graceful wife

would double his capacity for public service, besides giving him

that domestic consolation of which he began to feel the need. There

were posts he could think of—posts that would naturally be

vacant before many years were past—in which the fact of his

being unmarried would be a serious drawback if his name were to

come up. Better to be unmarried than to be saddled with a wife who

from any deficiency of birth or manner was below the level of her

station! Of course! He had seen more than one man, splendidly

qualified otherwise, passed over because of that mischance. But

with a wife who in her way was equal to him in his they would both

go far. Who could venture to say how far?
In this respect he was fortunate in knowing exactly what he

wanted. That is, he had seen enough of the duties of high position

to be critical of the ladies who performed them. Experience enabled

him to create his ideal by a process of elimination. Many a time,

as he watched some great general's wife—Lady Englemere, let

us say, or Lady Bannockburn—receive her guests, he said to

himself, "That is exactly what my wife shall not be." She should

not be a military intrigante like the one, nor a female martinet

like the other, nor a gambler like a third, nor a snob like a

fourth, nor a fool about young men like several he could think of.

By dint of fastidious observation and careful rejection of the

qualities of which he disapproved, a vision rose before him of the

woman who would be the complement of himself. He saw her clever,

spirited, high-bred—a woman of the world, familiar with

literature and arts, and speaking at least one language besides her

mother-tongue. In dress she should be exquisite, in conversation

tactful, in manner sympathetic. As mistress of the house she should

be thorough; as a hostess, full of charm; as a mother—but his

imagination hardly went into that. That she should be a perfect

mother he took for granted, just as he took it for granted that she

should be beautiful. A woman who had the qualifications he desired

could not be less than beautiful from the sheer operation of the

soul.
Considering how definite his ideas were—and moderate, on

the whole—it surprised him to find no one to embody them. It

sometimes seemed to him that the traditional race of Englishwomen

had become extinct. Those he met were either brilliant and hard, or

handsome and horsey, or athletic and weedy, or smart and selfish,

or pretty and silly, or sweet and provincial, or good and

grotesque. With the best will in the world to fall in love, he

found little or no temptation. Indeed, he had begun to think that

the type of woman on whom he had set his heart was, like some

article of an antiquated fashion, no longer produced when

unexpectedly he saw her.
He saw her unexpectedly, because it was at church; and whatever

his motives on that bright Sunday morning in May in attending the

old garrison chapel in Southsea, the hope of seeing his vision

realized was not one. If, apart from the reasons for which people

are supposed to go to church, he had any special thought, it was

that of meeting Mrs. Fane. It had happened two or three times

already that, having perceived her at the service, he had joined

her on the Common afterward, and she had asked him home to lunch.

They had been pleasant little luncheons—so pleasant that he

almost regretted the fact that she was an American. He had nothing

against Americans in themselves. He knew a number of their women

who had married into one arm or another of the Service with

conspicuous advantage to their husbands. That, in fact, was part of

the trouble. There were so many of them nowadays that he had begun

to feel vaguely that where there was question of high

position—and he hoped modestly that in his case there was

distinctly question of that—it was time the principle was

being established of England for the English. Nevertheless, he had

got so far in his consideration of Drusilla Fane as to ask himself

whether she was not, as the widow of a British officer, an

Englishwoman to all intents and purposes as well as in the strict

letter of the law. He could not say that he was in love with her;

but neither could he say that one of these days he might not be. If

he ever were it would certainly be on the principle of faute de

mieux; but many a man has chosen his wife on no better ground

than that.
Such criticism as he had to make to her disadvantage he could

form there and then in the chapel while they were reading the

lessons or chanting the psalms. She sat two or three rows in front

of him, on the other side of the aisle. There was something about

Drusilla in church that suggested a fish out of water. He had

noticed it before. She was restless, inattentive; she kept turning

her head to see who was behind her or at the other end of the pew;

she rarely found the places in the prayer-book or knew just when to

kneel down; when she did kneel down she sank into an awkward little

bunch; every now and then she stifled, or did not stifle, a

yawn.
Ashley had a theory that manner in church is the supreme test of

the proprieties. He knew plenty of women who could charm at a

dinner or dazzle at a dance, but who displayed their weaknesses at

prayer. All unwitting to herself, poor Drusilla was inviting his

final—or almost final—judgment on her future, so far at

least as he was concerned, for the simple reason that she twitched

and sighed and forgot to say the Amens.
And just then his eyes traveled to her neighbor—a tall

young lady, dressed in white, with no color in her costume but a

sash of hues trembling between sea-green and lilac. She was slender

and graceful, with that air at once exquisite and unassuming that

he had seen in the Englishwoman of his dreams. Though he could get

no more than a side glimpse of her face, he divined that it was

pure and that it must be thrown into relief by the heavy coil of

coppery-brown hair. But what he noticed in her first was that which

he thought of concerning other women last—a something holy

and withdrawn, a quality of devotion without which he had no

conception of real womanhood. It seemed to be a matter of high

courtesy with her not to perceive that the choir-boys sang out of

tune or that the sermon was prosy. In the matter of kneeling he had

seen only one woman in his life—and she the highest in the

land—who did it with this marvelous grace at once dignified

and humble. "It takes old England," he said to himself, gloatingly,

"to make 'em like that—simple

and—stunning."
But on the Common after service, and at luncheon after that, and

during the three or four weeks that ensued, he had much to do in

reforming his opinions. There were several facts about Olivia Guion

that disorientated his points of view and set him looking for new

ones. Though he was not wholly successful in finding them, he

managed, nevertheless, to justify himself for falling in love in

violation of his principles. He admitted that he would have

preferred to marry a compatriot of his own, and some one above the

rank of a solicitor's daughter; but, since he had discovered the

loveliest and noblest creature in the world, it was idle to cavil

because one land or one situation in life rather than another had

produced her. As well complain of the rubies and pearls that deck

the English crown because some were found in Tibetan mountains and

others in Indian seas. There are treasures, he argued, so precious

as to transcend all merely national limitations, making them petty

and irrelevant. The one thing to the point was that in Olivia Guion

he had won the human counterpart of himself, who could reflect his

qualities and complete them.

He had been so proud that the blow on receiving Olivia's letter

in New York was a cruel one. Though it told him nothing but that

her father had lost all his money and that the invitations to the

wedding had been withdrawn, this in itself was immeasurably

distressing to a man with a taste for calling public attention to

his movements and who liked to see what concerned him march with a

certain pomp. His marriage being an event worthy to take place in

sight of the world, he had not only found ways of making it a topic

of interest before leaving England, but he had summoned to it such

friends of distinction as he possessed on the American side of the

water. Though he had not succeeded in getting the British

Ambassador, Benyon, the military attaché at Washington, was

to come with his wife, and Lord Woolwich, who was aide-de-camp at

Ottawa, had promised to act as best man. His humiliation on

speculating as to what they must have said when they received

Olivia's card announcing that the marriage was not to take place on

the 28th was such that he fell to wondering whether it wouldn't

have been better to bluff the loss of money. They might have

carried out their plans in spite of it. Indeed he felt the

feasibility of this course the more strongly after he had actually

seen Olivia and she had given him the outlines of her tale.
Watching his countenance closely, she saw that he blanched.

Otherwise he betrayed no sign of flinching. His manner of sitting

rigid and upright in his corner of the rustic seat was a perfectly

natural way of listening to a story that affected him so closely.

What distressed her chiefly was the incongruity between his

personality and the sordid drama in which she was inviting him to

take part. He was even more distinguished-looking than he appeared

in the photographs she cherished or in the vision she had retained

in her memory. Without being above the medium male height, he was

admirably shaped by war, sport, and exercise. His neat head, with

its thick, crispy hair, in which there was already a streak of

gray, was set on his shoulders at just the right poise for command.

The high-bridged nose, inherited from the Umfravilles, was of the

kind commonly considered to show "race." The eyes had the

sharpness, and the thin-lipped mouth the inflexibility, that go

with a capacity for quick decisions. While he was not so imposing

in mufti as in his uniform, the trim traveling-suit of russet brown

went well with the bronze tint of the complexion. It was so healthy

a bronze, as a usual thing, that his present pallor was the more

ashen from contrast.
Knowing from his telegram the hour at which to expect him, she

had gone down the driveway to meet him when she saw him dismiss his

taxicab at the gate. She chose to do this in order that their first

encounter might take place out-of-doors. With the windows of the

neighboring houses open and people sitting on verandas or passing

up and down the road, they could exchange no more than some

conventional greeting. She would assume nothing on the ground of

their past standing toward each other. He seemed to acquiesce in

this, since he showed no impatience at being restricted to the

formality of shaking hands.
Happily for both, commonplace words were given

them—questions and answers as to his voyage, his landing, his

hotel. He came to her relief, too, as they sauntered toward the

house, by commenting on its dignity and Georgian air, as well as by

turning once or twice to look at the view. Nearing the steps she

swerved from the graveled driveway and began to cross the lawn.
"We won't go in just yet," she explained. "Papa is there. He

felt he ought to dress and come downstairs to receive you. He's

very far from well. I hope you'll do your best not to—to

think of him too harshly."
"I shouldn't think harshly of any one simply because he'd had

business bad luck."
"He has had business bad luck—but that isn't all.

We'll sit here."
Taking one corner of a long garden-seat that stood in the shade

of an elm, she signed to him to take the other. On the left they

had the Corinthian-columned portico of the garden front of the

house; in the distance, the multicolored slopes of the town.

Olivia, at least, felt the stimulating effect of the, golden

forenoon sunshine.
As for Ashley, in spite of his outward self-possession, he was

too bewildered to feel anything at all. Having rushed on from New

York by night, he was now getting his first daylight glimpse of

America; and, though, owing to more urgent subjects for, thought,

he was not consciously giving his attention to things outward, he

had an oppressive sense of immensity and strangeness. The arch of

the sky was so sweeping, the prospect before them so gorgeous, the

sunlight so hard, and the distances so clear! For the first time in

his life a new continent aroused in him an odd sense of antagonism.

He had never had it in Africa or Asia or in the isles of the

Southern Sea. There he had always gone with a sense of power, with

the instinct of the conqueror; while here.... But Olivia was

speaking, saying things too appalling for immediate

comprehension.
Her voice was gentle and even; she spoke with a certain kind of

ease. She appeared to rehearse something already learned by

heart.
"So, you see, he didn't merely lose his own money; he lost

theirs—the money of his clients—which was in his trust.

I hadn't heard of it when I wrote you in New York, otherwise I

should have told you. But now that you know it—"
He looked mystified. "He's jolly lucky not to be in England," he

said, trying not to seem as stunned as he felt. "There that sort of

thing is a very serious—"
"Offence," she hastened to say. "Oh, so it is here. I must tell

you quite plainly that if the money hadn't come papa would have had

to go to—"
"But the money did come?"
She made a point of finishing her sentence. "If the money hadn't

come papa would have had to go to prison. Yes, the money did come.

A friend of—of papa's—and Drusilla's—advanced it.

It's been paid over to the people who were going to law."
"So that part of it is settled?"
"That part of it is settled to the extent that no action will be

taken against papa."
She continued to talk on gently, evenly, giving him the facts

unsparingly. It was the only way. Her very statements, so it seemed

to her, implied that as marriage between them was no longer

possible their engagement was at an end.
She was not surprised that he scarcely noticed when, having said

all she had to say, she ceased speaking. Taking it for granted that

he was thinking out the most merciful way of putting his verdict

into words, she, too, remained silent. She was not impatient, nor

uneasy, nor alarmed. The fact that the business of telling him was

no longer ahead of her, that she had got it over, brought so much

relief that she felt able to await his pleasure.
She mistook, however, the nature of his thoughts. Once he had

grasped the gist of her information, he paid little attention to

its details. The important thing was his own conduct. Amid

circumstances overwhelmingly difficult he must act so that every

one, friend or rival, relative, county magnate or brother officer,

the man in his regiment or the member of his club, the critic in

England or the onlooker in America, should say he had done

precisely the right thing.
He used the words "precisely the right thing" because they

formed a ruling phrase in his career. For twenty-odd years they had

been written on the tablets of his heart and worn as frontlets

between his brows. They had first been used in connection with him

by a great dowager countess now deceased. She had said to his

mother, apropos of some forgotten bit of courtliness on his part,

"You can always be sure that Rupert will do precisely the right

thing." Though he was but a lad at Eton at the time, he had been so

proud of this opinion, expressed with all a dowager countess's

authority, that from the moment it was repeated to him by his

mother he made it a device. It had kept him out of more scrapes

than he could reckon up, and had even inspired the act that would

make his name glorious as long as there were annals of the Victoria

Cross.
He had long been persuaded that had the dowager countess not

thus given the note to his character his record would never have

been written on that roll of heroes. "I should have funked it," was

his way of putting it, by which he meant that he would have funked

it through sheer ignorance of himself and of his aptitude for the

high and noble. It was an aptitude that flourished best under an

appreciative eye—of the dowager countess looking down from

heaven—or of the discerning here on earth—as an actor

is encouraged by a sympathetic public to his highest histrionic

efforts. If there was anything histrionic in Ashley himself, it was

only in the sense that he was at his finest when, actually or

potentially, there was some one there to see. He had powers then of

doing precisely the right thing which in solitude might have been

dormant from lack of motive.
It was undoubtedly because he felt the long-sighted eyes of

England on him that he had done precisely the right thing in

winning the Victoria Cross. He confessed this—to himself. He

confessed it often—every time, in fact, when he came to a

difficult passage in his life. It was his strength, his

inspiration. He confessed it now. If he sat silent while Olivia

Guion waited till it seemed good to him to speak, it was only that

he might remind himself of the advantages of doing the right thing,

however hard. He had tested those advantages time and time again.

The very memories they raised were a rebuke to weakness and

hesitation. If he ever had duties he was inclined to shirk, he

thought of that half-hour which had forever set the seal upon his

reputation as a British soldier.
He thought of it now. He saw himself again looking up at the

bristling cliffs that were to be rushed, whence the Afridis were

pouring their deadly fire. He saw himself measuring with his eye

the saddle of precipitous slope that had to be crossed, devoid of

cover and strewn with the bodies of dead Ghurkas. Of the actual

crossing, with sixty Rangers behind him, he had little or no

recollection. He had passed under the hail of bullets as through

perils in a dream. As in a dream, too, he remembered seeing his

men, when he turned to cheer them on, go down like

nine-pins—throwing up their arms and staggering, or twisting

themselves up like convulsive cats. It was grotesque rather than

horrible; he felt himself grinning inwardly, as at something

hellishly comic, when he reached the group of Ghurkas huddled under

the cavernous shelter of the cliff. Then, just as he threw himself

on the ground, panting like a spent dog and feeling his body all

over to know whether or not he had been wounded, he saw poor

Private Vickerson out in the open, thirty yards from the protection

of the wall of rock. While the other Rangers to a man were lying

still, on the back with the knees drawn up, or face downward, with

the arms outstretched, or rolled on the side as though they were in

bed, Vickerson was rising on his hands and dragging himself

forward. It was one of Ashley's most vivid recollections that

Vickerson's movements were like a seal's. They had the drollery of

a bit of infernal mimicry. It was also a vivid recollection that

when he ran out to the soldier's aid he had his first sensation of

fear. The bullets whizzed so thick about him that he ran back

again. It was an involuntary running back, as involuntary as

snatching his fingers out of a fire. He could remember standing

under the rock, and, as Vickerson did not move, half hoping he were

dead. That would put an end to any further attempts to save him.

But the soldier stirred again, propping himself with both hands and

pulling his body onward for a few inches more. Again Ashley ran out

into a tempest of iron and fire and over ground slippery with

blood. He could still feel himself hopping back, as a barefooted

boy who has ventured into a snow-storm hops back into the house. A

third time he ran out, and a fourth. At the fourth he distinctly

worded the thought which had been at the back of his mind from the

beginning, "I shall get the V.C. for this." He tried to banish the

unworthy suggestion, but it was too strong for him. Over the

cliffs, and out of the clouds, and from beyond the horizon, he felt

the unseen eyes of England upon him, inciting him to such a valor

that at the fifth attempt he dragged in his man.
He came out of this reverie, which, after all, was brief, to

find the gentle tones in which Olivia had made her astounding

revelations still in his ears; while she herself sat expectant, and

resigned. He knew she was expectant and resigned and that she had

braced her courage for the worst. With many men, with most men, to

do so would have been needful. In the confusion of his rapid

summaries and calculations it was a pleasurable thought that she

should learn from him, and through him and in him, that it was not

so with all. The silence which at first was inadvertent now became

deliberate as—while he noted with satisfaction that he had

not overstated to himself the exquisite, restrained beauty of her

features, her eyes, her hair, her hands, and of the very texture

and fashion of her clothing—he prolonged the suspense which

was to be the prelude to his justifying once again the dowager

countess's good opinion. It was to his credit as a brave man that

he could nerve himself for this with his eyes wide open—wider

open than even Mrs. Fane's—to to the consequences that might

be in store for him.

XIII
A
shley had the tact, sprung of his English

instinct for moderation, not to express his good intentions too

directly. He preferred to let them filter out through a seemingly

casual manner of taking them for granted. Neither did he attempt to

disguise the fact that the strangeness incidental to meeting again,

in trying conditions and under another sky, created between himself

and Olivia a kind of moral distance across which they could draw

together only by degrees. It was a comfort to her that he did not

try to bridge it by anything in the way of forced tenderness. He

was willing to talk over the situation simply and quietly until, in

the course of an hour or two, the sense of separation began to wear

away.
The necessity on her part of presenting Ashley to her father and

offering him lunch brought into play those social resources that

were as second nature to all three. It was difficult to think the

bottom could be out of life while going through a carefully chosen

menu and drinking an excellent vin de Graves at a table

meticulously well appointed. To escape the irony of this situation

they took refuge in the topics that came readiest, the novelty to

Ashley of the outward aspect of American things keeping them on

safe ground till the meal was done. It was a relief to both men

that Guion could make his indisposition an excuse for retiring

again to his room.
It was a relief to Olivia, too. For the first time in her life

she had to recognize her father as insupportable to any one but

herself and Peter Davenant. Ashley did his best to conceal his

repulsion; she was sure of that; he only betrayed it negatively in

a tendency to ignore him. He neither spoke nor listened to him any

more than he could help. By keeping his eyes on Olivia he avoided

looking toward him. The fact that Guion took this aversion humbly,

his head hanging and his attention given to his plate, did not make

it the less poignant.
All the same, as soon as they were alone in the dining-room the

old sense of intimacy, of belonging to each other, suddenly

returned. It returned apropos of nothing and with the exchange of a

glance. There was a flash in his eyes, a look of wonder in

hers—and he had taken her, or she had slipped, into his

arms.
And yet when a little later he reverted to the topic of the

morning and said, "As things are now, I really don't see why we

shouldn't be married on the 28th—privately, you know," her

answer was, "What did you think of papa?"
Though he raised his eyebrows in surprise that she should

introduce the subject, he managed to say, "He seems pretty

game."
"He does; but I dare say he isn't as game as he looks. There's a

good deal before him still."
"If we're married on the 28th he'd have one care the less."
"Because I should be taken off his hands. I'm afraid that's not

the way to look at it. The real fact is that he'd have nobody to

help him."
"I've two months' leave. You could do a lot for him in that

time."
She bent over her piece of work. It was the sofa-cushion she had

laid aside on the day when she learned from Davenant that her

father's troubles were like Jack Berrington's. They had come back

for coffee to the rustic seat on the lawn. For the cups and coffee

service a small table had been brought out beside which she sat.

Ashley had so far recovered his sang-froid as to be able to enjoy a

cigar.
"Would you be very much hurt," she asked, without raising her

head, "if I begged you to go back to England without our being

married at all?"
"Oh, but I say!"
The protest was not over-strong. He was neither shocked nor

surprised. A well-bred woman, finding herself in such trouble as

hers, would naturally offer him some way of escape from it.
"You see," she went on, "things are so complicated already that

if we got married we should complicate them more. There's so much

to be done—as to papa—and this house—and the

future—of the kind of thing you don't know anything about.

They're sordid things, too, that you'd be wasted on if you tried to

learn them."
He smiled indulgently. "And so you're asking me—a

soldier!—to run away."
"No, to let me do it. It's so—so impossible that I can't

face it."
"Oh, nonsense!" He spoke with kindly impatience. "Don't you love

me? You said just now—in the

dining-room—when—"
"Yes, I know; I did say that. But, you see—we

must consider it—love can't be the most important

thing in the world for either you or me."
"I understand. You mean to say it's duty. Very good. In that

case, my duty is as plain as a pikestaff."
"Your duty to stand by me?"
"I should be a hound if I didn't do it."
"And I should feel myself a common adventuress if I were to let

you."
"Oh—I say!"
His protest this time was more emphatic. There was even a

pleading note in it. In the course of two or three hours he had got

back much of the feeling he had had in England that she was more

than an exquisite lady, that she was the other part of himself. It

seemed superfluous on her part to fling open the way of retreat for

him too wide.
She smiled at his exclamation. "Yes, I dare say that's how it

strikes you. But it's very serious to me. Isn't it serious to you,

too, to feel that you must be true to me—and marry

me—after all that's come to pass?"
"One doesn't think that way—or speak that way—of

marrying the woman one—adores."
"Men have been known to marry the women they adored, and still

regret the consequences they had to meet."
"She's right," he said to himself. "It is serious."
There could be no question as to her wisdom in asking him to

pause. At his age and in his position, and with his merely normal

capacity for passion, it would be absurd to call the world well

lost for love. Notwithstanding his zeal to do the right thing,

there was something due to himself, and it was imperative that he

should consider it. Dropping the stump of his cigar into his empty

coffee-cup, he got up and strode away. The emotion of the minute,

far in excess of the restrained phrases convention taught them to

use, offered an excuse for his unceremoniousness.
He walked to the other side of the lawn, then down to the gate,

then round to the front of the house. To a chance passer-by he was

merely inspecting the premises. What he saw, however, was not the

spectacular foliage, nor the mellow Georgian dwelling, but himself

going on his familiar victorious way, freed from a clogging scandal

that would make the wheels of his triumphal car drive heavily. He

saw himself advancing, as he had advanced hitherto, from promotion

to promotion, from command to command. He saw himself first alone,

and then with a wife—a wife who was not Olivia Guion. Then

suddenly the vision changed into something misty and undefined; the

road became dark, the triumphal car jolted and fell to pieces;

there was reproach in the air and discomfort in his sensations. He

recognized the familiar warnings that he was not doing precisely

the right thing. He saw Olivia Guion sitting as he had left her

four or five minutes before, her head bent over her stitching. He

saw her there, deserted, alone. He saw the eyes of England on him,

as he drove away in his triumphal car, leaving her to her fate. His

compunction was intense, his pity overwhelming. Merely at turning

his back on her to stroll around the lawn he felt guilty of a

cowardly abandonment. And he felt something else—he felt the

clinging of her arms around his neck; he felt the throb of her

bosom against his own as she let herself break down just for a

second—just for a sob. It seemed to him that he should feel

that throb forever.
He hurried back to where he had left her. "It's no use," he said

to himself; "I'm in for it, by Jove. I simply can't leave her in

the lurch."
There was no formal correctness about Ashley's habitual speech.

He kept, as a rule, to the idiom of the mess, giving it distinction

by his crisp, agreeable enunciation.
Olivia had let the bit of embroidery rest idly in her lap. She

looked up at his approach. He stood before her.
"Do I understand," he asked, with a roughness assumed to conceal

his agitation, "that you're offering me my liberty?"
"No; that I'm asking you for mine."
"On what grounds?"
She arched her eyebrows, looking round about her

comprehensively. "I should think that was clear. On the grounds

of—of everything."
"That's not enough. So long as you can't say that you

don't—don't care about me any more—"
There was that possibility. It was very faint, but if she made

use of it he should consider it decisive. Doing precisely the right

thing would become quite another course of action if her heart

rejected him. But she spoke promptly.
"I can't say that; but I can say something more important."
He nodded firmly. "That settles it, by Jove. I sha'n't give you

up. There's no reason for it. So long as we love each

other—"
"Our loving each other wouldn't make your refusal any the less

hard for me. As your wife I should be trying to fill a position for

which I'm no longer qualified and in which I should be a

failure."
"As my wife," he said, slowly, with significant deliberation,

"we could make the position anything you felt able to fill."
She considered this. "That is, you could send in your papers and

retire into private life."
"If we liked."
"So that you'd be choosing between your career—and

me."
"I object to the way of putting it. If my career, as you call

it, didn't make you happy, you should have whatever would do the

trick."
"I'm afraid you'll think me captious if I say that nothing

could do it. If you weren't happy, I couldn't be; and

you'd never be happy except as a soldier."
"That trade would be open to me whatever happened."
"In theory, yes; but in practice, if you had a wife who was

under a cloud you'd have to go under it, too. That's what it would

come to in the working-out."
She stood up from sheer inability to continue sitting still. The

piece of embroidery fell on the grass. Ashley smiled at her—a

smile that was not wholly forced, because of the thoughts with

which she inspired him. Her poise, her courage, the something in

her that would have been pride if it had not been nearer to

meekness and which he had scarcely called meekness before he felt

it to be fortitude, gave him confidence in the future. "She's

stunning—by Jove!" It seemed to him that he saw her for the

first time. For the first time since he had known her he was less

the ambitious military officer seeking a wife who would grace a

high position than he was a man in love with a woman. Separating

these two elements within himself, he was able to value her

qualities, not as adornments to some Home or Colonial Headquarters

House, but as of supreme worth for their own sake. "People have

only got to see her," he said, inwardly, to which he added

aloud:
"I dare say the cloud may not be so threatening, after all; and

even if it is, I should go under it with the pluckiest woman in the

world."
She acknowledged this with a scarcely visible smile and a slight

inclination of the head. "Thank you; I'm foolish enough to like to

hear you say it. I think I am plucky—alone. But I

shouldn't be if I involved anybody else."
"But if it was some one who could help you?"
"That might be different, but I don't know of any one who could.

You couldn't. If you tried you'd only injure yourself

without doing me any good."
"At the least, I could take you away from—from all

this."
"No, because it's the sort of thing one can never leave behind.

It's gone ahead of us. It will meet us at every turn. You and

I—and papa—are probably by to-day a subject for gossip

in half the clubs in New York. To-morrow it will be the same thing

in London—at the club you call the Rag—and the Naval

and Military—and your different Service clubs—"
To hide the renewal of his dismay he pooh-poohed this

possibility. "As a mere nine days' wonder."
"Which isn't forgotten when the nine days are past. Long after

they've ceased speaking of it they'll remember—"
"They'll remember," he interrupted, fiercely, "that I jilted

you."
She colored hotly. "That you—what?"
He colored, too. The words were as much a surprise to him as to

her. He had never thought of this view of the case till she herself

summoned up the vision of his friends and enemies discussing the

affair in big leather arm-chairs in big, ponderous rooms in

Piccadilly or St. James's Square. It was what they would say, of

course. It was what he himself would have said of any one else. He

had a renewed feeling that retreat was cut off.
"If we're not married—if I go home without you—it's

what'll be on everybody's lips."
"But it won't be true," she said, with a little gasp.
He laughed. "That won't matter. It's how it'll look."
"Oh, looks!"
"It's what we're talking about, isn't it? It's what makes the

difference. I shall figure as a cad."
He spoke as one who makes an astounding discovery. She was

inexpressibly shocked.
"Oh, but you couldn't," was all she could find to say, but she

said it with conviction.
"THERE'S NO ONE WHO WON'T BELIEVE BUT THAT I—THREW YOU OVER."

"THERE'S NO ONE WHO WON'T BELIEVE BUT THAT

I—THREW YOU OVER."

He laughed again. "You'll see. There's no one—not my best

friends—not my mother—not my sisters—who won't

believe—whatever you and I may say to the contrary—who

won't believe but that I—threw you over."
A toss of his hand, a snap of his fingers, suited the action to

the word.
Her color came and went in little shifting flashes. She moved a

pace or two aimlessly, restively. Her head went high, her chin

tilted. When she spoke her voice trembled with indignation, but she

only said:
"They couldn't believe it long."
"Oh, couldn't they! The story would follow me to my grave.

Things like that are never forgotten among fellows so intimate as

soldiers. There was a chap in our regiment who jilted a nice girl

at the Cape—sailed for home secretly only a week before the

wedding." He paused to let her take in the dastardly nature of the

flight. "Well, he rejoined at the dépôt. He

stayed—but he didn't stay long. The Rangers got too hot for

him—or too cold. The last I ever heard of him he was giving

English lessons at Boulogne."
The flagrancy of the case gave her an advantage. "It's idle to

think that that kind of fate could overtake you."
"The fate that can overtake me easily enough is that as long as

I live they'll say I chucked a girl because she'd had bad

luck."
She was about to reply when the click of the latch of the gate

diverted her attention. Drusilla Fane, attended by Davenant, was

coming up the hill. Seeing Olivia and Ashley at the end of the

lawn, Drusilla deflected her course across the grass, Davenant in

her wake. Her wide, frank smile was visible from a long way

off.
"This is not indiscretion," she laughed, as she advanced;

"neither is it vulgar curiosity to see the lion. I shouldn't have

come at all if mother hadn't sent me with a message."
Wearing a large hat à la Princesse de Lamballe

and carrying a long-handled sunshade which she held daintily, like

a Watteau shepherdess holding a crook, Drusilla had an air of

refined, eighteenth-century dash. Knowing the probability that she

disturbed some poignant bit of conversation, she proceeded to take

command, stepping up to Olivia with a hasty kiss. "Hello, you dear

thing!" Turning to Ashley, she surveyed him an instant before

offering her hand. "So you've got here! How fit you look! What sort

of trip did you have, and how did you leave your people? And, oh,

by the way, this is Mr. Davenant."
Davenant, who had been paying his respects to Miss Guion,

charged forward, with hand outstretched and hearty: "Happy to meet

you, Colonel. Glad to welcome you to our country."
"Oh!"
Ashley snapped out the monosyllable in a dry, metallic voice

pitched higher than his usual key. The English softening of the

vowel sound, so droll to the American ear, was also more pronounced

than was customary in his speech, so that the exclamation became a

sharp "A-ow!"
Feeling his greeting to have been insufficient, Davenant

continued, pumping up a forced rough-and-ready cordiality. "Heard

so much about you, Colonel, that you seem like an old friend. Hope

you'll like us. Hope you'll enjoy your stay."
"Oh, indeed? I don't know, I'm sure."
Ashley's glance shifted from Drusilla to Olivia as though asking

in some alarm who was this exuberant bumpkin in his Sunday clothes

who had dropped from nowhere. Davenant drew back; his face fell. He

looked like a big, sensitive dog hurt by a rebuff. It was Mrs. Fane

who came to the rescue.
"Peter's come to see Cousin Henry. They've got business to talk

over. And mother wants to know if you and Colonel Ashley won't come

to dinner to-morrow evening. That's my errand. Just ourselves, you

know. It'll be very quiet."
Olivia recovered somewhat from the agitation of the previous

half-hour as well as from the movement of sudden, inexplicable

anger which Ashley's reception of Davenant had produced in her.

Even so she could speak but coldly, and, as it were, from a long

way off.
"You'll go," she said, turning to Ashley, "and I'll come if I

can leave papa. I'll run up flow and see how he is and take Mr.

Davenant with me."

XIV
T
here was dignity in the way in which Davenant

both withdrew and stood his ground. He was near the Corinthian

portico of the house as Olivia approached him. Leaning on his

stick, he looked loweringly back at Ashley, who talked to Drusilla

without noticing him further. Olivia guessed that in Davenant's

heart there was envy tinged with resentment, antipathy, not

tempered by a certain unwilling admiration. She wondered what it

was that made the difference between the two men, that gave Ashley

his very patent air of superiority. It was a superiority not in

looks, since Davenant was the taller and the handsomer; nor in

clothes, since Davenant was the better dressed; nor in the moral

make-up, since Davenant had given proofs of unlimited generosity.

But there it was, a tradition of self-assurance, a habit of command

which in any company that knew nothing about either would have made

the Englishman easily stand first.
Her flash of anger against the one in defense of the other

passed away, its place being taken by a feeling that astonished her

quite as much. She tried to think it no more than a pang of

jealousy at seeing her own countryman snubbed by a foreigner. She

was familiar with the sensation from her European, and especially

her English, experiences. At an unfriendly criticism it could be

roused on behalf of a chance stranger from Colorado or California,

and was generally quite impersonal. She told herself that it was

impersonal now, that she would have had the same impulse of

protection, of championship, for any one.
Nevertheless, there was a tone in her voice as she joined him

that struck a new note in their acquaintanceship.
"I'm glad you came when you did. I wanted you to meet Colonel

Ashley. You'll like him when you know him better. Just at first he

was a little embarrassed. We'd been talking of things—"
"I didn't notice anything—that is, anything different from

any other Englishman."
"Yes; that's it, isn't it? Meeting an Englishman is often like

the first plunge into a cold bath—chilling at first, but

delightful afterward."
He stopped under the portico, to say with a laugh that was not

quite spontaneous: "Yes; I dare say. But my experience is limited.

I've never got to the—afterward."
"Oh, well, you will," she said, encouragingly, "now that you

know Colonel Ashley."
"I've heard of men plunging into a cold bath and finding it so

icy that they've popped out again."
"Yes; thin-blooded men, who are sensitive to chills. Not men

like you."
They entered the house, lingering in the oval sitting-room

through which they had to pass.
"Fortunately," he tried to say, lightly, "it doesn't matter in

this case whether I'm sensitive to chills or not."
"Oh, but it does. I want you two to be friends."
"What for?" The question was so point-blank as to be a little

scornful, but she ignored that.
"On Colonel Ashley's side, for what he'll gain in knowing you;

on yours—for something more."
He stopped again, at the foot of the staircase in the hall. "May

I ask—just what you mean by that?"
She hesitated. "It's something that a tactful person wouldn't

tell. If I do, it's only because I want you to consider me

as—your friend. I know you haven't hitherto," she hurried on,

as he flushed and tried to speak. "I haven't deserved it. But after

what's happened—and after all you've done for us—"
"I could consider you my friend without asking Colonel Ashley to

think of me as his."
"Hardly—if I marry him; and besides—when you know

him—You see," she began again, "what I have in mind depends

upon your knowing him—rather well."
"Then, Miss Guion," he laughed, "you can drop it. I've sized him

up with a look. I've seen others like him—at Gibraltar and

Malta and Aden and Hongkong and Cairo, and wherever their old flag

floats. They're a fine lot. He's all right for you—all right

in his place. Only, the place isn't—mine."
"Still," she persisted, "if I marry him you'd be sometimes in

England; and you'd come to visit us, wouldn't you?"
"Come and—what?" His astonishment made him speak

slowly.
She took a step or two up the stairway, leaning on the banister

in a way to prevent his advancing. She was now looking down at him,

instead of looking up.
"Isn't it true—?" she said, with hesitation—"at

least I've rather guessed it—and I've gathered it from things

Drusilla has said about you—You see," she began once more,

"if we're to be friends you mustn't mind my speaking frankly and

saying things that other people couldn't say. You've intervened so

much in my life that I feel you've given me a right

to—intervene—in yours."
"Oh, intervene as much as you like, Miss Guion," he said,

honestly.
"Well, then, isn't it true that there are things you've

wanted—wanted very much—and never had? If so—and

I marry Colonel Ashley—"
"Hold on! Let's see what you mean by—things. If it's

visiting round in high society—"
He tried to render as scorn his dismay at this touching on his

weakness.
"I don't mean anything so crude. Visiting round in high society,

as you call it, would at best be only the outward and visible sign

of an inward—and, perhaps, spiritual—experience of the

world. Isn't that what you've wanted? You see, if I do marry

Colonel Ashley, I could—don't be offended!—I could open

a door to you that you've never been able to force for

yourself."
"You mean get me into society."
"You needn't be so disdainful. I didn't mean that—exactly.

But there are people in the world different from those you meet in

business—and in their way more interesting—certainly

more picturesque. They'd like you if they knew you—and I had

an idea that you—rather craved—After all, it's nothing

to be ashamed of. It's only making the world bigger for oneself,

and—"
Backing away from the stairway, he stood on a rug in the middle

of the hall, his head hung like a young bull about to charge.
"What made you think of it?"
"Isn't that obvious? After you've done so much for

me—"
"I haven't done anything for you, Miss Guion. I've said so a

good many times. It wouldn't be right for me to take payment for

what you don't owe me. Besides, there's nothing I want."
"That is to say," she returned, coldly, "you prefer the

rôle of benefactor. You refuse to accept the little I might

be able to do. I admit that it isn't much—but it's

something—something within my power, and which I

thought you might like. But since you don't—"
"It's no question of liking; it's one of admitting a principle.

If you offer me a penny it's in part payment for a pound, while I

say, and say again, that you don't owe me anything. If there's a

debt at all it's your father's—and it's not

transferable."
"Whether it's transferable or not is a matter that rests between

my father and me—and, of course, Colonel Ashley, if I marry

him."
He looked at her with sudden curiosity. "Why do you always say

that with—an 'if'?"
She reflected an instant. "Because," she said, slowly, "I can't

say it in any other way."
He straightened himself; he advanced again to the foot of the

stairway.
"Is that because of any reason of—his?"
"It's because of a number of reasons, one of which is mine. It's

this—that I find it difficult to go away with one

man—when I have to turn my back upon the overwhelming debt I

owe another. I do owe it—I do. The more I try to

ignore it, the more it comes in between me and—"
He pressed forward, raising himself on the first step of the

stairs, till his face was on a level with hers. He grew red and

stammered:
"But, Miss Guion, you're—you're—in love with

him?—the man you'd be going away with?"
She nodded. "Yes; but that wouldn't help me to feel justified

with regard to the—the duty—I was leaving behind."
He dropped again to the level of the hall. "I don't understand.

Do you mean to say that what I've done for Mr. Guion would keep you

from getting married?"
"I'm not prepared to say that. Colonel Ashley is so—so

splendid in the way he takes everything that—But I'll say

this much," she began again, "that you've made it hard for

me to be married."
"How so? I thought it would be all the other way."
"If you'll put yourself in my place—or in Colonel Ashley's

place—you'll see. Try to think what it means for two people

like us to go away—and be happy—and live in a great,

fashionable world—and be people of some

importance—knowing that some one else—who was nothing

to us, as we were nothing to him—had to deprive himself of

practically everything he had in the world to enable us to do

it."
"But if it was a satisfaction to him—"
"That wouldn't make any difference to us. The facts would be the

same."
"Then, as far as I see, I've done more harm than good."
"You've helped papa."
"But I haven't helped you."
"As I understand it, you didn't want to."
"I didn't want to—to do the reverse."
"Perhaps it wouldn't be the reverse if you could condescend to

let me do something for you. It would be the fair exchange which is

no robbery. That's why I suggest that if I'm to have

that—that life over there—you should profit by its

advantages."
He shook his head violently. "No, Miss Guion. Please don't think

of it. It's out of the question. I wish you'd let me say once for

all that you owe me nothing. I shall never accept anything from

you—never!"
"Oh!" It was the protest of one who has been hurt.
"I'll take that back," he said, instantly. "There is

something you can do for me and that I should like. Marry your

Englishman, Miss Guion, and do what you said just now—go away

and be happy. If you want to give me a reward, I'll take that."
She surveyed him a minute in astonishment. "You're perfectly

extraordinary," she said at last, in a tone of exasperation,

"and"—she threw at him a second later—"and

impossible!"
Before he could reply she went grandly up the stairway, so that

he was obliged to follow her. In the hall above she turned on him

again. Had he not known that he had given her no cause for offence

he would have said that her eyes filled with tears.
"Things are very hard as it is," she said, reproachfully. "You

needn't go out of your way to make them gratuitously cruel."
"But, Miss Guion—" he began to protest.
"Please go in," she commanded, throwing open, as she spoke, the

door of her father's room.

XV
M
eanwhile, down on the lawn, Drusilla and Ashley

were talking things over from their own points of view. There had

been a second of embarrassment when they were first left alone,

which Drusilla got over by pointing with her parasol to an

indistinguishable spot in the stretch of tree-tops, spires, and

gables sloping from the gate, saying:
"That's our house—the one with the little white

cupola."
He made no pretense to listen or to look. "She says she doesn't

want to marry me."
He made the statement dispassionately, as though laying down a

subject for academic discussion.
It was some little time before she could think what to say.
"Well, that doesn't surprise me," she risked at last.
"Doesn't surprise you?"
She shook her head. "On the contrary, I should be very much

astonished if she did—now. I should be astonished at any

woman in her position wanting to marry a man in yours."
"I don't care a hang for my position."
"Oh yes, you do. And even if you didn't, it wouldn't matter.

It's naturally a case in which you and she have to see from

different angles. With you it's a point of honor to stand by her;

with her it's the same thing not to let you."
"In honor it's the positive, not the negative, that takes

precedence, and the positive happens to be mine."
"I don't think you can argue that way, you know. What takes

precedence of everything else is—common sense."
"And do you mean to say that common sense requires that she

shall give me up?"
"I shouldn't go so far as to assert that. But I shouldn't mind

saying that if she did give you up there'd be a lot of common sense

in her doing it."
"On whose account? Mine?"
"Yes; and hers. Perhaps chiefly on hers. You can hardly realize

the number of things she has to take care of—and you'd be one

more."
"I confess I don't seize your drift."
"It's not very abstruse, however. Just think. It isn't as if

Cousin Henry had fallen ill, or had died, or had gone to pieces in

any of the ordinary ways. Except for his own discomfort, he might

just as well have been tried and sentenced and sent to prison. He's

been as good as there. Every one knows it's only a special

providence that he didn't go. But if he's escaped that by the skin

of his teeth, he hasn't escaped a lot of other things. He hasn't

escaped being without a penny in the world. He hasn't escaped

having his house sold over his head and being turned out into the

streets. He hasn't escaped reaching a perfectly impotent old age,

with not a soul on this earth to turn to but Olivia."
"What about me?"
"Would you take him?"
"I shouldn't take him exactly. If he was my

father-in-law"—he made a little grimace—"I suppose I

could pension him off somewhere, or board him out, like an old

horse. One couldn't have him round."
"H'm! I dare say that would do—but I doubt it. If you'd

ever been a daughter you might feel that you couldn't dispose of a

poor, old, broken-down father quite so easily. After all, he's not

a horse. You might more or less forsake him when all was going

well, and yet want to stick to him through thick and thin if he

came a cropper. Look at me! I go off and leave my poor old dad for

a year and more at a time—because he's a saint; but if he

wasn't—especially if he'd got into any such scrape as Cousin

Henry's—which isn't thinkable—but if he did—I'd

never leave him again. That's my temperament. It's every girl's

temperament. It's Olivia's. But all that is neither here nor there.

If she married you, her whole life would be given up to trying to

make you blend with a set of circumstances you couldn't possibly

blend with. It would be worse than singing one tune to an orchestra

playing another. She'd go mad with the attempt."
"Possibly; except for one factor which you've overlooked."
"Oh, love! Yes, yes. I thought you'd say that." Drusilla tossed

her hands impatiently. "Love will do a lot, but it won't do

everything. You can't count on it to work miracles in a

sophisticated company like the Sussex Rangers. They've passed the

age of faith for that sort of thing."
"I don't see," he said, speaking very slowly, "that the Rangers

need be altogether taken into consideration."
She looked at him fixedly. "Do you mean that you'd—send in

your papers?"
"Only in the sense that if my wife wasn't happy in the Service

we could get out of it."
"Then you're really so much in love that you'd be willing to

throw up everything on account of it?" There was some incredulity

in her tone, to which, however, he offered no objection.
"Willing or unwilling isn't to the point. Surely you see that as

far as public opinion goes I'm dished either way. The more I think

of it the plainer it becomes. If I marry Olivia I let myself in for

connection with a low-down scandal; if I don't, then they'll say I

left her in the lurch. As for the effect on any possible promotion

there might be in store for me, it would be six of one and half a

dozen of the other. If I married her, and there was something good

to be had, and old Bannockburn, let us say, was at the Horse

Guards, then Lady Ban wouldn't have Olivia; and if I didn't marry

her, and there was the same situation with old Englemere in

command, then he wouldn't have me. There it is in a

nutshell—simply nothing to choose."
They proceeded to stroll aimlessly up and down the lawn.
"I can quite see how it looks from your point of view—"

she began.
"No, you can't," he interrupted, sharply, "because you leave out

the fact that I am—I don't mind saying it—that is, to

you—you've been such a good pal to me!—I shall never

forget it!—but I am—head over

heels—desperately—in love."
Having already heard this confession in what now seemed the

far-off days in Southsea, she could hear it again with no more than

a sense of oppression about the heart.
"Yes," she smiled, bravely. "I know you are. And between two

ills you choose the one that has some compensation attached to

it."
"Between two ills," he corrected, "I'm choosing the only course

open to a man of honor. Isn't that it?"
There was a wistful inflection on the query. It put forth at one

and the same time a request for corroboration and a challenge to a

contrary opinion. If there could be no contrary opinion, he would

have been glad of some sign of approval or applause. He wanted to

be modest; and yet it was a stimulus to doing precisely the right

thing to get a little praise for it, especially from a woman like

Drusilla.
In this for once she disappointed him. "Of course you are," she

assented, even too promptly.
"And yet you're advising me," he said, returning to the charge,

"to make a bolt for it—and leave Olivia to shift for

herself."
"If I remember rightly, the question you raised was not about

you, but about her. It wasn't as to whether you should marry her,

but as to whether she should marry you. I'm not disputing your

point of view; I'm only defending Olivia's. I can see three good

reasons why you should keep your word to her—"
"Indeed? And what are they?"
She told them off on her fingers. "First, as you can't do

anything else. Second—"
"Your first reason," he interrupted, hastily, as though he

feared she suspected him of not being convinced of it, "covers the

whole ground. We don't need the rest."
"Still," she insisted, "we might as well have them. Second, it's

the more prudent of two rather disadvantageous courses.

Third—to quote your own words—you're head over heels in

love with her. It's easy to see that now, and now another of these

reasons is uppermost in your mind; but it's also easy to see that

none of them makes a conclusive appeal to Olivia Guion. That's the

point."
"The point is that I'm in love with her, and—if it's not

claiming too much—she with me. We've nothing else to

consider."
"You haven't. She has. She has all the things I've just hinted

at—and ever so many more; besides which," she added, taking a

detached, casual tone, "I suppose she has to make up her mind one

way or another as to what she's going to do about Peter

Davenant."
The crow's-foot wrinkles about his eyes deepened to a frown of

inquiry. "About Peter—who?"
Drusilla still affected a casual tone. "Oh? Hasn't she told you

about him?"
"Not a word. Who is he?"
She nodded in the direction of the house. "He's up-stairs with

Cousin Henry."
"The big fellow who was here just now? That—lumpkin?"
"Yes," she said, dryly, "that—lumpkin. It was he who gave

Cousin Henry the money to meet his liabilities."
"So he's the Fairy Prince? He certainly doesn't look it."
"No; he doesn't look it; but he's as much of a problem to Olivia

as if he did."
"Why? What has he to do with her?"
"Nothing, except that I suppose she must feel very

grateful."
They reached the edge of the lawn where a hedge of dahlias

separated them from the neighboring garden.
"When you say that," he asked, "do you mean anything in

particular?"
"I suppose I mean everything in particular. The situation is one

in which all the details count."
"And the bearing of this special detail—"
"Oh, don't try to make me explain that. In the first place, I

don't know; and in the second, I shouldn't tell you if I did. I'm

merely giving you the facts. I think you're entitled to know

them."
"So I should have said. Are there many more? I've had a lot

since I landed. I thought I must have heard pretty well all there

was—"
"Probably you had, except just that. I imagine Olivia found it

difficult to speak of, and so I'm doing it for her."
"Why should she find it difficult to speak of? It's a mere

matter of business, I suppose."
"If it's business to give Cousin Henry what would be nearly a

hundred thousand pounds in English money, with no prospect that any

one can see of his ever getting it back—that is, not unless

old Madame de Melcourt—"
"Oh, I say! Then he's one of your beastly millionaires, by

Jove!—grind the noses off the poor, and that sort of thing,

to play Haroun-al-Raschid with the cash."
"Not in the least. He never ground the nose off any one; and as

for being a millionaire, father says that what he's done for Cousin

Henry will pretty well clean him out."
"All the same, he's probably done it with a jolly sharp eye to

the main chance."
"Oh, I dare say his motives weren't altogether altruistic. Only

it's a little difficult to see where the main chance comes in."
"Then what the deuce is he up to?"
"I'm afraid I can't tell you that. I repeat that I'm only giving

you the facts. You must interpret them for yourself."
He looked thoughtful. Drusilla plucked a scarlet dahlia and

fastened it in her dress, after which they strolled back slowly to

the middle of the lawn. Here Ashley said:
"Has all this got anything to do with Olivia? I wish you

wouldn't make mysteries."
"I'm not making mysteries. I'm telling you what's happened just

as it occurred. He advanced the money to Cousin Henry, and that's

all I know about it. If I draw any inferences—"
"Well?"
"I'm just as likely to be wrong as right."
"Then you have drawn inferences?"
"Who wouldn't? I should think you'd be drawing them

yourself."
They wandered on a few yards, when he stopped again. "Look

here," he said, with a sort of appealing roughness, "you're quite

straight with me, aren't you?"
The rich, surging color came swiftly into her face, as wine seen

through something dark and transparent. Her black eyes shone like

jet. She would have looked tragic had it not been for her fixed,

steady smile.
"Have I ever been anything else with you?"
"No. You've been straight as a die. I'll say that for you.

You've been a good pal—a devilish good pal! But over

here—in America—everything seems to go by

enigmas—and puzzles—and surprises—"
"I'll explain what I can to you," she said, with a heightened

color, "but it won't be so very easy. There are lots of people who,

feeling as I do—toward Olivia—and—and toward

you—would want to beat about the bush. But when all these

things began to happen—and you were already on the

way—I turned everything over in my mind and decided to speak

exactly as I think."
"Good!"
"But it isn't so very easy," she repeated, pretending to

rearrange the dahlia in her laces, so as to find a pretext for not

looking him in the eyes. "It isn't so very easy; and if—later

on—in after years perhaps—when everything is long

over—it ever strikes you that I didn't play fair—it'll

be because I played so fair that I laid myself open to

that imputation. One can, you know. I only ask you to remember it.

That's all."
Ashley was bewildered. He could follow little more than half of

what she said. "More mysteries," he was sighing to himself as she

spoke. "And such a color! That's her strong point. Pity it only

comes by fits and flashes. But, good Lord, what a country! Always

something queer and new."
"Good-by," she said, offering her hand before he had time to

emerge from his meditations. "We shall see you to-morrow evening.

And, by the way, we dine at half-past seven. We're country people

here, and primitive. No; don't come to the gate. Olivia must be

wondering where you are."
He looked after her as she tripped over the lawn toward the

roadway, still holding her long-handled, beribboned,

eighteenth-century sunshade with the daintiness of a Watteau

shepherdess holding a crook.
"She's a good 'un," he said to himself. "Straight as a die, she

is—and true as steel."
None the less he was glad when she left him.

XVI
A
shley wanted to be alone. He needed solitude in

order to face the stupendous bit of information Mrs. Fane had given

him. Everything else he had heard during the past twenty-four hours

he had felt himself more or less competent to meet. True, his

meeting it would be at a sacrifice and the probable loss of some of

the best things he had hoped and worked for; but he should have the

satisfaction that comes to every man of honor when he has done a

brave thing well. There would be something, too, in giving the lie

to people who accused him of having no thought but for his own

advancement. He had been sensitive to that charge, because of the

strain of truth in it, and yet had seen no means of counteracting

it. Very well; he should counteract it now.
Since there was no way out of the situation he had found in

America—that is, no way consistent with self-respect—it

was characteristic of him, both as diplomatist and master of

tactics, to review what was still in his favor. He called himself

to witness that he had wasted no time in repining. He had risen to

the circumstances as fast as nature would permit, and adapted

himself right on the spur of the moment to an entirely new outlook

on the future. Moreover, he had been able to detach Olivia herself

from the degrading facts surrounding her, seeing her, as he had

seen her from the first, holy and stainless, untouched by

conditions through which few women could pass without some personal

deterioration. In his admiration and loyalty he had not wavered for

a second. On the contrary, he was sure that he should love her the

more intensely, in spite of, and perhaps because of, her

misfortunes.
He felt free, therefore, to resent this new revelation so

fantastically out of proportion to the harmony of life. It was the

most staggering thing he had ever heard of. An act such as that

with which Drusilla credited Davenant brought into daily existence

a feature too prodigious to find room there. Or, rather, having

found the room through sheer force of its own bulk, it dwarfed

everything else into insignificance. It hid all objects and blocked

all ways. You could get neither round it nor over it nor through

it. You could not even turn back and ignore it. You could only

stand and stare at it helplessly, giving it the full tribute of

awe.
Ashley gave it. He gave it while lighting mechanically a cigar

which he did not smoke and standing motionless in the middle of the

lawn, heedless of the glances—furtive, discreet, sympathetic,

admiring—cast at him from the windows and balconies of the

surrounding houses. His quick eye, trained to notice everything

within its ken, saw them plainly enough. The houses were not so

distant nor the foliage so dense but that kindly, neighborly

interest could follow the whole drama taking place at Tory Hill.

Ashley could guess with tolerable accuracy that the ladies whom he

saw ostensibly reading or sewing on verandas had been invited to

the wedding, and were consequently now in the position of

spectators at a play. The mere detail of this American way of

living, with unwalled properties merging into one another, and

doors and windows flung wide to every passing glance, gave him an

odd sense of conducting his affairs in the market-place or on the

stage. If he did not object to it, it was because of the incitement

to keep up to the level of his best which he always drew from the

knowledge that other people's eyes were upon him.
He felt this stimulus when Olivia came out to the Corinthian

portico, seating herself in a wicker chair, with an obvious

invitation to him to join her. "Drusilla Fane has been telling me

about your—your friend."
She knew he meant the last two words to be provocative. She knew

it by slight signs of nervousness in his way of standing before

her, one foot on the grass and the other on the first step of the

portico. He betrayed himself, too, in an unsuccessful attempt to

make his intonation casual, as well as by puffing at his cigar

without noticing that it had gone out. An instant's reflection

decided her to accept his challenge. As the subject had to be met,

the sooner it came up the better.
She looked at him mildly. "What did she say about him?"
"Only that he was the man who put up the money."
"Yes; he was."
"Why didn't you tell me that this morning?"
"I suppose because there was so much else to say. We should have

come round to it in time. I did tell you everything but his

name."
"And the circumstances."
"How do you mean—the circumstances?"
"I got the impression from you this morning that it was some

millionaire Johnny who'd come to your father's aid by advancing the

sum in the ordinary way of business. I didn't understand that it

was a comparatively poor chap who was cleaning himself out to come

to yours."
In wording his phrase he purposely went beyond the warrant, in

order to rouse her to denial, or perhaps to indignation. But she

said only:
"Did Drusilla say it was to come to my aid?"
"She didn't say it—exactly. I gathered that it was what

she thought."
She astonished him by saying, simply: "I think so, too."
"Extraordinary! Do you mean to say he dropped out of a clear

sky?"
"I must answer that by both a yes and a no. He did drop out of a

clear sky just lately; but I'd known him before."
"Ah!" His tone was that of a cross-examiner dragging the truth

from an unwilling witness. He put his questions rapidly and

sharply, as though at a Court-martial. "So you'd known him before!

Did you know him well?"
"I didn't think it was well; but apparently he did,

because he asked me to marry him."
Ashley bounded. "Who? That—that cowboy!"
"Yes; if he is a cowboy."
"And you took money from him?"
Her elbows rested on the arm of her chair; the tip of her chin

on the back of her bent fingers. Without taking her eyes from his

she inclined her head slowly in assent.
"That is," he hastened to say, in some compunction, "your father

took it. We must keep the distinction—"
"No; I took it. Papa was all ready to decline it. He had made up

his mind—"
"Do you mean that the decision to accept it rested with

you?"
"Practically."
"You didn't—" He hesitated, stammered, and grew red. "You

didn't—" he began again. "You'll have to excuse the

question.... I simply must know, by Jove!... You didn't

ask him for it?"
She rose with dignity. "If you'll come in I'll tell you about

it. We can't talk out here."
He came up the portico steps to the level on which she was

standing. "Tell me that first," he begged.
"You didn't ask him for it? Did you?"
In the French window, as she was about to enter the room, she

half turned round. "I don't think it would bear that construction;

but it might. I'd rather you judged for yourself. I declined it at

first—and then I said I'd take it. I don't know whether you'd

call that asking. But please come in."
He followed her into the oval room, where they were screened

from neighborly observation, while, with the French window open,

they had the advantage of the air and the rich, westering sunshine.

Birds hopped about in the trees, and now and then a gray squirrel

darted across the grass.
"I should think," he said, nervously, before she had time to

begin her explanation, "that a fellow who had done that for you

would occupy your mind to the exclusion of everybody else."
Guessing that he hoped for a disclaimer on her part, she was

sorry to be unable to make it.
"Not to their exclusion—but perhaps—a little to

their subordination."
He pretended to laugh. "What a pretty distinction!"
"You see, I haven't been able to help it. He's loomed up so

tremendously above everything—"
"And every one."
"Yes," she admitted, with apologetic frankness, "and every

one—that is, in the past few days—that it's as if I

couldn't see anything but him."
"Oh, I'm not jealous," he exclaimed, pacing up and down the

length of the room.
"Of course not," she agreed, seating herself in one of the

straight-backed chairs. Her clasped hands rested on the small round

table in the center of the room, while she looked out across the

lawn to the dahlias and zinnias on its farther edge.
Ashley, who had flung his panama on a sofa, continued to pace up

and down the room, his head bent and his fingers clasped tightly

under his jacket behind his back. He moved jerkily, like a man

preserving outward self-control in spite of extreme nervous

tension.
He listened almost without interruption while she gave him a

precise account of Davenant's intervention in her father's

troubles. She spared no detail of her own opposition and eventual

capitulation. She spoke simply and easily, as though repeating

something learned by heart, just as she had narrated the story of

Guion's defaulting in the morning. Apart from the fact that she

toyed with a paper-knife lying on the table, she sat rigidly still,

her eyes never wandering from the line of autumn flowers on the far

side of the lawn.
"So you see," she concluded, in her quiet voice, "I came to

understand that it was a choice between taking it from him and

taking it from the poor women papa had ruined; and I thought that

as he was young—and strong—and a man—he'd be

better able to bear it. That was the reason."
He came to a standstill on the other side of the table, where he

could see her in profile.
"You're extraordinary, by Jove!" he muttered. "You're not a bit

like what you look. You look so fragile and tender; and yet you

could have let that old man—"
"I could only have done it if it was right. Nothing that's right

is very hard, you know."
"And what about the suffering?"
She half smiled, faintly shrugging her shoulders. "Don't you

think we make more of suffering than there's any need for?

Suffering is nothing much—except, I suppose, the suffering

that comes from want. That's tragic. But physical pain—and

the things we call trials—are nothing so terrible if you know

the right way to bear them."
The abstract question didn't interest him. He resumed his

restless pacing.
"So," he began again, in his tone of conducting a

court-martial—"so you refused the money in the first place,

because you thought the fellow was trying to get you into his

power. Have you had any reason to change your opinion since?"
"None, except that he makes no effort to do it."
He stopped again beside the table. "And do you suppose he would?

When you've prepared your ambush cleverly enough you don't have to

go out and drag your victim into it. You've only to lie still and

he'll walk in of his own accord."
"Of course I see that."
"Well, what then?"
She threw him a glance over her shoulder. To do so it was

necessary for her to turn her head both sidewise and upward, so

that he got the exquisite lines of the neck and profile, the

mysterious gray-green tint of the eyes, and the coppery gleam of

her hair. The appeal to his senses and to something beyond his

senses made him gasp. It made him tremble. "My God, what a wife for

me!" he was saying to himself. "She's got the pluck of a

Jeanne d'Arc and the nerve of a Christian martyr."
"Well, then," she said, in answer to his words—"then I

don't have to walk into the ambush—unless I want to."
"Does that mean that there are conceivable conditions in which

you might want to?"
She turned completely round in her chair. Both hands, with

fingers interlaced, rested on the table as she looked up at

him.
"I shall have to let you find your own reply to that."
"But you know he's in love with you."
"I know he was in love with me once. I've no absolute reason to

think that he is so still."
"But supposing he was? Would it make any difference to you?"
"Would it make any difference to you?"
"It would make the difference—"
He stopped in confusion. While he was not clear as to what he

was going to say, he was startled by the possibilities before him.

The one thing plain was that her question, simple as it seemed,

gave an entirely new turn to the conversation. It called on him to

take the lead, and put him, neatly and skilfully, in the one place

of all others which—had he descried it in advance—he

would have been eager to avoid. Would it make any difference to

him? What difference could it make? What difference

must it make?
It was one of those moments which occur from time to time when a

man of honor must speak first and reflect afterward—just as

at the heights of Dargal he had had to risk his life for Private

Vickerson's, without debating as to which of them, in the general

economy of lives, could the more easily be spared.
"It would make the difference—"
He stopped again. It was a great deal to say. Once he had said

it there could be no reconsideration. Reconsideration would be

worse than not saying it at all, on the principle that not to stand

by one's guns might be a greater cowardice than not to mount them.

Fear, destruction, and the pit might come upon him; the service,

the country, Heneage, home, honors, ambitions, promotions, high

posts of command, all might be swept into the abyss, and yet one

imperative duty would survive the wreck, the duty to be Rupert

Ashley at his finest. The eyes of England were on him. There was

always that conviction, that incentive. Let his heroism be never so

secret, sooner or later those eyes would find him out.
He was silent so long that she asked, not impatiently: "It would

make what difference, Rupert?"
It was clear that she had no idea as to what was passing in his

mind. There had been an instant—just an instant—no

more—when he had almost doubted her, when her strategy in

putting him where he was had seemed too deft to be the result of

chance. But, with her pure face turned upward and her honest eyes

on his, that suspicion couldn't last.
"It would make the difference—"
If he paused again, it was only because his throat swelled with

a choking sensation that made it difficult to speak; he felt, too,

that his face was congested. Nevertheless the space, which was not

longer than a few seconds by the clock, gave him time to remember

that as his mother's and his sisters' incomes were inalienable he

was by so much the more free. He was by so much the more free to do

the mad, romantic, quixotic thing, which might seem to be a

contradiction of his past, but was not so much a contradiction of

himself as people who knew him imperfectly might suppose.

He was taken to be ambitious, calculating, shrewd; when all the

while he knew himself to be—as most Englishmen are at

heart—quixotic, romantic, and even a little mad, when madness

can be sublime.
He was able at last to get his sentence out.
"It would make the difference that ... before we are married ...

or after ... probably after ... I should have to square him."
"Square him?" She echoed the words as though she had no idea

what they meant.
"I'm worth ... I must be worth ... a hundred thousand

pounds ... perhaps more."
"Oh, you mean, square him in that way."
"I must be a man of honor before everything, by Jove!"
"You couldn't be anything else. You don't need to go to extremes

like that to prove it."
Her lack of emotion, of glad enthusiasm, chilled him. She even

ceased to look at him, turning her profile toward him and gazing

again abstractedly across the lawn. A sudden fear took hold of him,

the fear that his hesitations, his evident difficulty in getting

the thing out, had enabled her to follow the processes by which he

whipped himself up to an act that should have been spontaneous. He

had a suspicion, too, that in this respect he had fallen short of

the American—the cowboy, as he had called him. "I must do

better than him," he said, in his English idiom. The thought that

he might not have done as well was rather sickening. If he had so

failed it was through inadvertence, but the effect on Olivia would

be as great as if it was from fear. To counteract it he felt the

need of being more emphatic. His emphasis took the form of simple

common sense.
"It isn't going to extremes to take up one's own

responsibilities. I can't let a fellow like that do things for your

father any more than for mine, by Jove! It's not only doing things

for my father, but for—my wife."
Drawing up a small chair, he sat down on the other side of the

table. He sat down with the air of a man who means to stay and take

possession.
"Oh, but I'm not your wife, Rupert."
"You're my wife already," he declared, "to all intents and

purposes. We've published our intention to become man and wife to

the world. Neither of us can go back on that. The mere fact that

certain words haven't been mumbled over us is secondary. For

everything that constitutes duty I'm your husband now."
"Oh no, you're not. You're the noblest man in the world, Rupert.

I never dreamed that there could be any one like you. But I

couldn't let you—I couldn't—"
He crushed her hands in both of his own, leaning toward her

across the table. "Oh, my darling, if you only knew how easy it

is—"
"No, it isn't easy. It can't be easy. I couldn't let you do it

for me—"
"But what about him? You let—him!"
"Oh, but that's different."
"How is it different?"
"I don't know, Rupert; but it is. Or rather," she went on,

rapidly, "I do know, but I can't explain. If you were an American

you'd understand it."
"Oh, American—be blowed!" The accent was all tenderness,

the protest all beseeching.
"I can't explain it," she hurried on, "because you don't

understand us. It's one of the ways in which an Englishman never

can understand us. But the truth is that money doesn't

mean as much to us as it does to you. I know you think the

contrary, but that's where you make your primary mistake. It's

light come and light go with most of us, for the simple reason that

money is outside our real life; whereas with you English it's the

warp and woof of it."
"Oh, bosh, darling!"
"No, it isn't bosh. In your civilization it's as the blood; in

ours it's only as the clothing. That's something like the

difference. In accepting it from Peter Davenant—which is hard

enough!—I take only what he can do without;

whereas—"
"I can do without it, too."
"Whereas," she persisted, "if I were to let you do this I should

be robbing you of the essence of what you are."
He drew back slightly. "You mean that your Yankee is a strong

man, while I'm—"
"I don't mean anything invidious or unkind. But isn't it

self-evident, or nearly, that we're individuals, while you're parts

of an intricate social system? The minute you fall out of your

place in the system you come to grief; but vicissitudes don't

affect us much more than a change of coats."
"I don't care a button for my place in the system."
"But I do. I care for it for you. I should have married

you and shared it if I could. But I'd rather not marry you than

that you should lose it."
"That is," he said, coldly, "you'd rather use his money

than—"
She withdrew her hands, her brows contracting and her eyes

clouding in her effort to make him understand the position from her

point of view. "You see, it's this way. For one thing, we've taken

the money already. That's past. We may have taken it temporarily,

or for good and all, as things turn out; but in any case it's done.

And yet even if it weren't done it would be easier for us to draw

on him rather than on you, because he's one of ourselves."
"One of yourselves? I thought that's just what he wasn't. I

thought he was a jolly outsider."
"You mean socially. But that again hasn't much significance in a

country where socially we're all of one class. Where there's only

one class there can't be any outsiders."
"Oh, that's all very fine. But look at you with your extremes of

rich and poor!"
"That's the most superficial difference among us. It's the

easiest possible thing to transcend. I'm transcending it now in

feeling that I've a right—yes, a kind of right—to take

Peter Davenant's money, because as Americans we've a claim on each

other."
He threw himself against the straight back of the chair, his

arms flung out with a gesture that brought his hands nearly to the

floor. "You're the last people in the world to feel anything of the

kind. Every one knows that you're a set of ruthless,

predatory—"
"I know that's the way it seems; and I'm not defending anything

that may be wrong. And yet, in spite of all appearances to the

contrary, we have a sense of brotherhood—I don't

know any other name for it—among ourselves which isn't to be

found anywhere else in the world. You English haven't got it.

That's why the thing I'm saying seems mere sentiment to you, and

even mawkish. You're so afraid of sentiment. But it's true. It may

be only a rudimentary sense of brotherhood; and it's certainly not

universal, as it ought to be, because we feel it only among

ourselves. We don't really include the foreigner—not at least

till he becomes one of us. I'm an instance of that limitation

myself, because I can't feel it toward you, and I do—"
"You do feel it toward the big chap," he said, scornfully.
She made a renewed effort to explain herself. "You see, it's

something like this. If my aunt de Melcourt, who's very well off,

were to come forward and help us, I'd let her do it without

scruple. Not that there's any particular reason why she should! But

if she did—well, you can see for yourself that it wouldn't be

as if she were a stranger."
"Of course! She's one of your own people—and all

that."
"Well, he's one of our own people—Mr. Davenant. Not to the

degree that she is—but the same sort of thing—even if

more distant. It's very distant, I admit—"
His lip curled. "So distant as to be out of sight."
"No; not for him—or for me."
He sprang to his feet. "Look here, Olivia," he cried, nervously,

holding his chair by the back, "what does it all mean? What are you

leading up to?"
"I'm telling you as plainly as I can."
"What you aren't telling me as plainly as you can is which of us

you're in love with."
She colored. It was one of those blushes that spread up the

temples and over the brows and along the line of the hair with the

splendor of a stormy dawn.
"I didn't know the question had been raised," she said, "but

since apparently it has—"
It might have been contrition for a foolish speech, or fear of

what she was going to say, that prompted him to interrupt her

hurriedly:
"I beg your pardon. It was idiotic of me to say that. I didn't

mean it. As a matter of fact, I'm jumpy. I'm not master of myself.

So much has been happening—"
He came round the table, and, snatching one of her hands, he

kissed it again and again. He even sank on one knee beside her,

holding her close to him. With the hand that remained free she

stroked his crisp, wavy, iron-gray hair as a sign of pardon.
"You're quite wrong about me," he persisted.
"Even if you're right about other Englishmen—which I don't

admit—you're wrong about me, by Jove! If I had to give up

everything I had in the world I should have all the compensation a

man could desire if I got you."
She leaned over him, pressing his head against her breast, as

she whispered:
"You couldn't get me that way. You must understand—I must

make it as plain to you as I can—that I couldn't go to you

except as an equal. I couldn't go to any man—"
He sprang to his feet. "But you came to me as an

equal," he cried, in tones of exasperation. "That's all over and

done with. It's too late to reconsider the step we've

taken—too late for me—much too late!—and equally

too late for you."
"I can't admit that, Rupert. I've still the right to draw

back."
"The legal right—yes; whether or not you've the moral

right would depend on your sense of honor."
"Of honor?"
"Certainly. There's an honor for you as well as for me. When I'm

so true to you it wouldn't be the square thing to play me

false."
She rose without haste. "Do you call that a fair way of putting

it—to say that I play you false because I refuse to involve

you in our family disasters? I don't think any one could blame me

for that."
"What they could blame you for is this—for backing out of

what is practically a marriage, and for deserting me in a way that

will make it seem as if I had deserted you. Quite apart from the

fact that life won't be worth anything to me without you, it will

mean ruin as a man of honor if I go home alone. Every one will

say—every one—that I funked the thing because

your father—"
She hastened to speak. "That's a very urgent reason. I admit its

force—"
She paused because there was a sound of voices overhead.

Footsteps came along the upper hall and began to descend the

stairs. Presently Davenant could be heard saying:
"Then I shall tell Harrington that they may as well foreclose at

one time as another."
"Just as well." Guion's reply came from the direction of his

bedroom door. "I see nothing to be gained by waiting. The sooner

it's over the sooner to sleep, what?"
"They're talking about the mortgage on the property," she

explained, as Davenant continued to descend. "This house is to be

sold—and everything in it—"
"Which is one more reason why we should be married without

delay. I say," he added, in another tone, "let's have him in."
"Oh no! What for?"
Before she could object further, Ashley had slipped out into the

hall.
"I say! Come along in."
His attitude as he stood with hands thrust into his jacket

pockets and shoulders squared bespoke conscious superiority to the

man whom he was addressing. Though Davenant was not in her line of

vision she could divine his astonishment at this easy, English

unceremoniousness, as well as his resentment to the tone of

command. She heard him muttering an excuse which Ashley interrupted

with his offhand "Oh, come in. Miss Guion would like to see

you."
She felt it her duty to go forward and second this invitation.

Davenant, who was standing at the foot of the staircase, murmured

something about town and business.
"It's too late for town and business at this hour," Ashley

objected. "Come in."
He withdrew toward the room where Olivia was standing between

the portières of the doorway. Davenant yielded, partly

because of his ignorance of the small arts of graceful refusal, but

more because of his curiosity concerning the man Olivia Guion was

to marry. He had some interest, too, in observing one who was

chosen where he himself had been rejected. It would afford an

answer to the question, "What lack I yet?" with which he was

tormented at all times. That it could not be a flattering answer

was plain to him from the careless, indefinable graces of Ashley's

style. It was a style that Davenant would have scorned to imitate,

but which nevertheless he envied. In contrast with its unstudied

ease he could feel his own social methods to be labored and

apologetic. Where he was watchful to do the right thing, what

Ashley said or did became the right thing because he said or did

it. With the echo of soft English vowels and clear, crisp

consonants in his ears, his own pronunciations, too, were rough

with the harshness transmitted from an ancestry to whom the melody

of speech had been of no more practical concern than the music of

the spheres.
Something of all this Olivia guessed. She guessed it with a

feeling of being on his side—on the American side—which

a month ago would have astonished her. She guessed, too, on

Davenant's part, that feeling of irritation which the calm

assumptions of the Old World are likely to create when in contact

with the aggressive unpretentiousness of the New, and if need were

she was ready to stand by him. All she could say, however, for the

moment was:
"Won't you sit down? Perhaps I ought to ring for tea."
She made the latter remark from habit. It was what she was

accustomed to think of when on an autumn day the sun went behind

the distant rim of Brookline hills and dusk began to gather in the

oval room, as it was gathering now. If she did not ring, it was

because of her sense of the irony of offering hospitality in a

house where not even a cup of tea was paid for.
She seated herself beside the round table in the chair she had

occupied a half-hour earlier, facing inward to the room instead of

outward to the portico. Ashley backed to the curving wall of the

room, while Davenant scarcely advanced beyond the doorway. In his

slow, careful approach the latter reminded her somewhat of a big

St. Bernard dog responding to the summons of a leopard.
"Been up to see—?" Ashley nodded in the direction of what

he took to be Guion's room.
Davenant, too, nodded, but said nothing.
"How did you find papa to-day?"
"Pretty fair, Miss Guion; only, perhaps, a little more down on

his luck than usual."
"The excitement kept him up at first. Now that that's

over—"
Ashley interrupted her, addressing himself to Davenant. "I

understand that it's to you we owe Mr. Guion's relief from the most

pressing part of his cares."
Davenant's face clouded. It was the thing he was afraid

of—Ashley's intrusion into the little domain of helpfulness

which for a few days he had made his own. He answered warily:
"My business with Mr. Guion, Colonel, has been private. I hope

you won't mind if we leave it so."
Ashley's manner took on the diplomatic persuasiveness he used

toward restive barbaric potentates.
"Not a bit, my dear fellow. Of course it's private—only

not as regards Miss Guion and me. You simply must allow us

to say how grateful we are for your help, even though it need be no

more than temporary."
The word produced its effect. Davenant looked from Ashley to

Olivia while he echoed it. "Temporary?"
Ashley nodded again. "You have no objection, I presume, to

that?"
"If Mr. Guion is ever in a position to pay me back," Davenant

said, slowly, in some bewilderment, "of course I'll take it."
"Quite so; and I think I may say that with a little

time—let us say a year—we shall be able to

meet—"
"It's a good bit of money," Davenant warned him.
"I know that; but if you'll give us a little leeway—as I

know you will—"
"He means," Olivia spoke up, "that he'll sell his

property—and whatever else he has—and pay you."
"I don't want that," Davenant said, hastily.
"But I do. It's a point of honor with me not to let another man

shoulder—"
"And it's a point of honor with me, Rupert—"
"To stand by me," he broke in, quickly.
"I can't see it that way. What you propose is entirely against

my judgment. It's fantastic; it's unreal. I want you to understand

that if you attempted to carry it out I shouldn't marry you.

Whatever the consequences either to you or to me—I

shouldn't marry you."
"And if I didn't attempt it? Would you marry me then?"
She looked up, then down, then at Davenant, then away from him.

Finally she fixed her gaze on Ashley.
"Yes," she said at last. "If you'll promise to let this wild

project drop, I'll marry you whenever you like. I'll waive all the

other difficulties—"
Davenant came forward, his hand outstretched. "I think I must

say good-by now, Miss Guion—"
"No; wait," Ashley commanded. "This matter concerns you, by

Jove!"
Olivia sprang to her feet. "No; it doesn't, Rupert," she said,

hastily.
"No; it doesn't," Davenant repeated after her. "It's not my

affair. I decline to be brought into it. I think I must say good-by

now, Miss Guion—"
"Listen, will you!" Ashley said, impatiently. "I'm not going to

say anything either of you need be afraid of. I'm only asking you

to do me the justice of trying to see things from my point of view.

You may think it forced or artificial or anything you please; but

unfortunately, as an officer and a gentleman, I've got to take it.

The position you'd put me in would be this—of playing a

game—and a jolly important game at that—in which the

loser loses to me on purpose."
Ashley found much satisfaction in this way of putting it.

Without exposing him to the necessity of giving details, it made

clear his perception of what was going on. Moreover, it secured him

le beau rôle, which for a few minutes he feared he

might have compromised. In the look he caught, as it flashed

between Olivia and Davenant, he saw the signs of that appreciation

he found it so hard to do without—the appreciation of Rupert

Ashley as the chivalrous Christian gentleman, at once punctilious

and daring, who would count all things as loss in order to achieve

the highest type of manhood. If in the back of his mind he had the

conviction, hardly venturing to make itself a thought, "In the long

run it pays," it was but little to his discredit, since he could

scarcely have descended from a line of shrewd, far-sighted

Anglo-Saxon forefathers without making some such computation.
"If we're going to play a game," he continued, addressing

Davenant, before the latter had time to speak, "for Heaven's sake

let us play it straight—like men. Let the winner win and the

loser lose—"
"I've no objection to that, Colonel, when I do

play—but at present—"
"Look here," Ashley said, with a new inspiration; "I put it to

you—I put it to you as a man—simply as a

man—without any highfalutin principles whatever.

Suppose I'd done what you've done—and given my bottom

dollar—"
"But I haven't."
"Well, no matter! Suppose I had done what you've done—and

you were in my place—would you, as a man—simply as a

man, mind you—be willing to go off with the lady

whom I had freed from great anxiety—to say the

least—and be happy forever after—and so

forth—with nothing but a Thank-you-sir? Come now! Would

you?"
It was evident that Davenant was shy of accepting this

challenge. He colored and looked uneasy—all the more so

because Olivia lifted her eyes to him appealingly, as though

begging him to come to her support. It was perhaps in the belief

that he would do so that she said, earnestly, leaning forward a

little:
"Tell him, Mr. Davenant, tell him."
"I don't see what it's got to do with me—" Davenant began

to protest.
"It's got everything to do with you," Ashley broke in. "Since

you've created the situation you can't shirk its

responsibilities."
"Tell him, Mr. Davenant, tell him," Olivia repeated. "Would you,

or would you not?"
He looked helplessly from one to the other. "Well, then—I

wouldn't," he said, simply.
"There you are!" Ashley cried, triumphantly, moving away from

the wall and turning toward Olivia.
She was plainly disappointed. Davenant could so easily have

said, "I would." Nevertheless, she answered quietly, picking up the

paper-knife that lay on the table and turning it this way and that

as though studying the tints of the mother-of-pearl in the dying

light:
"It doesn't matter to me, Rupert, what other people would do or

would not do. If you persist in this attempt—this mad

attempt—I shall not marry you."
He strode to the table, looking down at her averted face and

bent head.
"Then we're at a deadlock."
She gave him a quick glance. "No; it isn't a deadlock,

because—because there's still a way out."
He leaned above her, supporting himself with his hand on the

table. "And it's a way I shall never take so long as you can't

say—what you admitted a little while ago that you couldn't

say—"
"I can't say it," she murmured, her face still further averted;

"but all the same it's cruel of you to make it a condition."
He bent lower till his lips almost touched her hair. "It's cruel

of you," he whispered, "to put me in the position where I

must."
The room and the hall behind it were now so dim that Davenant

had no difficulty in slipping between the portières and

getting away.

XVII
"H
e's going to squeeze me out."
This was Davenant's reflection as he walked back, along the

Embankment, to Rodney Temple's house. He made it bitterly, in the

light of clarified views, as to the ethics of giving and taking

benefits. Up to within the last few days the subject had seemed to

him a relatively simple one. If you had money, and wished to give

it away, you gave it. If you needed it, and were so lucky as to

have it offered you, you took it. That was all. That such natural

proceedings should create complicated relations and searchings of

heart never entered his mind.
He could see that they might, however, now that the knowledge

was forced upon him. Enlightenment came by the easy process of

putting himself in Ashley's place. "I wouldn't take my wife as a

kind of free gift from another fellow—I'll be hanged if I

would! I'd marry her on my own or not at all."
And unless Ashley assumed the responsibilities of his future

wife's position, he couldn't marry her "on his own." That much was

clear. It was also the most proper thing in the world. It was a

right—a privilege. He looked upon it chiefly as a privilege.

Ashley would sell his estate, and, having paid him, Davenant, the

money he had advanced, would send him about his business. There

would be nothing left for him but to disappear. The minute there

was no need for him there would be no place for him. He had been no

more than the man who holds a horse till the owner comes and rides

away.
Worse than that reflection was the fear that his intervention

had been uncalled for in the first place. The belief that it was

imperative had been his sole excuse for forcing himself on people

who fought against his aid and professed themselves able to get

along without it. But the event seemed to show that if he had let

things alone, Rupert Ashley would have come and taken the burden on

himself. As he was apparently able to shoulder it, it would have

been better to let him do it. In that case he, Peter Davenant,

would not have found himself in a position from which he could not

withdraw, while it was a humiliation to be dislodged from it.
But, on the other hand, he would have missed his most wonderful

experience. There was that side to it, too. He would not have had

these moments face to face with Olivia Guion which were to be as

food for his sustenance all the rest of his life. During these days

of discussion, of argument, of conflict between his will and hers,

he had the entirely conscious sense that he was laying up the

treasure on which his heart would live as long as it continued to

beat. The fact that she found intercourse with him more or less

distasteful became a secondary matter. To be in her presence was

the thing essential, whatever the grounds on which he was admitted

there. In this way he could store up her looks, her words, her

gestures, against the time when the memory of them would be all he

should have. As for her proposals of friendship made to him that

day—her suggestions of visits to be paid to Ashley and

herself, with introductions to a greater world—he swept them

aside. He quite understood that she was offering him the two mites

that make a farthing out of the penury of her resources, and, while

he was touched by the attempt to pay him, he didn't want them.
He had said, and said again, that he didn't want anything at

all. Neither did he. It would have been enough for him to go on as

he was going now—to fetch and carry, to meet lawyers and

pacify creditors, to protect her father because he was her

father, and get a glimpse of her or a word from her when he came on

his errands to Tory Hill. There were analogies between his devotion

and the adoration of a mortal for a goddess beyond the stars. Like

Hippolytus, he would have been content that his Artemis should

never step down from her shrine so long as he was permitted to lay

his gifts on her altar.
At least, he had felt so till to-day. He had begun the adventure

in the strength of the desire born of his visit to the scene of his

father's work at Hankow to do a little good. True, it was an

impulse of which he was more than half ashamed. Its mere

formulation in words rendered it bumptious and presumptuous. Beyond

the confession made to Rodney Temple on the night of his arrival no

force could have induced him to avow it. Better any imputation of

craft than the suspicion of wanting to confer benefits on his

fellow-men. It was a satisfaction to him to be able to say, even in

his own inner consciousness, that the desperate state of Guion's

affairs forced his hand and compelled him to a quixotic course

which he would not otherwise have taken.
The first glimpse of Ashley brought this verbal shelter to the

dust. So long as the accepted lover had been but an abstract

conception Davenant had been able to think of him with toleration.

But in presence of the actual man the feeling of antagonism was

instinctive, animal, instantaneous. Though he pumped up his phrases

of welcome to a heartiness he did not feel, he was already saying

to himself that his brief day of romance was done. "He's going to

squeeze me out." With this alert and capable soldier on the spot,

there would be no need for a clumsy interloper any longer. They

could do without him, and would be glad to see him go.
The upshot of it all was that he must retire. It was not only

the part of tact, but a gentleman could do no less. Ashley had all

the rights and powers. The effort to withstand him would be worse

than ineffectual, it would be graceless. In Miss Guion's eyes it

would be a blunder even more unpardonable than that for which her

punishment had been in some ways the ruling factor in his life. He

was sure she would not so punish him again, but her disdain would

not be needed. Merely to be de trop in her sight, merely

to be troublesome, would be a chastisement from which he should

suffer all the stings of shame. If he was to go on serving her with

the disinterestedness of which, to himself at any rate, he had made

a boast, if he was to keep the kindly feeling she had perhaps begun

to entertain for him, he must resign his provisional authority into

Ashley's hands and efface himself.
To do that would be easy. He had only to advance by a few weeks

his departure for Stoughton, Michigan, where he meant to return in

any case. It was the familiar field of those opportunities in

copper which he hoped to profit by again. Once he was on that

ground, Olivia Guion and her concerns would be as much a part of a

magic past as the woods and mountains of a holiday are to a man

nailed down at an office desk. With a very little explanation to

Ashley he could turn his back on the whole business and give

himself up to his own affairs.
He made an effort to recapture his zest in the old game, but

after the passionate interest he had put into the past week the fun

was out of it. Stoughton, Michigan, presented itself as a

ramshackled, filthy wooden town of bar-rooms, eating-rooms,

pool-rooms, and unspeakable hotels. The joys and excitements he had

known over such deals as the buying and selling of the Catapult,

the Peppermint, and the Etna mines were as flat now as the lees of

yesternight's feast. "I'm not in love with her," he kept saying,

doggedly, to himself; and yet the thought of leaving Olivia Guion

and her interests to this intrusive stranger, merely because he was

supposed to have a prior claim, was sickening. It was more

sickening still that the Englishman should not only be disposed to

take up all the responsibilities Davenant would be laying down, but

seemed competent to do it.
On the embankment he met Rodney Temple, taking the air after his

day in the Gallery of Fine Arts. He walked slowly, with a stoop,

his hands behind him. Now and then he paused to enjoy the last

tints of pink and purple and dusky saffron mirrored in the reaches

of the river or to watch the swing of some college crew and the

swan-like movement of their long, frail shell.
"Hello! Where are you off to? Home?"
Davenant had not yet raised this question with himself, but now

that it was before him he saw it was worth considering. Home, for

the present, meant Drusilla and Mrs. Temple, with their intuitions

and speculations, their hints and sympathies. He scarcely knew

which he dreaded most, the old lady's inquisitive tenderness or

Drusilla's unsparing perspicacity.
"Not home just yet, sir," he had the wit to say. "In fact, I'm

walking in to Boston, and may not be home to dinner. Perhaps you'll

tell Mrs. Temple so when you go in. Then I sha'n't have to 'phone

her."
Temple let that pass. "Been up to look at the great man?"
Peter nodded. "Just come from there."
"And what do you make of him?"
"Oh, he's a decent sort."
"Not going to back out, eh?"
"Not at all; just the other way: he wants to step in and take

everything off—off our hands."
"You don't say so. Then he's what you say—a decent

sort."
"He's more than that," Davenant heard himself saying, to his own

surprise. "He's a fine specimen of his type, and the type

itself—"
"Is superb," the old man concluded. "That's about what I

supposed he'd be. You could hardly imagine Olivia Guion picking out

any other kind—especially as it's a kind that's as thick as

blackberries in their army."
Davenant corroborated this by a brief account of what Ashley

proposed to do. Light gleamed in the old man's eyes and a smile

broke the shaggy crevice between his beard and mustache as he

listened.
"Splendid! Splendid!" he commented, now at one point and now at

another of the information Peter was imparting. "Sell his estate

and pay up? That's downright sporting, isn't it?"
"Oh, he's sporting enough."
"And what a grand thing for you to get your money back. I

thought you would some day—if Vic de Melcourt ever came to

hear of what you'd done; but I didn't expect it so soon."
Davenant turned away. "I wasn't in a hurry."
"No; but he is. That's the point. That's where the beauty of it

comes in for Olivia and you."
Peter looked blank. "Olivia and—me?"
"He's doing right," the old man explained, taking hold of the

lapel of Davenant's coat, "or what he conceives to be right; and no

one man can do that without putting us into a better position all

round. Doing right," he continued, emphasizing his words by shaking

the lapel and hammering on Peter's breast—"doing right is the

solution of all the difficulties into which we get ourselves tied

up by shilly-shallying and doing wrong. If Ashley were to hang fire

you wouldn't know where the devil you were. But now that he's going

straight, it leaves you free to do the same."
"It leaves me free to cut and run." He made little effort to

conceal his bitterness.
"Then cut and run, if that's what you feel impelled to do. You

won't run far before you see you're running to a purpose. I'll cut

and run, too," he added, cheerfully. "I'll be off to see Olivia,

and tell her she's made a catch."
Davenant was glad to be able to resume his tramp. "Poor old

chap," he said to himself; "a lot he knows about it! It's damned

easy to do right when you've got everything your own way."
Having everything his own way was the happy position in which he

placed Rupert Ashley, seeing he was able to marry Olivia Guion by

the simple process of selling an estate. There was no more to that

in Davenant's estimation than to his own light parting with his

stocks and bonds. Whatever sacrifice the act might entail would

have ample compensation, since the giving up of the temporal and

non-essential would secure supreme and everlasting bliss. He would

gladly have spared a hand or an eye for a mere chance at the same

reward.
Arrived in Boston there was nothing for him to do but to eat an

expensive dinner at a restaurant and go back again. He did not

return on foot. He had had enough of his own thoughts. They led him

round and round in a circle without end. He was ashamed, too, to

perceive that they concerned themselves chiefly, not with his love

for Olivia Guion, but with his enmity to Rupert Ashley. It was the

first time in his life that he was ever possessed by the fury to

kill a man. He wouldn't have been satisfied to be rid of Ashley; he

wanted to leap on him, to strike him, to choke him, to beat him to

death. Sitting with his eyes fixed on the table-cloth, from which

the waiter had removed everything but the finger-bowl and the bill,

and allowing the cigar that protruded between his knuckles to burn

uselessly, he had already indulged in these imaginary exercises,

not a little to his relief, before he shook himself and muttered:

"I'm a damned fool."
The repetition of this statement, together with the dull belief

that repetition engenders, braced him at last to paying his bill

and taking the tram-car to Waverton. He had formed a resolution. It

was still early, scarcely later than the hour at which he usually

dined. He had a long evening before him. He would put it to use by

packing his belongings. Then he would disappear. He might go at

once to Stoughton, or he might travel no farther than the rooms he

had engaged, and which he had occupied in former years, on the less

attractive slope of Beacon Hill. It would be all the same. He would

be out of the circle of interests that centered round Olivia Guion,

and so free to come back to his senses.
He got so much elation out of this resolve that from the

electric car to Rodney Temple's house he walked with a swinging

stride, whistling tunelessly beneath his breath. He tried to think

he was delivered from an extraordinary obsession and restored to

health and sanity. He planned to initiate Ashley as the new

chargé d'affaires without the necessity on his part

of seeing Miss Guion again.
And yet, when he opened the door with his latch-key and saw a

note lying on the table in the hail, his heart bounded as though it

meant to stop beating. It was sheer premonition that made him think

the letter was for him. He stooped and read the address before he

had taken off his hat and while he was still tugging at his

gloves:
Peter Davenant, Esq.,

31 Charlesbank.
It was premonition again that told him the contents before he

had read a line:

Dear Mr. Davenant,—If you are

quite free this evening, could you look in on me again? Don't come

unless you have really nothing else to do. Yours sincerely,
Olivia Guion.

He looked at his watch. It was only half-past eight. "I've no

excuse for not going," he said to himself. He made it clear to his

heart that he regretted the necessity. After the brave decisions to

which he had come, decisions which he might have put into

execution, it was a call backward, a retrogression. He began

already to be afraid that he might not be so resolute a second

time. But he had no excuse for not going. That fact took the matter

out of his hands. There was nothing to do but to crumple the letter

into his pocket, take down his evening overcoat from its peg, and

leave the house before any one knew he had entered.
The night was mild. It was so soft and scented that it might

have been in June. From the stars and the street-lamps and the line

of electrics along the water's edge there was just light enough to

show the surface of the river, dim and metallic, and the wisps of

vapor hovering above the marshes. In the east, toward Cambridge and

beyond Boston, the sky was bright with the simulation of the dawn

that precedes the moonrise.
His heart was curiously heavy. If he walked rapidly it was none

the less reluctantly. For the first time since he had taken part

and lot in the matter in hand he had no confidence in himself. He

had ceased to be able to say, "I'm not in love with her," while he

had no other strengthening formula to put in its place.
Algonquin Avenue, which older residents still called Rodney

Lane, was as still and deserted as a country road. The entry gate

to Tory Hill clicked behind him with curious, lonely loudness. The

gravel crunched in the same way beneath his tread. Looking up at

the house, he saw neither light nor sign of living. There was

something stricken and sinister about the place.
He was half-way toward the front door when a white figure came

forward beneath the Corinthian portico. If it had not been so white

he couldn't have seen it.
"I'm here, Mr. Davenant."
The voice, too, sounded lonely, like a voice in a vast, empty

house. He crossed the lawn to the portico. Olivia had already

reseated herself in the wicker chair from which she had risen at

his approach.
"Aren't you afraid of taking cold?" She had not offered him her

hand; both hands were hidden in the folds of her voluminous wrap.

He said the simplest thing he could think of.
"No. I'm wearing a very warm fur-lined cloak. It's very long,

too. I couldn't stay indoors. The house seemed so—so

dead."
"Is there nobody with you?"
"Colonel Ashley went back to town before dinner. Papa wasn't

quite so well. He's trying to sleep. Will you sit down on the step,

or go in and bring out a chair? But perhaps you'll find it chilly.

If so, we'll go in."
She half rose, but he checked her. "Not at all. I like it here.

It's one of our wonderful, old-fashioned Octobers, isn't it?

Besides, I've got an overcoat."
He threw the coat over his shoulders, seating himself on the

floor, with his feet on the steps below him and his back to one of

the fluted Corinthian pilasters. The shadow was so deep on this

side of the house—the side remote from the approaching

moonrise—that they could see each other but dimly. Of the two

she was the more visible, not only because she was in white, but

because of the light coming through the open sitting-room behind

her from the hail in the middle of the house. In this faint glimmer

he could see the pose of her figure in the deep wicker arm-chair

and the set of her neat head with its heavy coil of hair.
"I asked you to come," she said, simply, "because I feel so

helpless."
"That's a very good reason," he responded, guardedly. "I'm glad

you thought of me, rather than of any one else."
He was pleased to note that even to his own ears his accent was

polite, but no more. At the same minute he found the useful formula

he had been in search of—"I mustn't let her know I'm in love

with her."
"There's no one else for me to think of," she explained, in

self-excuse. "If there were, I shouldn't bother you."
"That's not so kind," he said, keeping to the tone of

conventional gallantry.
"I don't mean that I haven't plenty of friends. I know lots of

people—naturally; but I don't know them in a way to appeal to

them like this."
"Then so much the better for me."
"That's not a reason for my imposing on your kindness; and yet

I'm afraid I must go on doing it. I feel like a person in such

desperate straits for ready money that he's reckless of the rate of

interest. Not that it's a question of money now—exactly."
"It doesn't matter what it's a case of. I'm at your service,

Miss Guion—"
"I know. That's why I asked you to come. I want you to keep

Colonel Ashley from doing what he proposed this afternoon."
She spoke more abruptly, more nervously, than was her habit.
"I would if I could; but I don't know that I've any way of

dissuading him."
"You needn't dissuade him. You've simply to refuse to take his

money."
"It's not quite so easy as that, because there's no direct

business between him and me. If Mr. Guion wanted to pay me what

I've lent him, I couldn't decline to accept it. Do you see?"
In the dim light he noticed her head nodding slowly. "Oh, so

that's the way it is? It would have to be done through papa?"
"It would have to be done through him. And if he preferred to

use Colonel Ashley's money rather than mine, I should have nothing

at all to say."
"I see; I see," she commented, thoughtfully. "And I don't know

how papa would feel about it, or how far I could count on him."
For a few minutes Davenant said nothing. When he spoke it was

with some amazement at his own temerity. "I thought you didn't want

my help, if you could possibly get any other?"
The words took her by surprise. He could see her draw her cloak

more tightly about her, her hands still within its folds.
"I felt that way at first. I don't now. Perhaps I understand you

a little better. But, in any case, I couldn't take his."
He pushed the liberty a little further. "But if you're going to

marry him—"
"That's just it. I wonder if you've the faintest idea of what it

means to a woman to marry a man by making herself a burden to him

in advance—and such a burden!"
"It wouldn't be a burden to any one who—who—"
"I know what you're going to say. Love does make a difference.

Of course. But it acts one way on the man and another way on the

woman. In proportion as it urges him to make the sacrifice, it

impels her to prevent it."
He grew still bolder. The cover of the night and the intimacy of

the situation made him venturesome. "Then why don't you break off

your engagement?"
It was a long while before she answered. "He won't let me," she

said then. "And, besides," she added, after slight hesitation,

"it's difficult not to be true to a man who's showing himself so

noble."
"Is that your only reason?"
She raised her head slightly and turned toward him. He expected

something cutting, but she only said: "What makes you ask

that?"
He was a little frightened. He backed down, and yet not

altogether. "Oh, nothing. I only—wondered."
"If you think I don't care for him—"
"Oh no. Not that—not that at all."
"Well, if you were to think it, it would probably be

because I've been through so much—I'm going through

so much—that that sort of thing has become secondary."
"I didn't know that—that sort of thing—was ever

secondary."
"Because you've never had the experience. If you had—"
The freedom of speech she seemed to be according him led him on

to say:
"I've had experience enough—as you may know—to be

sure it wouldn't be secondary with me."
She seemed willing to discuss the point. "When I say secondary I

mean that I'm in a position in which I find it isn't the most

important thing in the world to me to marry the man I—I care

for."
"Then, what is the most important thing?"
She stirred impatiently. "Oh, it's no use going into that; I

suppose it would be—to be free—not to owe you

anything—or anybody anything—to be out of this big,

useless house—away from these unpaid

servants—and—and free! I'm not a dependent person. I

dare say you've noticed that. I shouldn't mind having no money. I

know a way by which I could support myself—and papa. I've

thought that out. I shouldn't mind being alone in the world,

either—if I could only burst the coil that's been wound about

me."
"But since you can't," he said, rather cruelly, "wouldn't the

next best thing be—to marry the man you care for?"
Her response was to say, irrelevantly, somewhat quaveringly, in

a voice as near to tears as he could fancy her coming: "I wish I

hadn't fallen out with Aunt Vic."
"Why? Would she help you?"
"She's very good and kind—in her way."
"Why don't you write to her?"
"Writing wouldn't be any good now. It's too late."
Another long silence fell between them. The darkened windows of

the house on the other side of the lawn began to reflect a pallid

gleam as the moon rose. Shadows of trees and of clumps of shrubbery

became faintly visible on the grass. The great rounded elm in the

foreground detached itself against the shimmering, illuminated sky

like an open fan. Davenant found something ecstatic in the

half-light, the peace, and the extraordinary privilege of being

alone with her. It would be one more memory to treasure up.

Silence, too, was a form of communion more satisfactory to him than

speech. It was so full of unutterable things that he wondered at

her allowing it to last.
Nevertheless, it was he who broke it. The evening grew chilly at

last. Somewhere in the town a clock struck ten. He felt it would be

indiscreet to stay longer.
"I'll make a try for it, Miss Guion," he said, when he had got

on his feet to go away. "Since you want me to see Colonel Ashley, I

will."
"They always say that one man has such influence on another,"

she said, rising, too—"and you see things so clearly and have

such a lot of common sense.... I'll walk down to the gate with

you.... I'm tired with sitting still."
He offered his hand to help her in descending the portico steps.

Though there was no need for her to take it, she did so. The white

cloak, loosely gathered in one hand in front, trailed behind her.

He thought her very spirit-like and ethereal.
At the foot of the steps his heart gave a great bound; he went

hot and cold. It seemed to him—he was sure—he could

have sworn—that her hand rested in his a perceptible instant

longer than there was any need for.
A moment later he was scoffing at the miracle. It was a mistake

on his part, or an accident on hers. It was the mocking of his own

desire, the illusion of his feverish, overstrained senses. It was a

restorative to say to himself: "Don't be a damned fool."
And yet they walked to the gate almost in silence. It was a

silence without embarrassment, like that which had preceded it. It

had some of the qualities of the silence which goes with

long-established companionships. He spoke but once, to remind her,

protectingly, that the grass was damp, and to draw her—almost

tactually—to the graveled path.
They came to the gate, but he did not immediately say good

night.
"I wish you could throw the burden of the whole thing on me,

Miss Guion," he ventured, wistfully, "and just take it easy."
She looked away from him, over the sprinkling of lights that

showed the town. "If I could do it with any one, it would be with

you—now."
There was an inflection on the now which again gave him

strange and sudden thrills, as though some extraordinary chemical

agent had been infused into his blood. All kinds of capitulations

were implied in it—changes of heart and mind and

attitude—changes that had come about imperceptibly, and for

reasons which he, and perhaps she, could not have followed. He felt

the upleaping of great joy. It was joy so intense that it made him

tactful, temperate. It also made him want to rush away and be

alone.
"I'll make that do for the present," he said, smiling down at

her through the darkness. "Thank you for letting me come. Good

night."
"Good night."
There was again that barely noticeable lingering of her hand in

his. The repetition rather disappointed him. "It's just her way of

shaking hands," was the explanation he gave of it.
When he had passed out of the gate he pretended to take his way

down Algonquin Avenue, but he only crossed the Street to the

shelter of a friendly elm. There he could watch her tall, white

figure as it went slowly up the driveway. Except for a dim light in

the fan-shaped window over the front door the house was dark. The

white figure moved with an air of dragging itself along.
"It isn't the most important thing in the world for her," he

whispered to himself, "to marry—the man she cares

for."
There was a renewal of his blind fury against Ashley, while at

the same time he found himself groaning, inwardly: "I wish to God

the man she cares for wasn't such a—such a—trump!"

XVIII
W
hen the colonel of the Sussex Rangers woke on

the following morning the Umfraville element in him, fatigued

doubtless with the demands of the previous day, still slept on.

That strain in him which had made his maternal ancestors

gentlemen-adventurers in Tudor times, and cavaliers in the days of

Charles the First, and Jacobites with James the Second, and

roysterers with George the Fourth—loyal, swashbuckling, and

impractical, daring, dashing, lovable, absurd, bound to come to

grief one day or another, as they had come—that strain lying

dormant, Ashley was free to wake in the spirit of the manufacturer

of brushes. In other words he woke in alarm. It was very real

alarm. It was alarm not unlike that of the gambler who realizes in

the cold stare of morning that for a night's excitement he has

thrown away a fortune.
The feeling was so dreadful that, as he lay for a few minutes

with his eyes closed, he could say without exaggeration that he had

never felt anything so sickening in his life. It was worse than the

blue funk that attended the reveille for his first

battle—worse than the bluer remorse that had come with the

dawn after some of his more youthful sprees. The only parallel to

it he could find was in the desolation of poor creatures he had

seen, chiefly in India, reduced suddenly by fire, flood, or

earthquake to the skin they stood in and a lodging on the ground.

His swaggering promises of yesterday had brought him as near as

possible to that.
Fortunately, when he had sprung out of bed the feeling became

less poignant. By the time he had had his bath and his breakfast it

had got itself within the limits of what could be expressed in the

statement: "I've been a jolly ass."
Though there was no denying this fact, he could nevertheless use

the reproach in its precise signification. He was not a jolly ass

because he had remained true to Olivia Guion, but because of the

extravagant methods of his faithfulness. No one but an Umfraville,

he declared, would have hesitated to accept the status

quo. Considering that in spite of everything he was still

eager to give Olivia the shelter of his name and the advantages of

his position, his insistence on doing more fell short of the

grotesque.
Nevertheless he had insisted on it, and it was too late to

shrink from making good his offer. No doubt, if he did so shrink,

Olivia would commend him; but it would be a commendation not

inconsistent with a fall in her esteem. His nerves still tingled

with the joy of hearing her say, as she had said yesterday: "You're

the noblest man in the world; I never dreamed there could be any

one like you." She was so sparing with her words that these meant

more from her than from another. If she used them, it was because

she thought he was the noblest man in the world and

because he did surpass her dreams. This was setting up the

standard in a way that permitted no falling short of it. He must be

Rupert Ashley at his best even if the world went to pieces while he

made the attempt. Moreover, if he failed, there was always Peter

Davenant ready to loom up above him. "I must keep higher than him,"

he said to himself, "whatever it costs me." So, little by little,

the Umfraville in him also woke, with its daredevil chivalry. It

might be said to have urged him on, while the Ashley prudence held

him back, when from his room in the hotel he communicated by

telephone with Olivia, begging her to arrange an interview between

Guion and himself about eleven o'clock.

On taking the message to her father Olivia found him awake, but

still in bed. Since his downfall had become generally known, she

had noticed a reluctance on his part to get up. It was true he was

not well; but his shrinking from activity was beyond what his

degree of illness warranted. It was a day or two before she learned

to view this seeming indolence as nothing but the desire to creep,

for as many hours as possible out of the twenty-four, into the only

refuge left to him. In his bed he was comparatively safe, not from

the law, which he no longer had to fear, but from intrusion and

inspection, and, above all, from sympathy.
It was between nine and ten o'clock. The blinds were up, the

windows open, and the sunshine was streaming in. A tray with his

scarcely tasted breakfast on it stood beside the bed. Guion lay on

his back, his head sunk deep into the pillows. Though his face was

turned from the door and his eyes closed, Olivia knew he was not

sleeping. After performing small tasks in the room, carrying the

breakfast tray into the hall, and lowering the blinds, she sat down

at the bedside.
"Papa, darling."
As he turned his head slowly she thought his eyes had the look

of mortal ennui that Rembrandt depicts in those of Lazarus rising

from the tomb and coming back to life.
She delivered her message, to which he replied, "He can

come."
"I think I ought to tell you," she continued, "what he's coming

for."
She gave him the gist of her conversation with Ashley on the

previous day and the one great decision to which they had led him

up. It would have gratified Ashley, could he have overheard, to

note the skill with which she conveyed precisely that quality of

noble precipitancy in his words and resolutions which he himself

feared they had lacked. If a slight suspicion could have risen in

his mind, it would have been that of a certain haste on her part to

forestall any possible questioning of his eagerness such as he had

occasion to observe in himself. That might have wounded him.
"So he wants to go ahead," Guion said, when she had

finished.
"Apparently."
"Can't he do that and still leave things as they are?"
"He seems to think he can't."
"I don't see why. If I have to owe the money to any one, I'd

rather owe it to Davenant."
"So should I."
"Do you really want to marry him?"
The question startled her. "Marry him? Who?"
There was a look almost of humor in Guion's forlorn eyes. "Well,

I didn't mean Davenant. I didn't suppose there was any—"
"Papa, darling," she hastened to say, "as things are at present

I'd rather not marry any one at all. There's so much for me to do

in getting life on another footing for us both that marriage seems

to belong to another kind of world."
He raised himself on his elbow, turning toward her. "Then why

don't you tell him so?"
"I have; but he won't take that as a reason. And, besides, I've

said I would marry him if he'd give up this wild

project—"
"But you're in love with him, aren't you? You may as well tell

me," he continued, as she colored. "I must have some data

to go on."
"I—I was in love with him," she faltered. "I

suppose I am still. But while everything is as it is,

I—I—can't tell; I—I don't know. I'm—I'm

feeling so many other things that I don't know whether I

feel—feel love—or not. I dare say I do. But it's like

asking a man if he's fond of playing a certain game when he thinks

he's going to die."
He slipped down into bed again, pulling the coverlet about his

chin and turning his face away. As he said nothing more, she rose

to go. "About eleven, then, papa dear."
She could hear a muffled assent as she left the room. She was

afraid he was crying.
Nevertheless, when she had gone Guion rang for Reynolds and made

his usual careful toilet with uncommon elaboration. By the time his

guest arrived he was brushed and curled and stretched on the couch.

If he had in the back of his mind a hope of impressing Ashley and

showing him that if he, Guion, had fallen, it was from a height, he

couldn't help it. To be impressive was the habit of his

life—a habit it was too late now to overcome. Had he taken

the Strange Ride with Morrowby Jukes, he would have been impressive

among the living dead. Curiously enough, too, now that that

possibility was past, he wondered if he didn't regret it. He

confessed as much to Ashley.
"I know what you've come for," he said, when Ashley, who had

declined a cigar, seated himself beside the couch.
"That means, I suppose, that Olivia has got ahead of me."
"She told me what you've proposed. It's very fine—very

sporting."
"I haven't proposed it because it's either sporting or fine. It

seems to me the only thing to do."
"Y-es; I can understand that you should feel so about it. I

should myself if I were in your place and had a right to be

generous. The trouble is—that it wouldn't work."
Ashley would have given much not to feel this sudden

exhilaration of relief. It was so glowing that, in spite of his

repugnance, he could have leaned forward and wrung Guion's hand. He

contrived, however, to throw a tone of objection into his voice as

he said: "Wouldn't work? Why not?"
Guion raised himself on his elbow. "It's no use going over the

arguments as to the effect on your position. You've considered all

that, no doubt, and feel that you can meet it. Whether you could or

not when it came to the point is another question. But no matter.

There are one or two things you haven't considered. I hate to put

them before you, because—well, because you're a fine

fellow—and it's too bad that you should be in this fix. It's

part of my—my—my chastisement—to have put you

there; but it'll be something to me—some alleviation; if you

can understand—to help to get you out."
Ashley was dumb. He was also uncomfortable. He hated this sort

of thing.
Guion continued. "Suppose I were to let you go ahead on

this—let you raise the money—and take it from

you—and pay Davenant—and all that—then you might

marry my daughter, and get life on some sort of tolerable working

basis. I dare say." He pulled himself forward on the couch. Ashley

noticed the blazing of his eyes and hectic color in his cheeks.

"You might even be happy, in a way," he went on, "if you didn't

have—me."
"Didn't have—you? I don't understand—"
"And you'd have me. You couldn't get out of it. I'm

done for—I'm no good to any one any more—but I'm not

going to die. That's my point. That's my punishment, too. Can't you

imagine what it means to a man like me—who used to think well

of himself—who's been well thought of—can't you imagine

what it is to have to inspire every one who belongs to him with

loathing? That's what I've got to do for the rest of my

life—and I'm going to live."
"Oh, I say!"
"You mayn't believe it, Ashley, but I'd rather have

been—shut up—put away—where people couldn't see

me—where I didn't have to see them. You know Olivia and I

were facing that. I expect she's told you. And 'pon my soul there

are many ways in which it would have been easier than—than

this. But that's not what I'm coming to. The great fact is that

after you'd counted your cost and done your utmost you still have

me—like a dead rat strung round your

neck—"
"Oh, I say, by Jove!"
"Olivia, poor child, has to bear it. She can, too. That's a

remarkable thing about us New England people—our grit in the

face of disgrace. I fancy there are many of our women who'd be as

plucky as she—and I know one man. I don't know any

others."
Ashley felt sick. He had never in his life felt such repulsion

as toward what seemed to him this facile, theatrical remorse. If

Guion was really contrite, if he really wanted to relieve the world

of his presence, he could blow his brains out. Ashley had known, or

known of, so many who had resorted to this ready remedy for a

desperate plight that it seemed simple. His thoughts were too

complex, however, for immediate expression, and, before he could

decide what to respond, Guion said:
"Why don't you give him a chance?"
Ashley was startled. "Chance? What chance? Who?"
"Davenant."
Ashley grasped the back of his chair as though about to spring

up. "What's he want a chance for? Chance for what?"
"I might have said: 'Why don't you give her a chance?'

She's half in love with him—as it is."
"That's a lie. That's an infernal lie."
Ashley was on his feet. He pushed the chair from him, though he

still grasped it. He seemed to need it for support. Guion showed no

resentment, continuing to speak with feverish quiet.
"I think you'll find that the whole thing is predestined,

Ashley. Davenant's coming to my aid is what you might call a

miracle. I don't like to use the expression—it sounds

idiotic—and canting—and all that—but, as a matter

of fact, he came—as an answer to prayer."
Ashley gave a snort of impatience. Guion warmed to his subject,

dragging himself farther up on the couch and throwing the coverlet

from his knees.
"Yes, of course; you'd feel that way about it—naturally.

So should I if anybody else were to tell me. But this is how it

happened. One night, not long ago, while you were on the water, I

was so hard hit that I—well, I

actually—prayed. I don't know that I ever did

before—that is, not really—pray. But I did

then; and I didn't beat about the bush, either. I didn't stop at

half measures; I asked for a miracle right out and out—and I

got it. The next morning Davenant came with his offer of the money.

You may make what you like out of that; but I make—"
"I make this, by Jove; that you and he entered into a bargain

that he should supply the cash, and you should—"
"Wrong!" With his arm stretched to its full length he pointed

his forefinger up into Ashley's face. "Wrong!" he cried, again. "I

asked him if she had anything to do with it, and he said she

hadn't."
"Pff! Would you expect him to acknowledge it? He might deny it

till he damned his soul with lies; but that wouldn't keep you and

him from—"
"Before God, Ashley, I never thought of it till later. I know it

looks that way—the way you put it—but I never thought

of it till later. I dragged it out of him that he'd once been in

love with her and had asked her to marry him. That was a regular

knock-down surprise to me. I'd had no idea of anything of the kind.

But he said he wasn't in love with her any longer. I dare say he

thinks he isn't; but—"
"Suppose he is; that needn't affect her—except as

an impertinence. A woman can defend herself against that sort of

thing, by Jove!"
"It needn't affect her—only—only as a matter of

fact—it does. It appeals to her imagination. The big scale of

the thing would impress almost any woman. Look here, Ashley," he

cried, with a touch of hysteria; "it'll be better for us all in the

long run if you'll give him a chance. It'll be better for you than

for any one else. You'll be well out of it—any impartial

person would tell you that. You must see it yourself. You

do see it yourself. We're not your sort—"
But Ashley could stand it no longer. With a smothered,

inarticulate oath, he turned abruptly, and marched out of the

room.

XIX
F
ortunately there was no one in the upper hall,

nor on the stairs, nor in the lower hall, nor in the oval room into

which Ashley stumbled his way. The house was all sunshine and

silence. He dropped into the nearest arm-chair. "It's a lie," he

kept repeating to himself. "It's a lie. It's a damned, infernal

lie. It's a put-up job between them—between the old scoundrel

and that—that oaf."
The reflection brought him comfort. By degrees it brought him a

great deal of comfort. That was the explanation, of course! There

was no need of his being panic-stricken. To frighten him off was

part of their plan. Had he not challenged her two or three times to

say she didn't care for him? If she had any doubt on the subject he

had given her ample opportunity to declare it. But she had not done

so. On the contrary, she had made him both positive and negative

statements of her love. What more could he ask?
He breathed again. The longer he thought of it the better his

situation seemed to grow. He had done all that an honorable man

could think of. He had been chivalrous to a quixotic degree. If

they had not accepted his generous proposals, then so much the

worse for them. They—Guion and Davenant—were pursuing

obstructionist tactics, so as to put him in a place where he could

do nothing but retreat. Very well; he would show them! There were

points beyond which even chivalry could not go; and if they found

themselves tangled in their own barbed wire they themselves would

be to blame.
So, as the minute of foolish, jealous terror passed away, he

began to enjoy the mellow peace of the old house. It was the first

thing he had enjoyed since landing in America. His pleasure was

largely in the anticipation of soon leaving that country with all

the honors and Olivia Guion besides.
It was a gratification to the Ashley spirit, too, to note how

promptly the right thing had paid. It was really something to take

to heart. The moral to be drawn from his experiences at the heights

of Dargal had been illustrated over and over again in his career;

and this was once more. If he had funked the sacrifice it would

have been on his conscience all the rest of his life. As it was, he

had made it, or practically made it, and so could take his reward

without scruple.
He put this plainly before Olivia when at last she appeared. She

came slowly through the hail from the direction of the dining-room,

a blank-book and a pencil in her hand.
"I'm making an inventory," she explained. "You know that

everything will have to be sold?"
He ignored this to hurry to his account of the interview with

Guion. It had been brief, he said, and in a certain sense

unsatisfactory. He laid stress on his regret that her father should

have seen fit to decline his offer—that's what it amounted

to—but he pointed out to her that that bounder Davenant, who

had doubtless counseled this refusal, would now be the victim of

his own wiles. He had overreached himself. He had taken one of

those desperate risks to which the American speculative spirit is

so often tempted—and he had pushed it too far. He would lose

everything now, and serve him right!
"I've made my offer," he went on, in an injured tone, "and

they've thrown it out. I really can't do more, now, can I?"
"You know already how I feel about that."
They were still standing. He had been too eager to begin his

report to offer her a chair or to take one himself.
"They can't expect me to repeat it, now, can they?" he hurried

on. "There are limits, by Jove! I can't go begging to

them—"
"I don't think they expect it."
"And yet, if I don't, you know—he's dished. He loses his

money—and everything else."
In putting a slight emphasis on the concluding words he watched

her closely. She betrayed herself to the extent of throwing back

her head with a little tilt to the chin.
"I don't believe he'd consider that being dished. He's the sort

of man who loses only when he—flings away."
"He's the sort of man who's a beastly cad."
He regretted these words as soon as they were uttered, but she

had stung him to the quick. Her next words did so again.
"Then, if so, I hope you won't find it necessary to repeat the

information. I mistook him for something very high—very high

and noble; and, if you don't mind, I'd rather go on doing it."
She swept him with a look such as he knew she must be capable of

giving, though he had never before seen it. The next second she had

slipped between the portières into the hail. He heard her

pause there.
It was inevitable that Guion's words should return to him: "Half

in love with him—as it is."
"That's rot," he assured himself. He had only to call up the

image of Davenant's hulking figure and heavy ways to see what rot

it was. He himself was not vain of his appearance; he had too much

to his credit to be obliged to descend to that; but he knew he was

a distinguished man, and that he looked it. The woman who could

choose between him and Davenant would practically have no choice at

all. That seemed to him conclusive.
Nevertheless, it was with a view to settling this question

beyond resurrection that he followed her into the hall. He found

her standing with the note-book still in her hand.
He came softly behind her and looked over her shoulder, his face

close to hers. She could feel his breath on her cheek, but she

tried to write.
"I'm sorry I said what I did," he whispered.
She stayed her pencil long enough to say: "I hope you're still

sorrier for having thought it."
"I'm sorry you know I think it. Since it affects you so

deeply—"
"It affects me deeply to see you can be unjust."
"I'm more than unjust. I'm—well you can fancy what I am,

when I say that I know some one who thinks you're more than half in

love with this fellow—as it is."
"Is that papa?"
"I don't see that it matters who it is. The only thing of

importance is whether you are or not."
"If you mean that as a question, I shall have to let you answer

it yourself."
"Would you tell me if—if you were?"
"What would be the use of telling you a thing that would make

you unhappy and that I couldn't help?"
"Am I to understand, then, that you are half in love

with him?"
She continued the effort to write.
"I think I've a right to press that question," he resumed. "Am

I, or am I not, to understand—"
She turned slowly. Her face was flushed, her eyes were

misty.
"You may understand this," she said, keeping her voice as much

under control as possible, "you may understand this, that I don't

know whom I'm in love with, or whether or not I'm in love with any

one. That's the best I can say. I'm sorry, Rupert—but I don't

think it's altogether my fault. Papa's troubles seem to have

transported me into a world where they neither marry nor are given

in marriage—where the whole subject is alien to—"
"But you said," he protested, bitterly, "no longer ago than

yesterday that you—loved me."
"And I suppose I do. I did in Southsea. I did—right up to

the minute when I learned what papa—and I—had been

doing all these years—and that if the law had been put in

force—You see, that's made me feel as if I were

benumbed—as if I were frozen—or dead. You mustn't blame

me too much—"
"My darling, I'm not blaming you. I'm not such a duffer but that

I can understand how you feel. It'll be all right. You'll come

round. This is like an illness, by Jove!—that's what it's

like. But you'll get better, dear. After we're married—if

you'll only marry me—"
"I said I'd do that, Rupert—I said it yesterday—if

you'd give up—what I understand you have given

up—"
He was on his guard against admitting this. "I haven't given it

up. They've made it impossible for me to do it; that's all. It's

their action, not mine."
"It comes to the same thing. I'm ready to keep my promise."
"You don't say it with much enthusiasm."
"Perhaps I say it with something better. I think I do. At the

same time I wish—"
"You wish what?"
"I wish I had attached another condition to it."
"It mayn't be too late for that even now. Let's have it."
"If I had thought of it," she said, with a faint, uncertain

smile, "I should have exacted a promise that you and he should

be—friends."
He spoke sharply. "Who? Me? That's a good 'un, by Jove! You may

as well understand me, dear, once and for all. I don't make friends

of cow-punchers of that sort."
"I do," she said, coldly, turning again to her note-book.

It was not strange that Ashley should pass the remainder of the

day in a state of irritation against what he called "this American

way of doing things." Neither was it strange that when, after

dinner in the evening, Davenant kept close to him as they were

leaving Rodney Temple's house, the act should have struck the

Englishman as a bit of odious presumption. Having tried vainly to

shake his companion off, he was obliged to submit to walking along

the Embankment with him, side by side.
He had not found the dinner an entertaining event. Drusilla

talked a great deal, but was uneasy and distraite. Rodney Temple

seemed to him "a queer old cove," while Mrs. Temple made no

impression on him at all. Olivia had urged her inability to leave

her father as an excuse for not coming. Davenant said little beyond

giving the information that he was taking leave of his host and

hostess to sleep that night in his old quarters in Boston and

proceed next day to Stoughton, Michigan. This fact gave him a

pretext for saying good night when Ashley did and leaving the house

in his company.
"We're going the same way, aren't we?" he asked, as soon as they

were outside.
"No," Ashley said, promptly; "you're taking the tram, and I

shall walk."
"I should like to walk, too, Colonel, if you don't mind."
Since silence raised the most telling objection, Ashley made no

reply. Taking out his cigarette-case, he lit a cigarette, without

offering one to his companion. The discourtesy was significant, but

Davenant ignored it, commenting on the extraordinary mildness of

the October night and giving items of information as to the normal

behavior of American autumn weather. As Ashley expressed no

appreciation of these data, the subject was dropped. There was a

long silence before Davenant nerved himself to begin on the topic

he had sought this opportunity to broach.
"You said yesterday, Colonel, that you'd like to pay me back the

money I've advanced to Mr. Guion. I'd just as soon you wouldn't,

you know."
Ashley deigned no answer. The tramp went on in silence broken

only by distant voices or a snatch of song from a students'

club-house near the river. Somewhere in the direction of Brookline

a locomotive kept up a puffing like the beating of a pulse.
"I don't need that money," Davenant began again. "There's more

where it came from. I shall be out after it—from to-morrow

on."
Ashley's silence was less from rudeness than from

self-restraint. All his nerves were taut with the need to visit his

troubles on some one's head. A soldiering life had not accustomed

him to indefinite repression of his irritable impulses, and now

after two or three days of it he was at the limit of his powers. It

was partly because he knew his patience to be nearly at an end that

he wanted to be alone. It was also because he was afraid of the

blind fury with which Davenant's mere presence inspired him. While

he expressed this fury to himself in epithets of scorn, he was

aware, too, that there were shades of animosity in it for which he

had no ready supply of terms. Such exclamatory fragments as forced

themselves up through the troubled incoherence of his thoughts were

of the nature of "damned American," "vulgar Yankee," "insolent

bounder," rendering but inadequately the sentiments of a certain

kind of Englishman toward his fancied typical American, a crafty

Colossus who accomplishes everything by money and brutal strength.

Had there been nothing whatever to create a special antagonism

between them, Ashley's feeling toward Davenant would still have

been that of a civilized Jack-the-Giant-Killer toward a stupendous,

uncouth foe. It would have had elements in it of fear, jealousy,

even of admiration, making at its best for suspicion and

neutrality, and at its worst for.... But Davenant spoke again.
"I'd a great deal rather, Colonel, that—"
The very sound of his voice, with its harsh consonants and its

absurd repetitions of the military title, grated insufferably on

Ashley's ear. He was beyond himself although he seemed cool.
"My good fellow, I don't care a hang what you'd a great deal

rather."
Ashley lit a fresh cigarette with the end of the old one,

throwing the stump into the river almost across Davenant's face, as

the latter walked the nearer to the railing.
The American turned slightly and looked down. The action, taken

in conjunction with his height and size and his refusal to be

moved, intensified Ashley's rage, which began now to round on

himself. Even the monotonous tramp-tramp of their footsteps, as the

Embankment became more deserted, got on his nerves. It was long

before Davenant made a new attempt to fulfil his mission.
"In saying what I said just now," he began, in what he tried to

make a reasonable tone, "I've no ax to grind for myself. If Miss

Guion—"
"We'll leave that name out," Ashley cried, sharply. "Only a

damned cad would introduce it."
Though the movement with which Davenant swung his left arm

through the darkness and with the back of his left hand struck

Ashley on the mouth was so sudden as to surprise no one more than

himself, it came with all the cumulative effect of twenty-four

hours' brooding. The same might be said of the spring with which

Ashley bounded on his adversary. It had the agility and strength of

a leopard's. Before Davenant had time to realize what he had done

he found himself staggering—hurled against the iron railing,

which threatened to give way beneath his weight. He had not taken

breath when he was flung again. In the dim light of the electrics

he could see the glare in Ashley's eyes and hear him panting.

Davenant, too, panted, but his wrath that had flared up like a

rocket had already come down like a stick.
"Look here," he stammered; "we—we—c-can't do this

sort of thing."
Ashley fell back. He, too, seemed to realize quickly the folly

of the situation. When he spoke it was less in anger than in

protest.
"By God, you struck me!"
"I didn't know it, Colonel. If I did, we're quits on

it—because—because you insulted me. Perhaps you didn't

know that. I'm willing to think you didn't—if you'll

only believe that the whole thing has been a mistake—a

damned, idiotic, tom-fool mistake."
The words had their effect. Ashley fell back still farther.

There was a sinking of his head and a shrinking of his figure that

told of reaction from the moment of physical excess.
A roadside bench was visible beneath an arc-lamp but a few yards

away. "Come and sit down," Davenant said, hoarsely. He found it

difficult to speak.
Ashley stumbled along. He sat down heavily, like a man spent

with fatigue or drink. With his elbows on his knees, he hid his

face in his hands, while his body rocked.
Davenant turned away, walking down the Embankment. He walked on

for fifty or sixty yards. He himself felt a curious sense of being

battered and used up. His heart pounded and the perspiration stood

on his brow. Putting his hand to his collar, he found his evening

cravat awry and his waistcoat pulled out of shape.
He grasped the rail, as if for support, looking off with

unseeing eyes into the night. Lights along the river-side were

reflected in the water; here and there a bridge made a long low

arch of lamps; more lights sprinkled the suburban hills, making a

fringe to the pall of stars. They grew pale, even while he looked

at them, as before a brighter radiance, and he knew that behind him

the moon was coming up. He thought of the moonrise of the previous

evening, when Olivia Guion had walked with him to the gate and let

her hand rest in his. He recalled her words, as he had recalled

them a hundred times that day, "The man I care for." He

went back over each phase of their conversation, as though it was

something he was trying to learn by heart. He remembered her

longing for her aunt de Melcourt.
All at once he struck the railing with the energy of a man who

has a new inspiration. "By George!" he said, half aloud, "that's an

idea—that's certainly an idea! I wonder if.... The

Indiana sailed last week ... it ought to be the turn of

the Louisiana the day after to-morrow. By George, I

believe I could make it if ..."
He hurried back to the bench where Ashley was still sitting. The

latter was upright now, his arm stretched along the back. He had

lit a cigarette.
Davenant approached to within a few feet. "Look here, Colonel,"

he said, gently, "we've got to forget this evening."
It was a minute or two before Ashley said: "What's the good of

forgetting one thing when there are so many others to

remember?"
"Perhaps we can forget them, too—one by one. I guess you

haven't understood me. I dare say I haven't understood you, either,

though I think I could if you'd give me a chance. But all I want to

say is this, that I'm—off—"
Ashley turned quickly. "Off? Where?"
"Where we're not likely to meet—for some little

time—again."
"Oh, but I say! You can't—"
"Can't what, Colonel?"
"Can't drop—drop out of the running—damn it all,

man! you can't—you can't—let it be a walk-over for

me—after all that's—"
"That's where you've made your mistake, Colonel, I guess. You

thought there was—was a—a race, so to speak—and

that I was in it. Well, I wasn't?"
"But what the deuce—?"
"I not only wasn't in it—but there was no race. There

never was. It was a walk-over for—for some one—from the

start. Now I guess I'll say good night."
He turned away abruptly, but, having taken a few steps, came

back again.
"Look here! Let's have a cigarette."
Ashley fumbled for his case, opened it, and held it up. "I say,

take two or three."
As Ashley lifted the one he was smoking to serve as a light

Davenant noticed that the hand trembled, and steadied it in the

grasp of his own.
"Thanks; and good night again," he said, briefly, as he strode

finally away into the darkness.

XX
I
t was not till the motor had actually got out

of Havre and was well along the dusty white road to the

château that Davenant began to have misgivings. Up to that

point the landmarks—and and the sea-marks—had been

familiar. On board the Louisiana, in London, in Paris,

even in Havre, he had felt himself on his accustomed beat. On

steamers or trains and in hotels he had that kind of confidence in

himself which, failing him somewhat whenever he entered the

precincts of domestic life, was sure to desert him altogether now,

as he approached the strange and imposing.
"Madame est à la campagne."
A black-eyed old woman had told him so on the previous day. For

the instant he was relieved, since it put off the moment of

confronting the great lady a little longer.
He had, in fact, rung the bell at the frowning portal in the rue

de l'Université with some trepidation. Suggestions of

grandeur and mystery beyond anything he was prepared to meet lay

within these seemingly fortified walls. At the same time it gave

glory to the glamour in which the image of Olivia Guion always

appeared to him to think she had passed and repassed these solemn

gates at will, and that the stately Louis Quinze

hôtel, of which the concierge allowed him a glimpse

across the courtyard, had, on and off, been her home for years. It

was one more detail that removed her beyond his sphere and made her

inaccessible to his yearnings.
From the obliging post-office clerk at the bank on which he

drew—a gentleman posted in the movements of all distinguished

Americans on the continent of Europe—he learned that "la

campagne" for the Marquise de Melcourt meant the château of

Melcourt-le-Danois in the neighborhood of Harfleur. He was

informed, moreover, that by taking the two-o'clock train to Havre

he could sleep that night at the Hôtel Frascati, and motor

out to Melcourt easily within an hour in the morning. It began then

to occur to him that what had presented itself at first as a

prosaic journey from Boston to Paris and back was becoming an

adventure, with a background of castles and noble dames.
Nevertheless, he took heart for the run to Havre, and except for

feeling at twilight the wistfulness that comes out of the Norman

landscape—the melancholy of things forgotten but not gone,

dead but still brooding wraith-like over the valley of the Seine,

haunting the hoary churches, and the turreted châteaux, and

the windings of the river, and the long lines of poplar, and the

villages and forests and orchards and corn-fields—except for

this, his spirits were good. If now and then he was appalled at

what he, a shy fellow with no antecedents to recommend him and no

persuasive powers, had undertaken, he thought of Olivia Guion. The

thing he was attempting became trivial when compared with the

possible benefits to her.
That reflections too, enabled him to come victoriously out of

three long hours of inward wrestling—three long hours spent

on the jetty which thrust itself into the sea just outside his

hotel at Havre. He supposed he had already fought the battle with

himself and won it. Its renewal on the part of powers within his

soul took him by surprise.
He had strolled out after dinner to the Chaussée des

États-Unis to while away the time before going to bed. Ships

and sailors, with the lights and sights and sounds of a busy port,

had for him the fascination they exert over most men who lead

rather sedentary lives. At that time in the evening the

Chaussée des États-Unis was naturally gay with the

landsman's welcome to the sailor on shore. The cafés were

crowded both inside and out. Singing came from one and the twang of

an instrument from another, all along the quay. Soldiers mingled

fraternally with sailors, and pretty young women, mostly bareheaded

and neatly dressed in black, mingled with both. It was what a

fastidious observer of life might call "low," but Davenant's

judgments had no severity of that kind. He looked at the merry

groups, composed for the most part of chance acquaintances, here

to-day and gone to-morrow, swift and light of love, with a curious

craving for fellowship. From the gatherings of friends he felt

himself invariably the one shut out.
It was this sense of exclusion that finally sent him away from

the cheerful quay to wander down the jetty which marks the line

where the Harbor of Grace, with its intricate series of basins and

docks, becomes the sea. It was a mild night, though the waves beat

noisily enough against the bastions of the pier. At intervals he

was swept by a scud of spray. All sorts of acrid odors were in the

wind—smells of tar and salt and hemp and smoke and

oil—the perfumes of sea-hazard and romance.
Pulling his cap over his brows and the collar of his ulster

about his ears, he sat down on the stone coping. His shoulders were

hunched; his hands hung between his knees. He did not care to

smoke. For a few minutes he was sufficiently occupied in tracing

the lines and the groupings of lights. He had been in Havre more

than once before, and knew the quai de Londres from the quai de New

York, and both from the quai du Chili. Across the mouth of the

Seine he could distinguish the misty radiance which must be

Trouville from that which must be Honfleur. Directly under his eyes

in the Avant Port the dim hulls of steamers and war-ships,

fishing-boats and tugs, lay like monsters asleep.
There was no reason why all this should make him feel

outside the

warm glow and life of things; but it did. It did worse in that it

inspired a longing for what he knew positively to be unattainable.

It stirred a new impulse to fight for what he had definitely given

up. It raised again questions he thought he had answered and

revived hopes he had never had to quench, since from the beginning

they were vain.
Were they vain? In taking this form the query became

more insidious—more difficult to debate and settle once for

all. To every argument there was a perpetually recurring, "Yes,

but—" with the memory of the instants when her hand rested in

his longer than there was any need for, of certain looks and lights

in her eyes, of certain tones and half-tones in her voice. Other

men would have made these things a beginning, whereas he had taken

them as the end. He had taken them as the end by a foregone

conclusion. They had meant so much to him that he couldn't conceive

of asking more, when perhaps they were nothing but the first

fruits.
The wind increased in violence; the spray was salt on his

mustache, and clung to the nap of his clothing. The radiance that

marked Trouville and Honfleur grew dim almost to extinction. Along

the quay the cafés began to diminish the number of their

lights. The cheerful groups broke up, strolling home to the mansard

or to the fo'castle, with bursts of drunken or drowsy song.

Davenant continued to sit crouched, huddled, bowed. He ceased to

argue, or to follow the conflict between self-interest and duty, or

to put up a fight of any kind. He was content to sit still and

suffer. In its own way suffering was a relief. It was the first

time he had given it a chance since he had brought himself to

facing squarely the fact of his useless, pointless love. He had

always dodged it by finding something to be done, or choked it down

by sheer force of will. Now he let it rush in on him, all through

him, all over him, flooding his mind and spirit, making his heart

swell and his blood surge and his nerves ache and his limbs throb

and quiver. If he could have formed a thought it would have been

that of the Hebrew Psalmist when he felt himself poured out like

water. He had neither shame for his manhood nor alarm for his pride

till he heard himself panting, panting raucously, with a sound that

was neither a moan nor a sob, but which racked him convulsively,

while there was a hot smarting in his eyes.
But in the end he found relief and worked his way out to a sort

of victory. That is to say, he came back to see, as he had seen all

along, that there was one clear duty to be done. If he loved Olivia

Guion with a love that was worthy to win, it must also be with a

love that could lose courageously. This was no new discovery. It

was only a fact which loneliness and the craving to be something to

her, as she was everything to him, had caused him for the moment to

lose sight of. But he came back to it with conviction. It was

conviction that gave him confidence, that calmed him, enabling him,

as a clock somewhere struck eleven, to get up, shake the sea-spray

from his person, and return to his hotel.
It was while he was going to bed that Rodney Temple's words came

back to him, as they did from time to time: "Some call it God."
"I wonder if it is—God," he questioned.

But the misgiving that beset him, as he motored out of Havre in

the morning, was of another kind. It was that which attaches to the

unlikely and the queer. Once having plunged into a country road,

away from railways and hotels, he felt himself starting on a

wild-goose chase. His assurance waned in proportion as conditions

grew stranger. In vain an obliging chauffeur, accustomed to

enlighten tourists as to the merits of this highway, pointed out

the fact that the dusty road along which they sped had

once—and not so many years ago—been the border of the

bed of the Seine, that the white cliffs towering above them on the

left, and edged along the top with verdure, marked the natural

brink of the river, and that the church so admirably placed on a

hillside was the shrine of a martyred maiden saint, whose body had

come ashore here at Graville, having been flung into the water at

Harfleur. Davenant was deaf to these interesting bits of

information. He was blind, too. He was blind to the noble sweep of

the Seine between soft green hills. He was blind to the craft on

its bosom—steamers laden with the produce of orchard and the

farm for England; Norwegian brigantines, weird as The Flying

Dutchman in their black and white paint, carrying ice or

lumber to Rouen; fishing-boats with red or umber sails. He was

blind to the villages, clambering over cliffs to a casino, a

plage, and a Hôtel des Bains, or nestling on the

uplands round a spire. He was blind to the picturesque wooded

gorges, through which little tributaries of the great river had

once run violently down from the table-land of the Pays de Caux. He

was blind to the charms of Harfleur, famous and somnolent, on the

banks of a still more somnolent stream. He resumed the working of

his faculties only when the chauffeur turned and said:
"Voilà, monsieur—voilà le château de

madame la marquise."
If it was possible for Davenant's heart to leap and sink in the

same instant, it did it then. It leaped at the sight of this white

and rose castle, with its towers and donjon and keep; it sank at

the thought that he, poor old unpretentious Peter Davenant, with no

social or personal passports of any kind, must force his way over

drawbridge and beneath portcullis—or whatever else might be

the method of entering a feudal pile—into the presence of the

châtelaine whose abode here must be that of some legendary

princess, and bend her to his will. Stray memories came to him of

Siegfrieds and Prince Charmings, with a natural gift for this sort

of thing, but only to make his own appearance in the rôle the

more absurd.
Melcourt-le-Danois had that characteristic which goes with all

fine and fitting architecture of springing naturally out of the

soil. It seemed as if it must always have been there. It was as

difficult to imagine the plateau on which it stood without it as to

see Mont Saint Michel merely as a rocky islet. The plateau crowned

a white bluff running out like the prow of a Viking ship into a

bend of the Seine, commanding the river in both directions. It was

clear at a glance that when Roger the Dane laid here the first

stone of his pirates' stronghold, to protect his port of Harfleur,

the salt water must have dashed right up against the chalky cliff;

but the centuries during which the silt of the Vosges had been

carried down the river and piled up against the rocks at its mouth,

had driven the castle inland for an eighth of a mile.

Melcourt-le-Danois which had once looked down into the very waves

now dominated in the first place a strip of gardens, and orchards

of small fruit, through which the, road from Harfleur to the

village of Melcourt, half a mile farther up the Seine, ran like a

bit of white braid.
Viewed from the summit of the cliff on which Davenant's motor

had stopped, the château was composed of two ancient towers

guarding the long, and relatively low, relatively modern, brick

mansion of the epoch of Louis Treize. The brick, once red, had

toned down now to a soft old rose; the towers, once white, were

splashed above the line to which the ivy climbed with rose and

orange. Over the tip of the bluff and down its side of southern

exposure, toward the village of Melcourt, ran a park of oak and

chestnut, in all the October hues of yellow and olive-brown.
But ten minutes later, when the motor had made a detour round

cliffs and little inlets and arrived at the main entrance to the

château, Davenant found the aspect of things less

intimidating. Through a high wrought-iron grille, surmounted by the

head of an armorial beast, he had the view of a Lenôtre

garden, all scrolls and arabesques. The towers, which at a distance

had seemed part of a continuous whole, now detached themselves. The

actual residence was no more imposing than any good-sized house in

America. Davenant understood the chauffeur to say that "Madame la

marquise l'avait modernisé jusqu'au bout des ongles."
Having summoned up courage to ring the bell, he found it

answered by a middle-aged woman with a face worn by time and

weather to the polished grooves and creases to which water wears a

rock.
"On ne visite pas le château."
She made the statement with the stony, impersonal air of one who

has to say the same thing a good many times a year. Davenant

pressed close to the grille, murmuring something of which she

caught the word "Madame."
"Madame la marquise n'est pas visible."
The quick Norman eye had, however, noticed the movement of

Davenant's hand, detecting there something more than a card. In

speaking she edged nearer the grille. Thrusting his fingers between

the curves of the iron arabesques, he said, in his best French:

"Prenez."
Measuring time by the pounding of his heart rather than the

ticking of his watch, it seemed to him he had a long time to wait

before the woman reappeared, handing him back his card through the

openwork of the grille, saying briefly: "Madame la marquise ne

reçoit pas." Perhaps it was the crestfallen look in the

blond giant's face that tempted her to add: "Je le regrette,

monsieur."
In the compassionate tone he read a hint that all was not lost.

Scribbling under his name the words: "Boston, Mass. Very urgent,"

he once more passed the card through the grille, accompanied by the

manual act that had won the woman's sympathy in the first

place.
"Allez, please," he said, earnestly,

"and—vite."
He found his penciled words effective, for presently the woman

came back. "Venez, monsieur," she said, as she unlocked the grille

with a large key carried beneath her apron. Her stony official

manner had returned.
As he drew near the house a young man sketching or writing under

a yew-tree looked up curiously. A few steps farther on a pretty

girl, in a Leghorn hat, clipping roses into a basket, glanced at

him with shy, startled eyes. In the hall, where he was left

standing, a young officer in sky-blue tunic and red breeches, who

had been strumming at a piano in an adjoining room, strolled to the

door and stared at him. A thin, black-eyed, sharp-visaged,

middle-aged lady, dressed in black and wearing a knitted

shawl—perhaps the mother of the three young people he had

just seen—came half-way down the strip of red carpet on the

stairs, inspected him, and went up again. It was all more

disconcerting than he had expected.
The great hall, of which the chief beauty was in the magnificent

sweep of the monumental stairway, with its elaborate wrought-iron

balustrade, struck him as a forbidding entry to a home. A

man-servant came at last to deliver him from the soft, wondering

eyes of the young officer, and lead him into a room which he had

already recognized as a library through the half-open door.
Here he had just time to get a blurred impression of portraits,

busts, Bull surfaces, and rich or ancient bindings—with views

through the long windows of the traffic on the Seine—when a

little old lady appeared in a doorway at the farther end of the

room. He knew she was a little old lady from all sorts of

indefinable evidence, in spite of her own efforts to be young. He

knew it in spite of fluffy golden hair and a filmy, youthful

morning robe that displayed the daintiness of her figure as well as

the expensiveness of her taste.
She tripped rapidly down the long room, with quick little steps

and a quick little swinging of the arms that made the loose

gossamer sleeves blow outward from the wrists. He recognized her

instantly as the Marquise de Melcourt from her resemblance, in all

those outlines which poudre de riz and cherry paste could not

destroy, to the Guion type. The face would have still possessed the

Guion beauty, had she given it a chance. Looking at it as she came

nearer, Davenant was reminded of things he had read of those

Mongolian tribes who are said to put on masks to hide their fear

and go resolutely forth to battle. Having always considered this a

lofty form of courage, he was inconsistent in finding its

reflection here—the fear of time beneath these painted cheeks

and fluffy locks, and the fight against it carried on by the

Marquise's whole brave bearing—rather pitifully comic.
Madame herself had no such feeling. She wore her mask with

absolute nonchalance, beginning to speak while still some yards

away.
"Eh, bien, monsieur?"
Davenant doubled himself up into a deep bow, but before he had

time to stammer out some apologetic self-introduction, she

continued:
"You've come from Davis and Stern, I suppose, on business. I

always tell them not to send me people, but to cable. Why didn't

they cable? They know I don't like Americans coming here. I'm

pestered to death with them—that is, I used to be—and I

should be still, if I didn't put 'em down."
The voice was high and chattering, with a tendency to crack. It

had the American quality with a French intonation. In speaking, the

Marquise made little nervous dashes, now to the right, now to the

left, as though endeavoring to get by some one who blocked her

way.
"I haven't come on business, my—my lady."
He used this term of respect partly from a frightened desire to

propitiate a great personage and partly because he couldn't think

of any other.
"Then what have you come on? If it's to see the

château you may as well go away. It's never shown. Those are

positive orders. I make no exceptions. They must have told you so

at the gate. But you Americans will dare anything. Mon Dieu, quel

tas de barbares!"
The gesture of her hands in uttering the exclamation was

altogether French, but she betrayed her oneness with the people she

reviled by saying: "Quel tah de bah-bah!"
"I haven't come to see the château either, my

lady—"
"You can call me madame," she interrupted, not without a

kindlier inflection on the hint.
He began again. "I haven't come to see the château,

either—madame. I've come to see you."
She made one of her little plunges. "Oh, indeed! Have

you? I thought you'd learned better than that—over there. You

used to come in ship-loads, but—"
He began to feel more sure of himself. "When I say I came to see

you, madame, I mean, I came to—to tell you something."
"Then, so long as it's not on business, I don't want to hear it.

I suppose you're one of Walter Davenant's boys? I don't consider

him any relation to me at all. It's too distant. If I acknowledged

all the cousins forced on me from over there I might as well

include Abraham and Adam. Are you the first or the second wife's

son?"
He explained his connection with the Davenant name. "But that

isn't what I came to talk about, madame—not about myself. I

wanted to tell you of—of your nephew—Mr. Henry

Guion."
She turned with a movement like that of a fleeing nymph, her

hand stretched behind her. "Don't. I don't want to hear about him.

Nor about my niece. They're strangers to me. I don't know

them."
"You'd like to know them now, madame—because they're in

great trouble."
She took refuge behind a big English arm-chair, leaning on the

back.
"I dare say. It's what they were likely to come to. I told my

niece so, the last time she allowed me the privilege of her

conversation. But I told her, too, that in the day of her calamity

she wasn't to look to me."
"She isn't looking to you, madame. I am. I'm looking to

you because I imagine you can help her. There's no one

else—"
"And has she sent you as her messenger? Why can't she come

herself, if it's so bad as all that—or write? I thought she

was married—to some Englishman."
"They're not married yet, madame; and unless you help her I

don't see how they're going to be—the way things stand."
"Unless I help her! My good fellow, you don't know what you're

saying. Do you know that she refused—refused

violently—to help me?"
He shook his head, his blue eyes betraying some incredulity.
"Well, then, I'll tell you. It'll show you. You'll be able to go

away again with a clear conscience, knowing you've done your best

and failed. Sit down."
As she showed no intention of taking a seat herself, he remained

standing.
"She refused the Duc de Berteuil." She made the statement with

head erect and hands flung apart. "I suppose you have no idea of

what that meant to me?"
"I'm afraid I haven't."
"Of course you haven't. I don't know an American who

would have. You're so engrossed in your own small

concerns. None of you have any conception of the things that really

matter—the higher things. Well, then, let me tell you. The

Duc de Berteuil is—or rather was—the greatest

parti in France. He isn't any more, because they've married him to

a rich girl from South America or one of those places—brown

as a berry—with a bust—" She rounded her arms to give

an idea of the bust. "Mais, n'importe. My niece refused him. That

meant—I've never confessed it to any one before—I've

been too proud—but I want you to understand—it meant my

defeat—my final defeat. I hadn't the courage to begin again.

C'était le désastre. C'était Sedan."
"Oh, madame!"
It seemed to him that her mouth worked with an odd piteousness;

and before going on she put up a crooked little jeweled hand and

dashed away a tear.
"It would have been everything to me. It would have put me where

I belong, in the place I've been trying to reach all these years.

The life of an American woman in Europe, monsieur, can be very

cruel. We've nothing to back us up, and everything to fight against

in front. It's all push, and little headway. They don't want us.

That's the plain English of it. They can't imagine why we leave our

own country and come over here. They're so narrow. They're selfish,

too. Everything they've got they want to keep for themselves. They

marry us—the Lord only knows why!—and nine times out of

ten all we get for it is the knowledge that we've been bamboozled

out of our own dots. There was René de Lonchartres

who married that goose Annie Armstrong. They ridiculed her when she

came over here, and at the same time clapped him on the back for

having got her. That's as true as you live. It's their way. They

would have ridiculed me, too, if I hadn't been determined years ago

to beat them on their own ground. I could have done it, too,

if—"
"If it had been worth while," he ventured.
"You know nothing about it. I could have done it if my niece had

put out just one little finger—when I'd got everything ready

for her to do it. Yes, I'd got everything ready—and yet she

refused him. She refused him after I'd seen them all—his

mother, his sisters, his two uncles—one of them in waiting on

the Duc d'Orléans—Philippe V., as we call

him—all of them the purest old noblesse d'epée in

Normandy."
Her agitation expressed itself again in little dartings to and

fro. "I went begging to them, as you might say. I took all their

snubs—and oh! so fine some of them were!—more delicate

than the point of a needle! I took them because I could see just

how I should pay them back. I needn't explain to you how that would

be, because you couldn't understand. It would be out of the

question for an American."
"I don't think we are good at returning snubs, madame.

That's a fact."
"You're not good at anything but making money; and you make that

blatantly, as if you were the first people in the world to do it.

Why, France and England could buy and sell you, and most of you

don't know it. Mais, n'importe. I went begging to them, as I've

told you. At first they wouldn't hear of her at any

price—didn't want an American. That was bluff, to get a

bigger dot. I had counted on it in advance. I knew well

enough that they'd take a Hottentot if there was money enough. For

the matter of that, Hottentot and American are much the same to

them. But I made it bluff for bluff. Oh, I'm sharp. I manage all my

own affairs in America—with advice. I've speculated a little

in your markets quite successfully. I know how I stand to within a

few thousand dollars of your money. I offered half a million of

francs. They laughed at it. I knew they would, but it's as much as

they'd get with a French girl. I went to a million—to a

million and a half—to two millions. At two

millions—that would be—let me see—five into

twenty makes four—about four hundred thousand dollars of your

money—they gave in. Yes, they gave in. I expected them to

hold out for it, and they did. But at that figure they made all the

concessions and gave in."
"And did he give in?" Davenant asked, with naïve

curiosity.
"Oh, I'd made sure of him beforehand. He and I understood each

other perfectly. He would have let it go at a million and a half.

He was next door to being in love with her besides. All he wanted

was to be well established, poor boy! But I meant to go up to two

millions, anyhow. I could afford it."
"Four hundred thousand dollars," Davenant said, with an idea

that he might convey a hint to her, "would be practically the

sum—"
"I could afford it," she went on, "because of those ridiculous

copper-mines—the Hamlet and Tecla. I wasn't rich before that.

My dot was small. No Guion I ever heard of was able to

save money. My father was no exception."
"You are in the Hamlet and Tecla!" Davenant's blue eyes were

wide open. He was on his own ground. The history of the Hamlet and

Tecla Mines had been in his own lifetime a fairy-tale come

true.
Madame de Melcourt nodded proudly. "My father had bought nearly

two thousand shares when they were down to next to nothing. They

came to me when he died. It was mere waste paper for years and

years. Then all of a sudden—pouff!—they began to go up

and up—and I sold them when they were near a thousand. I

could have afforded the two millions of francs—and I promised

to settle Melcourt-le-Danois on them into the bargain, when

I—if I ever should—But my niece wouldn't take

him—simply—would—not. Ah," she cried, in a

strangled voice, "c'était trop fort!"
"But did she know you were—what shall I

say?—negotiating?"
"She was in that stupid England. It wasn't a thing I could write

to her about. I meant it as a surprise. When all was settled I sent

for her—and told her. Oh, monsieur, vous n'avez pas

d'idée! Queue scène! Queue scène! J'ai failli

en mourir." She wrung her clasped hands at the recollection.
"That girl has an anger like a storm. Avec tous ses airs de

reine et de sainte—she was terrible. Never shall I forget

it—jamais! jam-ais! au grand jamais! Et puis," she added,

with a fatalistic toss of her hands, "c'était fini. It was

all over. Since then—nothing!"
She made a little dash as if to leave him, returning to utter

what seemed like an afterthought. "It would have made her. It would

have made me. We could have dictated to the Faubourg. We

could have humiliated them—like that." She stamped her foot.

"It would have been a great alliance—what I've been so much

in need of. The Melcourt—well, they're all very

well—old noblesse de la Normandie, and all that—but

poor!—mais pauvres!—and as provincial as a curé

de campagne. When I married my poor husband—but we won't go

into that—I've been a widow since I was so high—ever

since 1870—with my own way to make. If my niece hadn't

deserted me I could have made it. Now all that is

past—fini-ni-ni! The clan Berteuil has set the Faubourg

against me. They've the power, too. It's all so intricate, so

silent, such wheels within wheels—but it's done. They've

never wanted me. They don't want any of us—not for ourselves.

It's the sou!—the sou!—the everlasting sou! Noble or

peasant—it makes no difference. But if my niece hadn't

abandoned me—"
"Why shouldn't you come home, madame?" Davenant suggested,

touched by so much that was tragic. "You wouldn't find any one

after the sou there."
"They're all about me," she whispered—"the Melcourt.

They're all over the house. They come and settle on me, and I can't

shake them off. They suffocate me—waiting for the moment

when—But I've made my will, and some'll be disappointed. Oh,

I shall leave them Melcourt-le-Danois. It's mine. I bought it with

my own money, after my husband's death, and restored it when the

Hamlet and Tecla paid so well. It shall not go out of their

family—for my husband's sake. But," she added, fiercely,

"neither shall the money go out of mine. They shall know I have a

family. It's the only way by which I can force the knowledge on

them. They think I sprang out of the earth like a mushroom. You may

tell my niece as much as that—and let her get all the comfort

from it she can. That's all I have to say, monsieur. Good

morning."
The dash she made from him seeming no more final than those

which had preceded it, he went on speaking.
"I'm afraid, madame, that help is too far in the future to be of

much assistance now. Besides, I'm not sure it's what they want.

We've managed to keep Mr. Henry Guion out of prison. That danger is

over. Our present concern is for Miss Olivia Guion's

happiness."
As he expected, the shock calmed her. Notwithstanding her mask,

she grew suddenly haggard, though her eyes, which—since she

had never been able to put poudre de riz or cherry paste in

them—were almost as fine as ever, instantly flashed out the

signal of the Guion pride. Her fluffy head went up, and her little

figure stiffened as she entrenched herself again behind the

arm-chair. Her only hint of flinching came from a slackening in the

flow of speech and a higher, thinner quality in the voice.
"Has my nephew, Henry Guion, been doing

things—that—that would send him—to prison?"
In spite of herself the final words came out with a gasp.
"It's a long story, madame—or, at least, a complicated

one. I could explain it, if you'd give me the time."
"Sit down."
They took seats at last. Owing to the old lady's possession of

what she herself called a business mind he found the tale easy in

the telling. Her wits being quick and her questions pertinent, she

was soon in command of the facts. She was soon, too, in command of

herself. The first shock having passed, she was able to go into

complete explanations with courage.
"So that," he concluded, "now that Mr. Guion is safe, if Miss

Guion could only marry—the man—the man she cares

for—everything would be put as nearly right as we can make

it."
"And at present they are at a deadlock. She won't marry him if

he has to sell his property, and so forth; and he can't marry her,

and live in debt to you. Is that it?"
"That's it, madame, exactly. You've put it in a nutshell."
She looked at him hardly. "And what has it all got to do with

me?"
He looked at her steadily in his turn. "I thought perhaps you

wouldn't care to live in debt to me, either."
She was startled. "Who? I? En voilà une idée!"
"I thought," he went on, "that possibly the Guion sense of

family honor—"
"Fiddle-faddle! There's no sense of family honor among

Americans. There can't be. You can only have family honor where, as

with us, the family is the unit; whereas, with you, the unit is the

individual. The American individual may have a sense of honor; but

the American family is only a disintegrated mush. What you really

thought was that you might get your money back."
"If you like, madame. That's another way of putting it. If the

family paid me, Miss Guion would feel quite differently—and

so would Colonel Ashley."
"When you say the family," she sniffed, "you mean me."
"In the sense that I naturally think first of its most

distinguished member. And, of course, the greater the distinction

the greater must be—shall I call it the indignity?—of

living under an obligation—"
"Am I to understand that you put up this money—that's your

American term, isn't it?—that you put up this money in the

expectation that I would pay you back?"
"Not exactly. I put up the money, in the first place, to save

the credit of the Guion name, and with the intention, if you didn't

pay me back, to do without it."
"And you risked being considered over-officious."
"There wasn't much risk about that," he smiled. "They did think

me so—and do."
"And you got every one into a fix."
"Into a fix, but out of prison."
"Hm!"
She grew restless, uncomfortable, fidgeting with her rings and

bracelets.
"And pray, what sort of a person is this Englishman to whom my

niece has got herself engaged?"
"One of their very finest," he said, promptly. "As a soldier, so

they say, he'll catch up one day with men like Roberts and

Kitchener; and as for his private character—well, you can

judge of it from the fact that he wants to strip himself of all he

has so that the Guion name shall owe nothing to any one

outside—"
"Then he's a fool."
"From that point of view—yes. There are fools of

that sort, madame. But there's something more to him."
He found himself reciting glibly Ashley's claims as a suitor in

the way of family, position, and fortune.
"So that it would be what some people might call a good

match."
"The best sort of match. It's the kind of thing she's made

for—that she'd be happy in—regiments, and uniforms, and

glory, and presenting prizes, and all that."
"Hm. I shall have nothing to do with it." She rose with dignity.

"If my niece had only held out a little finger—"
"It was a case, madame," he argued, rising, too—"it was a

case in which she couldn't hold out a little finger without

offering her whole hand."
"You know nothing about it. I'm wrong to discuss it with you at

all. I'm sure I don't know why I do, except that—"
"Except that I'm an American," he suggested—"one of your

own."
"One of my own! Quelle idée! Do you like him—this

Englishman?"
He hedged. "Miss Guion likes him."
"But you don't."
"I haven't said so. I might like him well enough if—"
"If you got your money back."
He smiled and nodded.
"Is she in love with him?"
"Oh—deep!"
"How do you know? Has she told you so?"
"Y-es; I think I may say—she has."
"Did you ask her?"
He colored. "I had to—about something."
"You weren't proposing to her yourself, were you?"
He tried to take this humorously. "Oh no, madame—"
"You can't be in love with her, or you wouldn't be trying so

hard to marry her to some one else—not unless you're a bigger

fool than you look."
"I hope I'm not that," he laughed.
"Well, I shall have nothing to do with it—nothing. Between

my niece and me—tout est fini." She darted from him, swerving

again like a bird on the wing. "I don't know you. You come here

with what may be no more than a cock-and-bull story, to get inside

the château."
"I shouldn't expect you to do anything, madame, without

verifying all I've told you. For the matter of that, it'll be easy

enough. You've only to write to your men of business,

or—which would be better still—take a trip to America

for yourself."
She threw out her arms with a tragic gesture. "My good man, I

haven't been in America for forty years. I nearly died of it then.

What it must be like now—"
"It wouldn't be so fine as this, madame, nor so picturesque. But

it would be full of people who'd be fond of you, not for the

sou—but for yourself."
She did her best to be offended. "You're taking liberties,

monsieur. C'est bien américan, céla."
"Excuse me, madame," he said, humbly. "I only mean that they

are fond of you—at least, I I know Miss Guion is.

Two nights before I sailed I heard her almost crying for

you—yes, almost crying. That's why I came. I thought I'd come

and tell you. I should think it might mean something to

you—over here so long—all alone—to have some one

like that—such a—such a—such a wonderful young

lady wanting you—in her trouble—"
"And such a wonderful young man wanting his money back. Oh, I'm

not blind, monsieur. I see a great deal more than you think. I see

through and through you. You fancy you're throwing dust in my eyes,

and you haven't thrown a grain. Pouff! Oh, la, la! Mais, c'est

fini. As for my niece—le bon Dieu l' a bien punie. For me to

step in now would be to interfere with the chastisement of

Providence. Le bon Dieu is always right. I'll say that for Him.

Good morning." She touched a bell. "The man will show you to the

door. If you like to stroll about the grounds—now that you've

got in—well, you can."
With sleeves blowing she sped down the room as if on pinions.

The man-servant waited respectfully. Davenant stood his ground,

hoping for some sign of her relenting. It was almost over her

shoulder that she called back:
"Where are you staying?"
He told her.
"Stupid place. You'll find the Chariot d'Or at Melcourt a great

deal nicer. Simple, but clean. An old chef of mine keeps it. Tell

him I sent you. And ask for his poularde au riz."

XXI
"W
hat do you think of him?"
Ashley's tone indicated some uncertainty as to what he thought

himself. Indeed, uncertainty was indicated elsewhere than in his

tone. It seemed to hang about him, to look from his eyes, to take

form in his person. Perhaps this was the one change wrought in him

by a month's residence in America. When he arrived everything had

bespoken him a man aggressively positive with the habit of being

sure. His very attitude, now, as he sat in Rodney Temple's office

in the Harvard Gallery of Fine Arts, his hands thrust into his

pockets, his legs stretched apart, his hat on the back of his head,

suggested one who feels the foundations of the earth to have

shifted.
Rodney Temple, making his arrangements for leaving for the day,

met one question with another. "What do you?"
"You know him," Ashley urged, "and I don't."
"I thought you did. I thought you'd read him right off—as

a cow-puncher."
"He looks like one, by Jove! and he speaks like one, too. You

wouldn't call him a gentleman? What?"
"If you mean by a gentleman one who's always been able to take

the best in the world for granted, perhaps he isn't. But that isn't

our test—over here."
"Then, what is?"
"I'm not sure that I could tell you so that you'd

understand—at any rate, not unless you start out with the

fact that the English gentleman and the American differ not only in

species, but in genus. I'd go so far as to say that they've got to

be recognized by different sets of faculties. You get at your man

by the eye and the ear; we have to use a subtler apparatus. If we

didn't we should let a good many go uncounted. Some of our finest

are even more uncouth with their consonants than good friend

Davenant. They'd drop right out of your list, but they take a high

place in ours. To try to discern one by the methods created for the

other is like what George Eliot says of putting on spectacles to

detect odors. Ignorance of this basic social fact on both sides has

given rise to much international misjudgment. See?"
"Can't say that I do."
"No, you wouldn't. But until you do you won't understand a big

simple type—"
"I don't care a hang about his big simple type. What I want to

know is how to take him. Is he a confounded

sentimentalist?—or is he still putting up a bluff?"
"What difference does it make to you?"
"If he's putting up a bluff, he's waiting out there at Michigan

for me to call it. If he's working the sentimental racket, then

I've got to be the beneficiary of his beastly good-will."
"If he's putting up a bluff, you can fix him by not calling it

at all; and as for his beastly good-will, well, he's a beneficiary

of it, too."
"How so?"
"Because beastly good-will is a thing that cuts both ways. He'll

get as much out of it as you."
"That's all very fine—"
"It's very fine, indeed, for him. We've an old saying in these

parts: By the Street called Straight we come to the House called

Beautiful. It's one of those fanciful saws of which the only

justification is that it works. Any one can test the truth of it by

taking the highway. Well, friend Davenant is taking it. He'll reach

the House called Beautiful as straight as a die. Don't you fret

about that. You'll owe him nothing in the long run, because he'll

get all the reward he's entitled to. When's the wedding? Fixed the

date yet?"
"Not going to fix one," Ashley explained, moodily. "One of these

days, when everything is settled at Tory Hill and the sale is over,

we shall walk off to the church and get married. That seems to be

the best way, as matters stand."
"It's a very sensible way at all times. And I hear you're

carrying Henry off with you to England."
Ashley shrugged his shoulders. "Going the whole hog. What? Had

to make the offer. Olivia couldn't leave him behind. Anything that

will make her happy—"
"Will make you happy."
"That's about the size of it."
Having locked the last drawer and put out the desk light, Temple

led his guest down the long gallery and across the Yard to the

house on Charlesbank. Here Ashley pursued kindred themes in the

company of Mrs. Fane, finding himself alone with her at tea. He was

often alone with her at tea, her father having no taste for this

form of refreshment, while her mother found reasons for being

absent.
"Queer old cove, your governor," Ashley observed, stretching

himself comfortably before the fire. The blaze of logs alone lit up

the room.
"Is that why you seem to have taken a fancy to him?"
"I like to hear him gassing. Little bit like the Bible, don't

you know."
"He's very fond of the Bible."
"Seems to think a lot of that chap—your governor."
A nod supposed to indicate the direction of the State of

Michigan enabled her to follow his line of thought.
"He does. There's something rather colossal about the way he's

dropped out—"
"A jolly sight too colossal. Makes him more important than if

he'd stayed on the spot and fought the thing to a finish."
"Fought what thing to a finish?"
He was sorry to have used the expression. "Oh, there's still a

jolly lot to settle up, you know."
"But I thought everything was arranged—that you'd accepted

the situation."
He stretched himself more comfortably before the fire. "We'd a

row," he said, suddenly.
"A row? What kind of a row?"
"A street row—just like two hooligans. He struck me."
"Rupert!" She half sprang up. "He—"
Ashley swung round in his chair. He was smiling.
"Oh, I beg your pardon," she cried, in confusion. "I

can't think what made me call you that. I never

do—never. It was the surprise—and the

shock—"
"That's all right," he assured her. "I often call you Drusilla

when I'm talking to Olivia. I don't see why we

shouldn't—we've always been such pals—and we're going

to be a kind of cousins—"
"Tell me about Peter."
"Oh, there's nothing much that stands telling. We were two

idiots—two silly asses. I insulted him—and he struck

out. I called him a cad—I believe I called him a damned

cad."
"To his face?"
"To his nose."
"Oh, you shouldn't have done that."
"And he got mad, by Jove! Oh, it didn't last. We pulled off in a

second or two. We saw we were two idiots—two kids. It wasn't

worth getting on one's high horse about—or attempting to

follow it up—it was too beastly silly for

heroics—except that—that he—"
"Except that he—what?"
"Except that he—got the better of me. He has the better of

me still. And I can't allow that, by Jove! Do you see?"
"I don't see very clearly. In what way did he get the better of

you?"
"In the whole thing—the way he carried it off—the

whole silly business."
"Then I don't see what's to be done about it now."
"Something's got to be done, by Jove! I can't let it go at

that."
"Well, what do you propose?"
"I don't propose anything. But I can't go through life letting

that fellow stay on top. Why, considering everything—all he's

done for Olivia and her father—and now this other

thing—and his beastly magnanimity besides—he's

frightfully on top. It won't do, you know. But I say, you'll not

tell Olivia, will you? She'd hate it—about the row, I mean. I

don't mind your knowing. You're always such a good pal to

me—"
It was impossible to go on, because Mrs. Temple bustled in from

the task of helping Olivia with the packing and sacking at Tory

Hill. Having greeted Ashley with the unceremoniousness permissible

with one who was becoming an intimate figure at the fireside, she

settled to her tea.
"Oh, so sad!" she reflected, her little pursed-up mouth

twitching nervously. "The dear old house all dismantled! Everything

to go! I've asked Henry to come and stay here. It's too

uncomfortable for him, with all the moving and packing going on

around him. It'll be easier for dear Olivia, too. So hard for her

to take care of him, with all the other things she has on her

hands. There's Peter's room. Henry may as well have it. I don't

suppose we shall see anything more of Peter for ages to come. But I

do wish he'd write. Don't you, Colonel Ashley? I've written to him

three times now—and not a line from him! I suppose they must

be able to get letters out there, at Stoughton, Michigan. It can't

be so far beyond civilization as all that. And Olivia would like

it. She's worried about him—about his not writing—and

everything. Don't you think, Colonel Ashley?"
Ashley looked blank. "I haven't noticed it—"
"Oh, I have. A woman's eye sees those little things, don't you

think? Men have so much on their hands—the great things of

the world—but the little things, they often count, don't you

think? But I tell dear Olivia not to worry. Everything will come

right. Things do come right—very often. I'm more pessimistic

than Rodney—that I must say. But still I think things have a

way of coming right when we least expect it. I tell dear Olivia

that Peter will send a line just when we're not looking for it.

It's the watched pot that never boils, you know, and so I tell her

to stop watching for the postman. That's fatal to getting a

letter—watching for the postman. How snug you two look here

together! Well, I'll run up and take off my things. No; no more

tea, dear. I won't say good-by, Colonel Ashley, because you'll be

here when I come down."
Mrs. Temple was a good woman who would have been astonished to

hear herself accused of falsehood but, as a matter of fact, her

account of the conversation with Olivia bore little relation to the

conversation itself. What she had actually said was:
"Poor Peter! I suppose he doesn't write because he's trying to

forget."
The challenge here being so direct, Olivia felt it her duty to

take it up. The ladies were engaged in sorting the linen in

preparation for the sale.
"Forget what?"
"Forget Drusilla, I suppose. Hasn't it struck you—how much

he was in love with her?"
Olivia held a table-cloth carefully to the light. "Is this Irish

linen or German? I know mamma did get some at Dresden—"
Mrs. Temple pointed out the characteristic of the Belfast weave

and pressed her question. "Haven't you noticed it—about

Peter?"
Olivia tried to keep her voice steady as she said: "I've no

doubt I should have seen it if I hadn't been so preoccupied."
"Some people think—Rodney, for instance—that he'd

lost his head about you, dear; but we mothers have an

insight—"
"Of course! There seems to be one missing from the dozen of this

pattern."
"Oh, it'll turn up. It's probably in the pile over there. I

thought I'd speak about it, dear," she went on, "because it must be

a relief to you not to have that complication. Things are so

complicated already, don't you think? But if you haven't Peter on

your mind, why, that's one thing the less to worry about. If you

thought he was in love with you, dear—in your

situation—going to be married to some one else—But you

needn't be afraid of that at all. I never saw a young man more in

love with any one than he is with Drusilla—and I think she

must have refused him. If she hadn't he would never have shot off

in that way, like a bolt from the blue—But what's the matter,

dear? You look white. You're not ill?"
"It's the smell of lavender," Olivia gasped, weakly. "I never

could endure it. I'll just run into the air a minute—"
This was all that passed between Olivia and Mrs. Temple on the

subject. If the latter reported it with suppressions and

amplifications it was doubtless due to her knowledge of what could

be omitted as well as of what would have been said had the topic

been pursued. In any case it caused her to sigh and mumble as she

went on with her task of folding and unfolding and of examining

textures and designs:
"Oh, how mixy! Such sixes and sevens! Everything the wrong way

round! My poor Drusilla!—my poor little girlie! And such a

good position! Just what she's capable of filling!—as well as

Olivia—better, with all her experience of their army. ''Tis

better to have loved and lost,' dear Tennyson says; but I don't

know. Besides, she's done that already—with poor

Gerald—and now, to have to face it all a second time—my

poor little girlie!"
As for Olivia, she felt an overpowering desire to flee away.

Speeding through the house, where workmen were nailing up cases or

sacking rugs, she felt that she was fleeing—fleeing

anywhere—anywhere—to hide herself. As a matter of fact,

the flight was inward, for there was nowhere to go but to her room.

Her way was down the short staircase from the attic and along a

hall; but it seemed to her that she lived through a succession of

emotional stages in the two or three minutes it took to cover it.

Her first wild cry "It isn't true! It isn't true!" was followed by

the question "Why shouldn't it be true?" to end with her asking

herself: "What difference does it make to me?"
"What difference can it make to me?"
She had reached that form of the query by the time she took up

her station at the window of her room, to stare blankly at the

November landscape. She saw herself face to face now with the

question which, during the past month, ever since Davenant's sudden

disappearance, she had used all her resources to evade. That it

would one day force itself upon her she knew well enough; but she

hoped, too, that before there was time for that she would have

pronounced her marriage vows, and so burned her bridges behind her.

Amid the requirements of duty, which seemed to shift from week to

week, the one thing stable was the necessity on her part to keep

her promise to the man who had stood by her so nobly. If once it

had seemed to her that Davenant's demands—whatever they might

prove to be—would override all others, it was now quite clear

that Ashley's claim on her stood first of all. He had been so

loyal, so true, so indifferent to his own interests! Besides, he

loved her. It was now quite another love from that of the romantic

knight who had wooed a gracious lady in the little house at

Southsea. That tapestry-tale had ended on the day of his arrival at

Tory Hill. In its place there had risen the tested devotion of a

man for a woman in great trouble, compelled to deal with the most

sordid things in life. He had refused to be spared any of the

details she would have saved him from or to turn away from any of

the problems she was obliged to face. His very revolt against it,

that repugnance to the necessity for doing it which he was not at

all times able to conceal, made his self-command in bringing

himself to it the more worthy of her esteem. He had the defects of

his qualities and the prejudices of his class and profession; but

over and above these pardonable failings he had the marks of a

hero.
And now there was this thing!
She had descried it from afar. She had had a suspicion of it

before Davenant went away. It had not created a fear; it was too

strange and improbable for that; but it had brought with it a sense

of wonder. She remembered the first time she had felt it, this

sense of wonder, this sense of something enchanted, outside life

and the earth's atmosphere. It was at that moment on the lawn when,

after the unsuccessful meeting between Ashley and Davenant, she had

turned with the latter to go into the house. That there was a

protective, intimate element in her feeling she had known on the

instant; but what she hadn't known on the instant, but was

perfectly aware of now, was that her whole subconscious being, had

been crying out even then: "My own! My own!"
With the exaggeration of this thought she was able to get

herself in hand. She was able to debate so absurd a suggestion, to

argue it down, and turn it into ridicule. But she yielded again as

the Voice that talked with her urged the plea: "I didn't say you

knew it consciously. You couldn't cry 'My own! My own!' to a man

whom up to that point you had treated with disdain. But your

subliminal being had begun to know him, to recognize him

as—"
To elude this fancy she set herself to recapitulating his weak

points. She could see why Ashley should thrust him aside as being

"not a gentleman." He fell short, in two or three points, of the

English standard. That he had little experience of life as it is

lived, of its balance and proportion and perspective, was clear

from the way in which he had flung himself and his money into the

midst of the Guion disasters. No man of the world could possibly

have done that. The very fact of his doing it made him lawfully a

subject for some of the epithets Ashley applied to him. Almost any

one would apply them who wanted to take him from a hostile point of

view.
She forgot herself so far as to smile faintly. It was just the

sort of deficiency which she had it in her power to make up. The

reflection set her to dreaming when she wanted to be doing

something else. She could have brought him the dower of all the

things he didn't know, while he could give her.... But she caught

herself again.
"What kind of a woman am I?"
She began to be afraid. She began to see in herself the type she

most detested—the woman who could deliberately marry a man

and not be loyal to him. She was on the threshold of marriage with

Ashley, and she was thinking of the marvel of life with some one

else. When one of the inner Voices denied this charge, another

pressed it home by nailing the precise incident on which her heart

had been dwelling. "You were thinking of this—of

that—of the time on the stairs when, with his face close to

yours, he asked you if you loved the man you'd be going away

with—of the evening at the gate when your hand was in his and

it was so hard to take it away. He has no position to offer you.

There's nothing remarkable about him beyond a capacity for making

money. He's beneath you from every point of view except that of his

mere manhood, and yet you feel that you could let yourself slip

into that—into the strength and peace of it—"
She caught herself again—impatiently. It was no use! There

was something wilful within her, something that could be called by

even a stronger name, that worked back to the point from which she

tried to flee, whatever means she took to get away from it.
She returned to her work, persuading Cousin Cherry to go home to

tea and leave her to finish the task alone. Even while she did so

one of the inner Voices taunted her by saying: "That'll leave you

all the more free to dream of—him."

Some days passed before she felt equal to talking about Davenant

again. This time it was to the tinkling silver, as she and Drusilla

Fane sorted spoons and forks at the sideboard in the dismantled

dining-room. Olivia was moved to speak in the desperate hope that

one stab from Drusilla—who might be in a position to deliver

it—would free her from the obsession haunting her.
There had been a long silence, sufficiently occupied, it seemed,

in laying out the different sorts and sizes of spoons in rows of a

dozen, while Mrs. Fane did the same with the forks.
"Drusilla, did Mr. Davenant ever say anything to you about

me?"
She was vexed with herself for the form of her question. It was

not Davenant's feeling toward her, but toward Drusilla,

that she wanted to know. She was drawing the fire in the wrong

place. Mrs. Fane counted her dozen forks to the end before

saying:
"Why, yes. We've spoken of you."
Having begun with a mistake, Olivia went on with it. "Did he

say—anything in particular?"
"He said a good many things, on and off."
"Some of which might have been—in particular?"
"All of them, if it comes to that."
"Why did you never tell me?"
"For one reason, because you never asked me."
"Have you any idea why I'm asking you now?"
"Not the faintest. I dare say we sha'n't see anything more of

him for years to come."
"Did you—did you—refuse him? Did you send him

away?"
"Well, that's one thing I didn't have to do, thank the Lord.

There was no necessity. I was afraid at one time that mother might

make him propose to me—she's terribly subtle in that way,

though you mightn't think it—but she didn't. No; if Peter's

in love with any one, it's not with me."
Olivia braced herself to say, "And I hope it's not with me."
Drusilla went on counting.
"Did he ever say anything about that?" Olivia persisted.
Drusilla went on counting. "Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

That's all of that set. What a lot of silver you've got! And some

of it must have been in the family for thousands of years. Yes,"

she added, in another tone, "yes, he did. He said he wasn't."
Olivia laid down the ladle she was holding with infinite

precaution. She had got the stab she was looking for. It seemed for

a minute as if she was free—gloatingly free. He hadn't cared

anything about her after all, and had said so! She steadied herself

by holding to the edge of the sideboard.
Drusilla stooped to the basket of silver standing on the floor,

in a seemingly passionate desire for more forks. By the time she

had straightened herself again, Olivia was able to say: "I'm so

glad of that. You know what his kindness in helping papa has made

people think, don't you?"
But Mrs. Fane astonished her by throwing down her handful of

silver with unnecessary violence of clang and saying: "Look here,

Olivia, I'd rather not talk about it any more. I've reasons. I

can't take a hand in your affairs without being afraid that

perhaps—perhaps—I—I—sha'n't play the

game."
Olivia was silent, but she had much to think of.
It was a few days later still that she found herself in Rodney

Temple's little office in the Gallery of Fine Arts. She had come

ostensibly to tell him that everything had been arranged for the

sale.
"Lemon and Company think that early in December would be the

best time, as people are beginning then to spend money for

Christmas. Mr. Lemon seems to think we've got a good many things

the smaller connoisseurs will want. The servants are to go next

Tuesday, so that if you and Cousin Cherry could take papa

then—I'm to stay with Lulu Sentner; and I shall go from her

house to be married—some day, when everything else is

settled. Did you know that before Mr. Davenant went away he left a

small bank account for papa?—two or three thousand

dollars—so that we have money to go on with. Rupert wants to

spend a week or two in New York and Washington, after which we

shall come back here and pick up papa. He's not very keen on coming

with us, but I simply couldn't—"
He nodded at the various points in her recital, blinking at her

searchingly out of his kind old eyes.
"You look pale," he said, "and old. You look forty."
She surprised him by saying, with a sudden outburst: "Cousin

Rodney, do you think it's any harm for a woman to marry one man

when she's in love with another?" Before he had time to recover

himself, she followed this question with a second. "Do you think

it's possible for a person to be in love with two people at the

same time?"
He understood now the real motive of her visit.
"I'm not a very good judge of love affairs," he said, after a

minute's reflection. "But one thing I know, and it's

this—that when we do our duty we don't have to bother with

the question as to whether it's any harm or not."
"We may do our duty, and still make people unhappy."
"No; not unless we do it in the wrong way."
"So that if I feel that to go on and keep my word is the right

thing—or rather the only thing—?"
"That settles it, dearie. The right thing is the only

thing—and it makes for everybody's happiness."
"Even if it seems that it—it couldn't?"
"I'm only uttering platitudes, dearie, when I say that happiness

is the flower of right. No other plant can grow it; and that plant

can't grow any other flower. When you've done the thing you feel

you're called to do—the thing you couldn't refuse while still

keeping your self-respect—well, then, you needn't be afraid

that any one will suffer in the long run—and yourself least

of all."
"In the long run! That means—"
"Oh, there may be a short run. I'm not denying that. But no one

worth his salt would be afraid of it. And that, dearie," he added,

blinking, "is all I know about love affairs."
There being no one in the gallery on which the office opened,

she kissed him as she thanked him and went away. She walked

homeward, taking the more retired streets through Cambridge and

into Waverton, so as to be the more free for thinking. It was a

relief to her to have spoken out. Oddly enough, she felt her heart

lighter toward Davenant from the mere fact of having told some one,

or having partially told some one, that she loved him.
When, on turning in at the gate of Tory Hill, she saw a taxicab

standing below the steps of the main entrance, she was not

surprised, since Ashley occasionally took one to run out from town.

But when a little lady in furs and an extravagant hat stepped out

to pay the chauffeur Olivia stopped to get her breath. If it hadn't

been impossible she would have said—
But the taxicab whizzed away, and the little lady tripped up the

steps.
Olivia felt herself unable to move. The motor throbbed past her,

and out the gate, but she still stood incapable of going farther.

It seemed long before the pent-up emotions of the last month or

two, controlled, repressed, unacknowledged, as they had been, found

utterance in one loud cry: "Aunt Vic!"
Not till that minute had she guessed her need of a woman, a

Guion, one of her very own, a mother, on whose breast to lay her

head and weep her cares out.

The first tears since the beginning of her trials came to Olivia

Guion, as, with arms clasped round her aunt and forehead pressed

into the little old lady's furs, she sat beside her on a

packing-case in the hail. She cried then as she never knew before

she was capable of crying. She cried for the joy of the present,

for the trouble of the past, and for the relief of clinging to some

one to whom she had a right. Madame de Melcourt would have cried

with her, had it not been for the effect of tears on cosmetics.
"There, there, my pet," she murmured, soothingly. "Didn't you

know your old auntie would come to you? Why didn't you cable?

Didn't you know I was right at the end of the wire. There now, cry

all you want to. It'll do you good. Your old auntie has come to

take all your troubles away, and see you happily married to your

Englishman. She's brought your dot in her

pocket—same old dot!—and everything. There

now, cry. There's nothing like it."

XXII
M
adame de Melcourt the chief novelty of American

life, for the first few days at least, lay in the absence of any

necessity for striving. To wake up in the morning into a society

not keeping its heart hermetically shut against her was distinctly

a new thing. Not to have to plan or push or struggle, to take snubs

or repay them, to wriggle in where she was not wanted, or to keep

people out where she had wriggled in, was really amusing. In the

wide friendliness by which she found herself surrounded she had a

droll sense of having reached some scholastic paradise painted by

Puvis de Chavannes. She was even seated on a kind of throne, like

Justitia or Sapientia, with all kinds of flattering, welcoming

attentions both from old friends who could remember her when she

had lived as a girl among them and new ones who were eager to take

her into hospitable arms. It was decidedly funny. It was like

getting into a sphere where all the wishes were gratified and there

were no more worlds to conquer. It would pall in the end; in the

end she would come to feel like a gourmet in a heaven where there

is no eating, or an Englishman in some Blessed Isle where there is

no sport; but for the moment it offered that refreshing change

which strengthens the spirit for taking up the more serious things

of life again. In any case, it put her into a good-humor of which

the residents at Tory Hill were the first to feel the effect.
"Il est très bien, ton Anglais."
Olivia acknowledged this approval with a smile and a blush, as

she went about the drawing-room trying to give it something of its

former air. With the new turn of events it had become necessary to

restore the house to a condition fit for occupancy. Madame de

Melcourt had moved into it with her maid and her man, announcing

her intention to remain till she got ready to depart. Her bearing

was that of Napoleon making a temporary stay in some German or

Italian palace for the purposes of national reorganization and

public weal. At the present instant she was enthroned amid cushions

in a corner of the sofa, watching Olivia dispose of such

bric-à-brac as had not been too remotely packed away.
"I always say," the old lady declared, "that when an Englishman

is chic he's very chic, and your Ashley is no exception. I don't

wonder you're in love with him."
When seated the Marquise accompanied her words with little

jerkings and perkings of her fluffy head, with wavings of the hands

and rollings of the eyes—the corelatives of her dartings and

dashings while on her feet.
It was easy for Olivia to keep her back turned, while she

managed to say: "He thinks you don't like him."
Madame shrugged her shoulders. "I like him as well as I could

like any Englishman. He's very smart. You can see at a glance he's

some one. From what I'd heard of him—his standing by you and

all that—I was afraid he might be an eccentric."
"Whom did you hear it from?"
"Oh, I heard it. There's nothing wonderful in that. A thing

that's been the talk of Boston and New York, and telegraphed to the

London papers—you don't suppose I shouldn't hear of it some

time. And I came right over—just as soon as I was convinced

you needed me."
Olivia looked round with misty eyes. "I shall never forget it,

Aunt Vic, dear—nor your kindness to papa. He feels it more

than he can possibly express to you—your taking what he did

so—so gently."
"Ma foi! The Guions must have money. When it comes to spending

they're not morally responsible. I'm the only one among them who

ever had a business head; and even with me, if it hadn't been for

my wonderful Hamlet and Tecla—But you can see what I am at

heart—throwing two million francs into your lap as if it were

a box of bonbons."
"I'm not sure that you ought, you know."
"And what about the Guion family honor and all that? Who's to

take care of it if I don't? The minute I heard what had happened I

held up my head and said, Everything may go so long as the credit

of the Guion name is saved. N'est-ce pas? We can't live in debt to

the old man who advanced your papa the money."
"He isn't an old man at all," Olivia explained, quickly.
"Ça ne fait rien. His age isn't the question. I suppose

he lent the money expecting us to pay him back at a handsome rate

of interest."
"No, he didn't. That's just it. He lent it to us—out

of—out of—"
"Yes; out of what?"
"Out of pure goodness," she said, firmly.
"Fiddle-faddle! People don't do things out of pure goodness. The

man who seems to is either a sentimentalist or a knave. If he's a

sentimentalist, he does it for effect; if he's a knave, because it

helps roguery. There's always some ax to grind."
"I think you'd have to make an exception of Mr. Davenant."
"Davenant? Is that his name? Yes, I believe your papa did tell

me so—the boy Tom Davenant fished out of the slums."
With some indignation Olivia told the story of Davenant's birth

and adoption. "So you see," she went on, "he has goodness in his

blood. There's no reason why that shouldn't be inherited as much

as—as insanity—or a taste for alcohol."
"Stuff, dear! The man or the boy, or whatever he is, calculated

on getting something better than he gave. We must simply pay him

off and get rid of him. Noblesse oblige."
"We may get rid of him, Aunt Vic, but we can never pay him

off."
"He'll be paid off, won't he, if we return his loan at an

interest of five—I'm willing to say six—per cent.?"
Olivia came forward, looking distressed. "Oh, I hope you won't,

dear Aunt Vic. I mean about the five or six per cent. Give him back

his money if you will, only give it back in the—in the

princely way in which he let us have it."
"Well, I call that princely—six per cent."
"Oh, please, Aunt Vic! You'd offend him. You'd hurt him. He's

just the sort of big, sensitive creature that's most easily

wounded, and—"
"Tiens! You interest me. Stop fidgeting round the room and come

and tell me about him. Sit down," she commanded, pointing to the

other corner of the sofa. "There must be a lot I haven't

heard."
If Olivia hesitated, it was chiefly because of her own eagerness

to talk of him, to sing his praises. Since, however, she must

sooner or later learn to do this with self-possession, she

fortified herself to begin. With occasional interruptions from her

aunt she told the tale as she understood it, taking as point of

departure the evening when Davenant came to dine at Tory Hill, on

his return from his travels round the world.
"So there was a time when you didn't like him," was Madame de

Melcourt's first comment.
"There was a time when I didn't understand him."
"But when you did understand him you changed your mind."
"I couldn't help it."
"And did you change anything more than your—mind?"
There was so much insinuation in the cracked voice that Olivia

colored, in spite of the degree in which she thought herself armed

against all surprises. It was a minute or more before she was

prepared with an answer.
"I changed my attitude toward him. Before that I'd been hostile

and insolent, and then—and then—I grew humble. Yes,

Aunt Vic—humble. I grew more than humble. I came to

feel—well, as you might feel if you'd struck a great St.

Bernard dog who'd been rescuing you in the snow. There's something

about him that makes you think of a St. Bernard—so big and

true and loyal—"
"Did you ever think he might be in love with you?"
She was ready for this question, and had made up her mind to

answer it frankly. "Yes. I was afraid he was advancing the money on

that account. I felt so right up to—to a few days ago."
"And what happened then?"
"Drusilla told me he'd said he—wasn't."
Madame de Melcourt let that pass. "Did you think he'd fallen in

love with you all of a sudden when he came that night to

dinner?"
She resolved to tell the whole truth. "I'd known him before. He

asked me to marry him years ago. And something happened. I hardly

know how to tell you. I didn't answer him."
"Didn't answer him?"
"I got up and walked away, right in the middle of—of what

he was trying to tell me."
"Ti-ens! And you had to take his money after all?"
Olivia bowed her head.
"Ça c'est trop fort," the old lady went on. "You're quite

right then when you say you'll never be able to pay him off, even

if you get rid of him. But he's paid you off, hasn't he?

It's a more beautiful situation than I fancied. He didn't tell me

that."
Olivia looked up. "He didn't tell you? Who?"
"Your papa," the old lady said, promptly. "It's perfectly

lovely, isn't it? I should think when you meet him you must feel

frightfully ashamed. Don't you?"
"I should if there wasn't something about him that—"
"And you'll never get over it," the old lady went on,

pitilessly, "not even after you've married the other man. The

humiliation will haunt you—toujours—toujours! N'est-ce

pas? If it were I, I should want to marry a man I'd done a thing

like that to—just to carry it off. But you can't,

can you? You've got to marry the other man. Even if you

weren't so horribly in love with him, you'd have to marry him, when

he's stood by you like that. I should be ashamed of you if you

didn't."
"Of course, Aunt Vic."
"If he were to back out that would be another thing. But as it

is you've got to swallow your humiliation, with regard to this

Davenant. Or, rather, you can't swallow it. You've simply got to

live on it, so to speak. You'll never be able to forget for an hour

of the day that you treated a man like that—and then took his

money, will you? It isn't exactly like striking a St. Bernard who's

rescuing you in the snow. It's like beating him first and then

having him come and save you afterward. Oh, la la! Quelle

drôle de chose que la vie! Well, it's a good thing we can

return his money, at the least."
"You're so good about that, dear Aunt Vic. I didn't understand I

was to have it when I couldn't see my way to—to—"
"To marry Berteuil. That's all over and done with. I see you

weren't made for life in the real world. Anyhow," she added, taking

a virtuous air, "when my word was passed it was passed. Not that

your dot will do you much good. It'll all have to go to

settle the claims of this Mr.—By the way, where is he? Why

doesn't he come and be paid?"
"He's out in Michigan, at a little place called Stoughton."
"Then send for him."
"I'm not sure we can get him. Cousin Cherry has written to him

three times since he went away, and he doesn't answer."
"Cousin Cherry! What a goose! Who'd ever think she was the

pretty Charlotte Hawke that Rodney Temple fell in love with. What's

the matter with you, over here, that you all grow old at a minute's

notice, so to speak? I never saw such a lot of frumps as the women

who used to be my own contemporaries. Rodney and I were very good

friends once. If I could only have settled down in humdrum old

Waverton—but we'll let bygones be bygones, and send for your

man."
"I'll ask Cousin Cherry to write to him again."
"Stuff, dear. That won't do any good. Wire him yourself, and

tell him I'm here."
"Oh, but, Aunt Vic, dear."
With little perkings of the head and much rolling of the eyes

the Marquise watched the warm color rise in Olivia's cheek and

surge slowly upward to the temples. Madame de Melcourt made signs

of trying to look anywhere and everywhere, up to the ceiling and

down at the floor, rather than be a witness of so much

embarrassment. She emphasized her discretion, too, by making a

great show of seeing nothing in particular, toying with her rings

and bracelets till Olivia had sufficiently recovered to be again

commanded to send for Davenant.
"Tell him I'm here and that I want to have a look at him. Use my

name so that he'll see it's urgent. Then you can sign the telegram

with your own. Cousin Cherry! Stuff!"

Later that day Madame de Melcourt was making a confession to

Rodney Temple.
"Oui, mon bon Rodney. It was love at first sight. The thing

hadn't happened to me for years."
"Had it been in the habit of happening?"
"In the habit of happening—that's too much to say. I may

have had a little toquade from time to time—I don't say

no—of an innocence!—or nearly of an

innocence!—Mais que voulez-vous?—a woman in my

position!—a widow since I was so high!—and exposed to

the most flattering attentions. You know nothing about it over

here. L'amour est l'enfant de Bohème, as the song says, and,

whatever you can say for Waverton and Cambridge and Boston, you'll

admit—"
He leaned back in his rocking-chair with a laugh. "One does the

best one can, Vic. We're children of opportunity as well as enfants

de Bohème. If your chances have been more generous, and I

presume more tempting, than ours, it isn't kind of you to come back

and taunt us."
"Don't talk about tempting, Rodney. You can't imagine how

tiresome those men become—always on the hunt for

money—always trying to find a wife who'll support them

without their having to work. I speak of the good people, of

course. With the bourgeoisie it's different. They work and take

care of their families like other people. Only they don't count. If

I hadn't money—they'd slam the door on me like that." She

indicated the violence of the act by gesture. "As it is, they

smother me. There are three of them at Melcourt-le-Danois at this

present moment—Anne Marie de Melcourt's two boys and one

girl. They're all waiting for me to supply the funds with which

they're to make rich marriages. Is it any wonder that I look upon

what's done for my own niece as so much saved? Henry's getting into

such a hole seemed to me providential—gives me the chance to

snatch something away from them before they—and when it's to

go ultimately to him—"
"The young fellow you've taken such a fancy to?"
"You'd have taken a fancy to him, too, if you'd known only men

who make it a trade to ask all and give next to nothing in return.

You'd be smitten to the core by a man who asks nothing and offers

all, if he were as ugly as a gargoyle. But when he takes the form

of a blond Hercules, with eyes blue as the myosotis, and a

mustache—mais une moustache!—and with no idea whatever

of the bigness of the thing he's doing! It was the thunderbolt,

Rodney—le coup de foudre—and no wonder!"
"I hope you told him so."
"I was very stiff with him. I sent him about his business just

like that." She snapped her fingers. "But I only meant it with

reserves. I let him see how I had been wronged—how cruelly

Olivia had misunderstood me—but I showed him, too, how I

could forgive." She tore at her breast as though to lay bare her

heart. "Oh, I impressed him—not all at once perhaps—but

little by little—"
"As he came to know you."
"I wouldn't let him go away. He stayed at the inn in the village

two weeks and more. It's an old chef of mine who keeps it. And I

learned all his secrets. He thought he was throwing dust in my

eyes, but he didn't throw a grain. As if I couldn't see who was in

love with who—after all my experience! Ah, mon bon Rodney, if

I'd been fifty years younger! And yet if I'd been fifty years

younger, I shouldn't have judged him at his worth. He's the type to

which you can do justice only when you've a standard of comparison,

n'est-ce pas? It's in putting him beside other men—the

best—even Ashley over there—that you see how big he

is."
She tossed her hand in the direction of Ashley and Drusilla,

sitting by the tea-table at the other end of the room. Mrs. Temple

had again found errands of mercy to insure her absence.
"Il est très bien, cet Ashley," the Marquise continued,

"chic—distinguished—no more like a wooden man than any

other Englishman. Il est très bien—but what a

difference!—two natures—the one a mountain pool,

fierce, deep, hemmed in all round—the other the great sea.

Voilà—Ashley et mon Davenant. And he helped me. He

gave me courage to stand up against the Melcourt—to run away

from them. Oh yes, we ran away—almost. I made a pretext for

going to Paris—the old pretext, the dentist. They didn't

suspect at my age—how should they?—or they wouldn't

have let me come alone. Helie or Paul or Anne Marie would have come

with me. Oh, they smother me! But we ran away. We took the train to

Cherbourg, just like two eloping lovers—and the bateau de

luxe, the Louisiana to New York. Mais

hélas!—"
She paused to laugh, and at the same time to dash away a tear.

"At New York we parted, never to meet again—so he thinks. His

work was done! He went straight to that funny place in Michigan to

join his pal. He's there now—waiting to hear that Olivia has

married her Englishman, as you might wait to hear that sentence of

death on some one you were fond of had been carried out. Ah, mon

Dieu, quel brave homme! I'm proud to belong to the people who

produced him. I don't know that I ever was before."
"Oh, the world is full of brave fellows, when the moment comes

to try them."
"Perhaps. I'm not convinced. What about him?" She

flicked her hand again toward Ashley. "Would he stand a big

test?"
"He's stood a good many of them, I understand. He's certainly

been equal to his duty here."
"He's done what a gentleman couldn't help doing. That's

something, but it's possible to ask more."
"I hope you're not going to ask it," he began, in some

anxiety.
"He strikes me as a man who would grant what was wrung from him,

while the other—my blond Hercules—gives royally, like a

king."
"There's a soul that climbs as by a ladder, and there's a soul

that soars naturally as a lark. I don't know that it matters which

they do, so long as they both mount upward."
"We shall see."
"What shall we see? I hope you're not up to anything, Vic?"
With another jerk of her hand in the direction of Ashley and

Drusilla, she said, "That's the match that should have—"
But the old man was out of his seat. "You must excuse me now,

Vic. I've some work to do."
"Yes, be off. Only—"
She put her forefinger on her lips, rolling her eyes under the

brim of her extravagant hat with an expression intended to exclude

from their pact of confidence not only the other two occupants of

the room, but every one else.
Olivia received the reply to her telegram: "Shall arrive in

Boston Wednesday night."
Considering it time to bring the purely financial side of the

situation under discussion, Madame de Melcourt explained to her

niece that she, the Marquise, had nothing to do, in her own person,

with the extraordinary person who was about to arrive. Her part

would be accomplished when once she had handed over the

dot either to Olivia or to her trustees. As the passing of

this sum through Miss Guion's hands was to be no more than a

formality, the question of trustees was not worth taking up. With

the transfer of securities for the amount agreed upon from the one

name to the other—a piece of business which would be carried

out by Davis & Stern—the Marquise considered that she

would have done all for which she could be called upon. Everything

else concerned Olivia and her father and Davenant. Her own interest

in the young man would be satisfied with a glance of curiosity.
The brief conversation to this effect having taken place before

luncheon, Madame de Melcourt pursued other aspects of the subject

with Colonel Ashley when that repast was ended and coffee was being

served to them in the library. Olivia having withdrawn to wait on

her father, Madame de Melcourt bade him light his cigar while she

herself puffed daintily at a cigarette. If she was a little

grotesque in doing it, he had seen more than one elderly

Englishwoman who, in the same pastime, was even more so.
Taking one thing with another, he liked his future great-aunt by

marriage. That is, he liked a connection that would bring him into

touch with such things in the world as he held to be important.

While he had the scorn natural to the Englishman of the Service

class for anything out of England that pretended to be an

aristocracy, he admitted that the old French royalist cause had

claims to distinction. The atmosphere of it clinging to one who was

presumably in the heart of its counsels restored him to that view

of his marriage as an alliance between high contracting powers

which events in Boston had made so lamentably untenable. If he was

disconcerted, it was by her odd way of keeping him at

arm's-length.
"She doesn't like me, what?" he had more than once said to

Olivia, and with some misgiving.
Olivia could only answer: "I think she must. She's said a good

many times that you were chic and distinguished. That's a great

deal for any Englishman from her."
"She acts as if she had something up her sleeve."
That had become something like a conviction with him; but to-day

he flattered himself that he had made some progress in her graces.

His own spirits, too, were so high that he could be affable to

Guion, who appeared at table for the only time since the day of

their first meeting. Hollow-checked, hollow-eyed, his figure

shrunken, and his handsome hand grown so thin that the ring kept

slipping from his finger, Guion essayed, in view of his powerful

relative's vindication—for so he liked to think of

it—to recapture some of his old elegance as a host. To this

Ashley lent himself with entire good-will, taking Guion's timid

claim for recognition as part of the new heaven and the new earth

under process of construction. In this greatly improved universe

Olivia, too, acquired in her lover's eyes a charm, a dignity, a

softened grace beyond anything he had dreamed of. If she seemed

older, graver, sadder perhaps, the change was natural to one who

had passed through trials so sordid and so searching. A month of

marriage, a month of England, would restore all her youth and

freshness.
Nevertheless he was glad to be alone with Madame de Melcourt. It

was the moment he had waited for, the moment of paying some fitting

tribute to her generosity. He had said little of it hitherto, not

wanting, as he put it, "to drag it in by the hair of its head." He

knew an opportunity would arise; and it had arisen.
It was the sort of thing he could have done better had he not

been haunted by the Englishman's fear of being over-demonstrative.

He was easily capable of turning a nice little speech. Apart from

the fear of transgressing the canons of negative good form he would

have enjoyed turning one. As it was, he assumed a stammer and a

drawl, jerking out a few inarticulate phrases of which the lady

could distinguish only "so awfully good of you" and "never forget

your jolly kindness." This being masculine, soldier-like, and

British, he was hurt to notice an amused smile on the Marquise's

lips. He could have sworn that she felt the speech inadequate to

the occasion. She would probably have liked it better had it been

garnished with American flourishes or French ornamentation. "She's

taking me for a jolly ass," he said to himself, and reddened

hotly.
In contrast to his deliberate insufficiency the old lady's thin

voice was silvery and precise. Out of some bit of obscure

wilfulness, roused by his being an Englishman, she accentuated her

Parisian affectations.
"I'm very much delighted, Col-on-el," she said, giving the

military title its three distinct French syllables, "but you must

not think me better than I am. I'm very fond of my niece—and

of her father. After all, they stand nearer to me than any one else

in the world. They're all I've got of my very own. In any case,

they should have had the money some day—when I—that is,

I'd made my will n'est-ce pas? But what matters a little sooner or

a little later? And I want my niece to be happy. I want a great

many things; but when I've sifted them all, I think I want that

more than anything else."
Ashley bowed. "We shall always feel greatly indebted—" he

began, endeavoring to be more elegant than in his words of a few

minutes earlier.
"I want her to be happy, Col-on-el. She deserves it. She's a

noble creature, with a heart of gold and a spirit of iron. And she

loves me, I think."
"I know she does, by Jove!"
"And I can't think of any one else who does love me for myself."

She gave a thin, cackling laugh. "They love my money. Le bon Dieu

has counted me worthy of having a good deal during these later

years. And they're all very fond of it. But she's fond of

me. I was very angry with her once; but now I want her to

be happy with the man—with the man she's in love with. So

when Mr. Davenant came and told me of your noble

character—"
"The devil he did!"
Ashley sprang out of his chair. The cigar dropped from his limp

fingers. In stooping to pick it up he caught the echo of his own

exclamation. "I beg your pardon—" he began, when he had

raised himself. He grew redder than ever; his eyes danced.
"Ça ne fait rien, Col-on-el. It's an expression of which

I myself often use the equivalent—in French. But I don't

wonder you're pleased. Your friend Mr. Davenant made the journey to

Europe purposely to tell me how highly you were qualified as a

suitor for my niece's hand. When one has a friend like

that—"
"But he's not my friend."
"You surprise me, Col-on-el. He spoke of you with so much

praise—so much affection, I might say. He said no one could

be so worthy to marry my niece—no one could make her so

happy—no one could give her such a distinguished position in

the world—no one was so fine a fellow in his own

person—"
He looked mystified. "But he's out there in Michigan—"
She puffed delicately at her cigarette. "He stayed with me two

weeks at Melcourt-le-Danois. That is, he stayed at the inn in the

village. It was the same thing. I was very angry with my niece

before that. It was he who made me see differently. If it were not

for him I shouldn't be here. He traveled to France expressly to beg

my help—how shall I say?—on your behalf—in

simplifying things—so that you and Olivia might be free from

your sense of obligation to him—and might marry—"
"Did he say he was in love with her himself?"
She ignored the hoarse suffering in his voice to take another

puff or two at her cigarette. "Ma foi, Col-on-el, he didn't have

to."
"Did he say—" He swallowed hard, and began again, more

hoarsely: "Did he say she was—in love with—with

him?"
There was a hint of rebuke in her tone. "He's a very loyal

gentleman. He didn't."
"Did he make you think—?"
"What he made me think, Col-on-el, is my own affair."
He jumped to his feet, throwing his cigar violently into the

fire. For a minute or two he stood glaring at the embers. When he

turned on her it was savagely.
"May I ask your motive in springing this on me, Marquise?"
"Mon Dieu, Col-on-el, I thought you'd like to know what a friend

you have."
"Damn his friendship. That's not the reason. You've something up

your sleeve."
She looked up at him innocently. "Have I? Then I must leave it

to you to tell me what it is. But when you do," she added, smiling,

"I hope you'll take another tone. In France men are gallant with

women—"
"And in England women are straight with men. What they have to

say they say. They don't lay snares, or lie in ambush."
She laughed. "Quant à cela, Col-on-el, il y en a pour

tous les goûts, même en Angleterre."
"I'll bid you good-by, madame."
He bowed stiffly, and went out into the hail. She continued to

smoke daintily, pensively, while she listened to him noisily

pulling on his overcoat and taking his stick from the stand. As he

passed the library door he stopped on the threshold.
"By Gad, she's mine!" he said, fiercely.
She got up and went to him, taking him by the lapel of the coat.

There was something like pity in her eyes as she said: "My poor

fellow, nobody has raised that question. What's more, nobody

will raise it—unless you do yourself."

XXIII
A
shley's craving was for space and air. He felt

choked, strangled. There was a high wind blowing, carrying a sleety

rain. It was a physical comfort to turn into the teeth of it.
He took a road straggling out of the town toward the remoter

suburbs, and so into the country. He marched on, his eyes unseeing,

his mouth set grimly—goaded by a kind of frenzy to run away

from that which he knew he could not leave behind. It was like

fleeing from something omnipresent. Though he should turn his back

on it never so sternly and travel never so fast, it would be with

him. It had already entered into his life as a constituent element;

he could no more get rid of it than of his breath or his blood.
And yet the thing itself eluded him. In the very attempt to

apprehend it by sight or name, he found it mysteriously beyond his

grasp. It was like an enemy in the air, deadly but out of reach. It

had struck him, though he could not as yet tell where. He could

only stride onward through the wind and rain, as a man who has been

shot can ride on till he falls.
So he tramped for an hour or more, finding himself at last amid

bleak, dreary marshes, over which the November twilight was coming

down. He felt lonely, desolate, far from his familiar things, far

from home. His familiar things were his ambitions, as home was that

life of well-ordered English dignity, in which to-morrow will bear

some relation to to-day.
He felt used up by the succession of American shocks, of

American violences. They had reduced him to a condition of

bewilderment. For four or five weeks he had scarcely known from

minute to minute where he stood. He had maintained his ground as

best he was able, holding out for the moment when he could marry

his wife and go his way; and now, when ostensibly the hour had come

in which to do it, it was only that he might see confusion worse

confounded.
He turned back toward the town. He did so with a feeling of

futility in the act. Where should he go? What should he do? How was

he to deal with this new, extraordinary feature in the case? It was

impossible to return to Tory Hill, as if the Marquise had told him

nothing, and equally impossible to make what she had said a point

of departure for anything else. If he made it a point of departure

for anything at all, it could only be for a step which his whole

being rebelled against taking.
It was a solution of the instant's difficulties to avoid the

turning to Tory Hill and go on to Drusilla Fane's. In the wind and

rain and gathering darkness the thought of her fireside was

cheering. She would understand him, too. She had always understood

him. It was her knowledge of the English point of view that made

her such an efficient pal. During all the trying four or five weeks

through which he had passed she had been able to give him

sympathetic support just where and when he needed it. It was

something to know she would give it to him again.
As he told her of Davenant's journey to France he could see her

eyes grow bigger and blacker than ever in the flickering firelight.

She kept them on him all the while he talked. She kept them on him

as from time to time she lifted her cup and sipped her tea.
"Then that's why he didn't answer mother's letters," she said,

absently, when he had finished. "He wasn't there."
"He wasn't there, by Jove! And don't you see what a fix he's put

me in?"
She replied, still absently: "I'm not sure that I do."
"He's given away the whole show to me. The question is now

whether I can take it, what?"
"He hasn't given away anything you didn't have before."
"He's given away something he might perhaps have had

himself."
She drew back into the shadow so that he might not see her

coloring. She had only voice enough to say: "What makes you think

so?"
"Don't you think so?"
"That's not a fair question."
"It's a vital one."
"To you—yes. But—"
"But not to you. Oh, I understand that well enough. But you've

been such a good pal that I thought you might help me to

see—"
"I'm afraid I can't help you to see anything. If I were to try I

might mislead you."
"But you must know, by Jove! Two women can't be such

pals as Olivia and you—"
"If I did know I shouldn't tell you. It's something you should

find out for yourself."
"Find out! I've asked her."
"Well, if she's told you, isn't that enough?"
"It would be enough in England. But here, where words don't seem

to have the same meaning as they do anywhere else—and

surprises are sprung on you—and people have queer,

complicated motives—and do preposterous, unexpected

things—"
"Peter's going to see old Cousin Vic might be unexpected; but I

don't think you can call it preposterous."
"It's preposterous to have another man racing about the world

trying to do you good, by Jove!"
"He wasn't trying to do you good so much as not to do you harm.

He thought he'd done that, apparently, by interfering with Cousin

Henry's affairs in the first place. His asking the old Marquise to

come to the rescue was only an attempt to make things easier for

you."
He sprang to his feet. "And he's got me where I must either call

his bluff or—or—or accept his beastly sacrifice."
He tugged fiercely, first at one end, then at the other, of the

bristling, horizontal mustache. Drusilla tried to speak calmly.
"He's not making a sacrifice if there was nothing for him to

give up."
"That's what I must find out."
She considered it only loyal to say: "It's well to remember that

in making the attempt you may do more harm than good. 'Where the

apple reddens, never pry, lest we lose our Edens'—You know

the warning."
"Yes, I know. That's Browning. In other words, it means, let

well enough alone."
"Which isn't bad advice, you know."
"Which isn't bad advice—except in love. Love won't put up

with reserves. It must have all—or it will take nothing."
He dropped into a low chair at the corner of the hearth.

Wielding the poker in both hands, he knocked sparks idly from a

smoldering log. It was some minutes before she ventured to say:
"And suppose you discovered that you couldn't get

all?"
"I've thought that out. I should go home, and ask to be allowed

to join the first punitive expedition sent out—one of those

jolly little parties from which they don't expect more than half

the number to come back. There's one just starting

now—against the Carrals—up on the Tibet frontier. I

dare say I could catch it."
Again some minutes went by before she said: "Is it as bad as all

that?"
"It's as bad as all that."
She got up because she could no longer sit still. His pain was

almost more than she could bear. At the moment she would have given

life just to be allowed to lay her hand soothingly on his shoulder

or to stroke his bowed head. As it was, she could barely give

herself the privilege of taking one step toward him, and even in

doing this she was compelled to keep behind him, lest she should

betray herself in the approach.
"Couldn't I—?"
The offer of help was in the tone, in its timid beseeching.
He understood it, and shook his head without looking up.
"No," he said, briefly. "No. No one can."
She remained standing behind him, because she hadn't the

strength to go away. He continued to knock sparks from the log.

Repulsed from the sphere of his suffering, she was thrown back on

her own. She wondered how long she should stand there, how long he

would sit, bending like that, over the dying fire. It was the most

intolerable minute of her life, and yet he didn't know it. Just for

the instant she resented that—that while he could get the

relief of openness and speech, she must be condemned forever to

shame and silence. If she could have thrown herself on her knees

beside him and flung her arms about his neck, crying, "I love you;

I love you! Whoever doesn't—I do!—I

do!" she would have felt that life had reached fruition.
The minutes became more unendurable. In sheer self-defense she

was obliged to move, to say something, to break the tensity of the

strain. One step—the single step by which she had dared to

draw nearer him, stretching out yearning hands toward him—one

step sufficed to take her back to the world of conventionalities

and commonplaces, where the heart's aching is taboo.
She must say something, no matter what, and the words that came

were: "Won't you have another cup of tea?"
He shook his head, still without looking up. "Thanks; no."
But she was back again on her own ground, back from the land of

enchantment and anguish. It was like returning to an empty home

after a journey of poignant romance. She was mistress of herself

again, mistress of her secret and her loneliness. She could command

her voice, too. She could hear herself saying, as if some one else

were speaking from the other side of the room:
"It seems to me you take it too tragically to begin

with—"
"It isn't to begin with. I saw there was a screw loose from the

first. And since then some one has told me that she was—half

in love with him, by Jove!—as it was."
She remained standing beside the tea-table. "That must have been

Cousin Henry. He'd have a motive in thinking so—not so much

to deceive you as to deceive himself. But if it's any comfort to

you to know it, I've talked to them both. I suppose they spoke to

me confidentially, and I haven't felt justified in betraying them.

But rather than see you suffer—"
He put the poker in its place among the fire-irons and swung

round in his chair toward her. "Oh, I say! It isn't suffering, you

know. That is, it isn't—"
She smiled feebly. "Oh, I know what it is. You don't have to

explain. But I'll tell you. I asked Peter—or practically

asked him—some time ago—if he was in love with

her—and he said he wasn't."
His face brightened. "Did he, by Jove?"
"And when I told her that—the other day—she

said—"
"Yes? Yes? She said—?"
"She didn't put it in so many words—but she gave me to

understand—or tried to give me to

understand—that it was a relief to her—because, in that

case, she wasn't obliged to have him on her mind. A woman

has those things on her mind, you know, about one man when

she loves another."
He jumped up. "I say! You're a good pal. I shall never forget

it."
He came toward her, but she stepped back at his approach. She

was more sure of herself in the shadow.
"Oh, it's nothing—"
"You see," he tried to explain, "it's this way with me. I've

made it a rule in my life to do—well, a little more than the

right thing—to do the high thing, if you understand—and

that fellow has a way of getting so damnably on top. I can't allow

it, you know. I told you so the other day."
"You mean, if he does something fine, you must do something

finer."
He winced at this. "I can't go on swallowing his beastly favors,

don't you see? And hang it all! if he is—if he is

my—my rival—he must have a show."
"And how are you going to give him a show if he won't take

it?"
He started to pace up and down the room. "That's your beastly

America, where everything goes by freaks—where everything is

queer and inconsequent and tortuous, and you can't pin any one

down."
"It seems to me, on the contrary, that you have every one pinned

down. You've got everything your own way, and yet you aren't

satisfied. Peter has taken himself off; old Cousin Vic has paid the

debts; and Olivia is ready to go to church and marry you on the

first convenient day. What more can you ask?"
"That's what she said, by Jove!—the old Marquise.

She said the question would never be raised unless I raised

it."
Drusilla tried to laugh. "Eh, bien? as she'd say herself."
He paused in front of her. "Eh, bien, there is something else;

and," he added, tapping his forehead sharply, "I'll be hanged if I

know what it is."
She was about to say something more when the sound of the

shutting of the street door stopped her. There was much puffing and

stamping, with shouts for Jane to come and take an umbrella.
"I say, that's your governor. I'll go and talk to him."
He went without another look at her. She steadied herself with

the tips of her fingers on the tea-table, in order not to swoon.

She knew she wouldn't swoon; she only felt like it, or like dying.

But all she could do was limply to pour herself out an extra cup of

tea and drink it.

In the library Ashley was taking heart of grace. He had come to

ask advice, but he was really pointing out the things that were in

his favor. He repeated Drusilla's summing-up of them almost word

for word.
"You see, as far as that goes, I've everything my own way. No

question will be raised unless I raise it. The fellow has taken

himself off; the Marquise has most generally assumed the family

liabilities; and Olivia is ready to come to church with me and be

married on the first convenient day. I should be satisfied with

that, now shouldn't I?"
The old man nodded. "Your difficulties do seem to have been

smoothed out."
He sat, fitting the tips of his fingers together and swinging

his leg, in his desk-chair. The light of the green-shaded desk-lamp

alone lit up the room. In the semi-obscurity porcelains and

potteries gleamed like crystals in a cave. Ashley paced the floor,

emerging from minute to minute out of the gloom into the radiance

of the lamp.
"I'm not called on to go poking behind things to see what's

there, now am I?"
"Not in the least."
"I'm willing to consider every one, and I think I do. But there

are limits, by Jove! Now, really?"
"The minute we recognize limits it's our duty not to go beyond

them. It's thus far and no farther—for the man who knows the

stretch of his tether, at any rate. The trouble with Peter is that

his tether is elastic. It'll spin out as far as he sees the need to

go. For the rest of us there are limits, as you say; but about him

there's something—something you might call limitless."
Ashley rounded sharply. "You mean he's so big that no one can be

bigger."
"Not exactly. I mean that very few of us need to be as

big as that. It's all very well for him; but most of us have to

keep within the measure of our own capacity."
"And sit down under him, while he looms up into God knows

where?"
"Well, wouldn't that be your idea?"
"Can't say that it is. My idea is that when I take my rights and

keep them, I'm as big as any one."
"Quite so; as big as any one—who takes his rights and

keeps them. That's very true."
Ashley stopped, one hand behind him, the other supporting him as

he leaned on the desk. "And that's what I propose to do," he said,

aggressively.
"It's a very high ideal."
"I propose to accept the status quo without asking any more

questions."
"I should think that would be a very good plan. A wise

man—one of the wisest—wrote, apropos of well-disposed

people who were seeking a standard of conduct: 'Happy is he that

condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.' I should

think you'd have every reason for that kind of self-approval."
"Do you mean that, sir? or are you—trying it on?"
"I'm certainly not trying it on. The man who takes his rights

and keeps them can be amply justified. If there's a counsel of

perfection that goes beyond that standard—well, it isn't

given to all men to receive it."
"Then you think it isn't given to me. You'd put me down as a

good sort of chap who comes in second best."
"What makes you think I should do that?"
"Because—because—hang it all! If I let this fellow

keep ahead of me—why, I should come in second

best."
"You say keep ahead of me. Do you think he's ahead of

you now?"
Ashley straightened himself. He looked uncomfortable. "He's got

a pull, by Jove! He made that journey to France—and cracked

me up to the Marquise—and wheedled her round—when all

the while he must have known that he was hammering nails into his

own coffin. He did it, too, after I'd insulted him and we'd had a

row."
"Oh, that's nothing. To a fellow like him that sort of thing

comes easy."
"It wouldn't come easy to me, by Jove!"
"Then it would be all the more to your credit, if you ever did

anything of the kind."
The Englishman bounded away. Once more he began to pace the

floor restlessly. The old man took his pipe from a tray, and his

tobacco-pouch from a drawer. Having filled the bowl, with

meditative leisure he looked round for a match. "Got a light?"
Ashley struck a vesta on the edge of his match-box and applied

it to the old man's pipe.
"Should you say," he asked, while doing it, "that I ought to

attempt anything in that line?"
"Certainly not—unless you want to—to get ahead."
"I don't want to stay behind."
"Then, it's for you to judge, my son."
There was something like an affectionate stress on the two

concluding monosyllables. Ashley backed off, out of the

lamplight.
"It's this way," he explained, stammeringly; "I'm a British

officer and gentleman. I'm a little more than that—since I'm

a V.C. man—and a fellow—dash it all, I might as well

say it!—I'm a fellow they've got their eye on—in the

line of high office, don't you know? And I can't—I simply

can't—let a chap like that make me a present of all

his chances—"
"Did he have any?"
Ashley hesitated. "Before God, sir, I don't know—but I'm

inclined to think—he had. If so, I suppose they're of as much

value to him as mine to me."
"But not of any more."
He hesitated again. "I don't know about that. Perhaps they are.

The Lord knows I don't say that lightly, for mine are—Well,

we needn't go into that. But I've got a good deal in my life, and I

don't imagine that he, poor devil—"
"Oh, don't worry. A rich soil is never barren. When nothing is

planted in it, Nature uses it for flowers."
Ashley answered restively. "I see, sir, your sympathies are all

on his side."
"Not at all. Quite the contrary. My certainties are on his side.

My sympathies are on yours."
"Because you think I need them."
"Because I think you may."
"In case I—"
"In case you should condemn yourself in the thing you're going

to allow."
"But what's it to be?"
"That's for you to settle with yourself."
He was silent a minute. When he spoke it was with some

conviction. "I should like to do the right thing, by

Jove!—the straight thing—if I only knew what it

was."
"Oh, there'll be no trouble about that. In the Street called

Straight, my son, there are lights to show the way."

"Rum old cove," was Ashley's comment to himself as he went back

to Boston. "Got an answer to everything."
From the hotel he telephoned an excuse to Olivia for his

unceremonious departure from Tory Hill. "Had an upset," was the

phrase by which he conveyed his apologies, leaving it to her to

guess the nature of his mischance. As she showed no curiosity on

the point, he merely promised to come to luncheon in the

morning.
During his dinner he set himself to think, though, amid the

kaleidoscopic movement of the hotel dining-room, he got little

beyond the stage of "mulling." Such symptoms of decision as showed

themselves through the evening lay in his looking up the dates of

sailing of the more important liners, and the situation of the

Carral country on the map. He missed, however, the support of his

principle to be Rupert Ashley at his best. That guiding motto

seemed to have lost its force owing to the eccentricities of

American methods of procedure. If he was still Rupert Ashley, he

was Rupert Ashley sadly knocked about, buffeted, puzzled, grown

incapable of the swift judgment and prompt action which had

hitherto been his leading characteristics.
He was still beset by uncertainties when he went out to Waverton

next morning. Impatient for some form of action, he made an early

start. On the way he considered Rodney Temple's words of the

previous afternoon, saying to himself: "In the Street called

Straight there are lights to show the way, by Jove! Gad! I should

like to know where they are."
ASHLEY GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THEIR CONVERSATION WAS EARNEST, CONFIDENTIAL.

ASHLEY GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT THEIR

CONVERSATION WAS EARNEST, CONFIDENTIAL.

Nevertheless, it had a clarifying effect on his vision to find,

on walking into the drawing-room at Tory Hill, Miss Guion seated in

conversation with Peter Davenant. As he had the advantage of seeing

them a second before they noticed him, he got the impression that

their conversation was earnest, confidential. Olivia was seated in

a corner of the sofa, Davenant in a low chair that gave him the

appearance of being at her feet.
It was exactly the stimulus Ashley needed to bring his faculties

into action. He was at once in possession of all his powers. The

feeling inspired by the sight of them together transformed him on

the instant into the quick, shrewd, diplomatic officer in whom he

recognized himself. It was a feeling too complicated to be called

jealousy, though jealousy might have been in it as an ingredient

pang. If so, it was entirely subordinate to his new sense—or

rather his old sense—of being equal to the occasion. As he

crossed the room he felt no misgiving, no hesitation. Neither did

he need to forecast, however rapidly, his plan of speech or action,

since he knew that in urgent cases it was always given him. If he

had to define this sudden confidence he might have said that Rupert

Ashley at his best had been restored to life again, but even that

would not have expressed the fullness of his consciousness of

power.
He nodded to Davenant before shaking hands with Miss Guion.

"Hello! Back again?"
Davenant got up from his low chair with some embarrassment.

Ashley bowed over Olivia's hand with unusual courtliness. He seated

himself in the other corner of the sofa, as one who had a right to

the place.
"I had to come East on business," Davenant explained, at

once.
Olivia hastened to corroborate this statement. "Aunt Vic wanted

Mr. Davenant to come—to settle up all the things—"
"And I had another reason," Davenant interrupted, nervously. "I

was just beginning to tell Miss Guion about it when you came in.

I've a job out there—in my work—that would suit Mr.

Guion. It would be quite in his line—legal adviser to a

company—and would give him occupation. He'd be earning money,

and wouldn't feel laid aside; and if he was ill I could look after

him as well as any one. I—I'd like it."
Olivia looked inquiringly at Ashley. Her eyes were misty.
"Hadn't you better talk to him about it?" Ashley

said.
"I thought I'd better speak to you and Miss Guion first. I

understand you've offered to—to take him—"
"I shouldn't interfere with what suited him better, in any case.

By the way, how did you like the Louisiana?"
Davenant's jaw dropped. His blue eyes were wide with amazement.

It was Olivia who undertook to speak, with a little air of surprise

that Ashley should make such an odd mistake.
"Mr. Davenant wasn't on the Louisiana. It was Aunt Vic.

Mr. Davenant has just come from the West. You do that by

train."
"Of course he was on the Louisiana. Landed on

the—let me see!—she sailed again

yesterday!—landed on the 20th, didn't you?"
"No, no," Olivia corrected again, smiling. "That was the day

Aunt Vic landed. You're getting every one mixed."
"But they came together," Ashley persisted. "He brought her.

Didn't you?"
The look on Olivia's face frightened Davenant. He got up and

stood apologetically behind his chair. "You'll have to forgive me,

Miss Guion," he stammered. "I—I deceived you. I couldn't

think of anything else to do."
She leaned forward, looking up at him. "But I don't know what

you did, as it is. I can't understand—what—what any one

is saying."
"Then I'll tell you, by Jove! All the time you thought he was

out there at Michigan he was over in France, following up the

Marquise. Tracked her like a bloodhound, what? Told her the whole

story—how we'd got to a deadlock—and everything. Made

her think that unless she came and bailed us out we'd be caught

there for the rest of our lives."
Olivia's eyes were still lifted to Davenant's. "Is that

true?"
"It's true, by Jove!—true as you live. What's more, he

cracked me up as though I was the only man alive—said that

when it came to a question of who was worthy—worthy to marry

you—he wasn't fit to black my boots."
"No," Davenant cried, fiercely. "There was no question of

me."
"Bosh! Bosh, my good fellow! When a man does what you've done

there's no question of any one but him."
The color was hot in Davenant's cheeks, but he himself could not

have told whether it came from astonishment or anger. "Since

Colonel Ashley knows so well what happened, I shall leave him to

tell it."
He was about to make his escape, when Olivia stopped him. "No,

no. Wait—please wait. Tell me why you did it."
"I'll tell you," Ashley broke in. He spoke with a kind of

nervous jauntiness. "I'll tell you, by Jove! We had a row. I called

him a cad. I called him a damned cad. There was a damned

cad present on that occasion—only—I didn't hit the

right nail on the head. But that's not what I'm coming to. He

struck me. He struck me right in the teeth, by Jove! And when a man

strikes you, it's an insult that can only be wiped out by blood.

Very well; he's offered it—his blood. He didn't wait for me

to draw it. I suppose he thought I wouldn't go in for the heroic.

So of his own accord he went over there to France and shed his

heart's blood, in the hope that I might overlook his offence. All

right, old chap; I overlook it."
With a laugh Ashley held his hand up toward Davenant, who

ignored it.
"Miss Guion," Davenant said, huskily, "Colonel Ashley is pleased

to put his own interpretation on what was in itself a very simple

thing. You mayn't think it a very creditable thing, but I'll tell

you just what happened, and you can draw your own conclusions. I

went over to France, and saw your aunt, the Marquise, and asked her

to let me have my money back. That's the plain truth of it. She'll

tell you so herself. I'd heard she was very fond of

you—devoted to you—and that she was very rich and

generous—and so I thought, if I told her exactly how matters

stood, it would be a good chance to—to—recoup myself

for—the loan."
Ashley sprang up with another laugh. "He does that well, doesn't

he?" he said to Olivia. "Come along, old boy," he added, slipping

his arm through Davenant's. "If I let you stay here you'll perjure

your very soul."
Davenant allowed himself to be escorted to the door. Over his

shoulder Ashley called back to Olivia: "Fellows are never good

friends till after they've had a fight."

XXIV
W
hen Ashley, after pushing Davenant gently out

into the hall, returned to Olivia, she was standing by the

mantelpiece, where the five K'ang-hsi vases had been restored to

their place in honor of the Marquise.
"Rum chap, isn't he?" Ashley observed. "So awfully queer and

American. No Englishman would ever have taken a jaunt like

that—after the old lady—on another chap's behalf. It

wouldn't go down, you know."
Olivia, leaning on the mantelpiece, with face partially turned

from him, made no reply.
He allowed some minutes to pass before saying: "When I asked him

how he liked the Louisiana I wanted to know. I'm thinking

of taking her on her next trip home."
She turned slightly, lifting her eyes. There was a wonderful

light in them, and yet a light that seemed to shine from afar.

"Wouldn't that be rather soon?"
"It would give me time for all I want. Now that I'm here I'd

better take a look at New York and Washington, and perhaps get a

glimpse of your South. I could do that in three weeks."
She seemed to have some difficulty in getting her mind to follow

his words. "I don't think I understand you."
There was a smile on his lips as he said: "Don't you infer

anything?"
"If I inferred anything, it would be that you think of

going home—alone."
"Well, that's it."
She turned fully round. For a long minute they stood staring at

each other. Time and experience seemed both to pass over them

before she uttered the one word: "Why?"
"Isn't it pretty nearly—self-evident?"
She shook her head. "Not to me."
"I'm surprised at that. I thought you would have seen how well

we'd played our game, and that it's—up."
"I don't see—not unless you're trying to tell me that

you've—that your feelings have undergone a—"
He was still smiling rather mechanically, though he tugged

nervously at the end of his horizontal mustache. "Wouldn't it be

possible—now that everything has turned out so—so

beautifully—wouldn't it be possible to let the rest go

without—without superfluous explanations?"
"I'm ready to do everything you like; but I can't help being

surprised."
"That must be because I've been more successful than I thought I

was. I fancied that—when I saw how things were with

you—you saw how they were with me—and that—"
"Saw how they were with you? Do you mean?—No, you can't

mean!—it isn't—Drusilla?"
Since Drusilla would do as well as another, he still stood

smiling. She clasped her hands. Her face was all aglow.
"Oh, I should be so glad! It's only within a few days that I've

seen—how it was—with—"
He hastened to interrupt her, though he had no idea of what she

was going to say. "Then so long as you do see—"
"Oh yes; I—I begin to see. I'm afraid I've been very

stupid. You've been so kind—so noble—when all the

while—"
"We won't discuss that, what? We won't discuss each other at

all. Even if you go your way and I go mine, we shall still

be—"
He didn't finish, because she dropped again to the sofa, burying

her face in the cushions. It was the first time he had ever seen

her give way to deep emotion. If he had not felt so strong to carry

the thing through to the end, he would have been unnerved. As it

was, he sat down beside her, bending over her bowed head. He made

no attempt to touch her.
"I can't bear it," he could hear her panting. "I can't bear

it."
"What is it that you can't bear? The pain?" She nodded without

raising her head.
"Or the happiness?" he asked, gently. She nodded again.
"That is," he went on, "pain for me—and happiness

about—about—the other chap."
She made the same mute sign of affirmation.
"Then, perhaps, that's just as it should be."

When Ashley got out to the road Davenant was still standing by

the gate, uncertain whether to turn back to the house or go away.

Ashley continued to smile jauntily. If he was white about the

temples and sallow in the cheeks there was no one to notice it.
"Miss Guion wants to see you," he announced to Davenant. "It's

about that matter of her father. I dare say you'll pull it off. No,

not just now," he added, as Davenant started to go up the driveway.

"She—she's busy. Later will do. Say this afternoon. Come

along with me. I've got something to tell you. I'm on my way to the

Temples'."
Once more Ashley slipped his arm through Davenant's, but they

walked on in silence. The silence continued till they were on the

Embankment, when Ashley said: "On second thoughts, I sha'n't tell

you what I was going to just now."
"That's all right," Davenant rejoined; and no more was said till

they reached Rodney Temple's door.
"Good-by." Ashley offered his hand. "Good-by. You're a

first-rate sort. You deserve everything you're—you're coming

in for."
Davenant could only wring the proffered hand wonderingly and

continue on his way.
Inside the house Ashley asked only for Drusilla. When she came

to the drawing-room he refused to sit down. He explained his hurry,

on the ground that he was on his way to Boston to take the earliest

possible train for New York.
"Oh yes. That's it," he said, in answer to her dumb looks of

inquiry. "It couldn't go on, you see. You must have known

it—in spite of what you told me last night. You've been an

out-and-out good pal. You've cheered me up more than a bit all the

time I've been here. If it hadn't been for you—Oh yes, I'm

hit; but not hit so hard that I can't still go on

fighting—"
"Not in the Carral country, I hope."
"N-no. On second thoughts that would be only running away. I'm

not going to run away. Wounds as bad as mine have healed with a bit

of nursing, and—Well, good-by. Say good-by to your father and

mother for me, will you?—especially to your governor. Rum old

chap, but sound—sound as—as Shakespeare and the Bible.

Good-by once more. Meet again some time."
It was at the door, to which she accompanied him, that he said:

"By the way, when are you coming home?"
She called all her dignity to her aid in order to reply lightly:

"Oh, I don't know. Not for ages and ages. Perhaps not at all. I may

stay permanently over here. I don't know."
"Oh, I say—"
"In any case I'm here for the winter."
"Oh, but I say, by Jove! That's forever. You'll be back before

spring?"
She weakened in spite of herself. "I couldn't possibly leave

till after Christmas."
"Christmas! It's the end of November now. Well, that's not so

bad. Expect to be in Southsea some time early in the new year. See

you then."
He had gone down the steps when he turned again. Drusilla was

still standing in the open doorway.
"It's awfully queer, but I feel as if—you'll laugh, I

know—but I feel as if I'd been kept from the commission of a

crime. Funny, isn't it? Well, I'll be off. See you in Southsea not

later than the middle of January. Good-by again; and don't forget

my message to your governor."

XXV
I
t was late in the afternoon when Davenant

reappeared at Tory Hill, having tramped the streets during most of

the time since leaving Ashley in the morning. He was nervous. He

was even alarmed. He had little clue to Olivia's judgment on his

visit to the Marquise, and he found Ashley's hints mysterious.
It was reassuring, therefore, to have her welcome him with

gentle cordiality into the little oval sitting-room, where he found

her at her desk. She made him take the most comfortable seat, while

she herself turned partially round, her arm stretched along the

back of her chair. Though the room was growing dim, there was still

a crimson light from the sunset.
He plunged at once into the subject that had brought him,

explaining the nature of the work her father would be called upon

to do. It would be easy work, though real work, just what would be

within his powers. There would be difficulties, some arising from

the relationship of the Massachusetts bar to that of Michigan, and

others on which he touched more lightly; but he thought they could

all be overcome. Even if that proved to be impossible, there were

other things he knew of that Mr. Guion could do—things quite

in keeping with his dignity.
"I've already talked to papa about it," she said. "He's very

grateful—very much touched."
"There's no reason for that. I should like his company.

I'm—I'm fond of him."
For a few minutes she seemed to be pondering, absently. "There's

something I should like to ask you," she said, at last.
"Yes, Miss Guion? What is it?"
"When people have done so much harm as—as we've done, do

you think it's right that they should get off

scot-free—without punishment?"
"I don't know anything about that, Miss Guion. It seems to me

I'm not called upon to know. Where we see things going crooked we

must butt in and help to straighten them. Even when we've done that

to the best of our powers, I guess there'll still be punishment

enough to go round. Outside the law-courts, that's something we

don't have to look after."
Again she sat silent, watching the shifting splendor of the

sunset. He could see her profile set against the deep-red glow like

an intaglio on sard.
"I wonder," she said, "if you have any idea of the many things

you've taught me?"
"I?" He almost jumped from his seat. "You're laughing at

me."
"You've taught me," she went on, quietly, "how hard and narrow

my character has been. You've taught me how foolish a thing pride

can be, and how unlovely we can make even that noble thing we call

a spirit of independence. You've taught me how big human nature

is—how vast and deep and—and good. I don't

think I believed in it before. I know I didn't. I thought it was

the right thing, the clever thing, to distrust it, to discredit it.

I did that. It was because, until I knew you—that is, until I

knew you as you are—I had no conception of

it—not any more than a peasant who's always starved on

barren, inland hills has a conception of the sea."
He was uncomfortable. He was afraid. If she continued to speak

like that he might say something difficult to withdraw. He fell

back awkwardly on the subject of her father and the job at

Stoughton.
"And you won't have to worry about him, Miss Guion, when you're

over there in England," he said, earnestly, as he summed up the

advantages he had to offer, "because if he's ill, I'll look after

him, and if he's very ill, I'll cable. I promise you I

will—on my solemn word."
"You won't have to do that," she said, simply, "because I'm

going, too."
Again he almost jumped from his chair. "Going, too? Going

where?"
"Going to Stoughton with papa."
"But—but—Miss Guion—"
"I'm not going to be married," she continued, in the same even

tone. "I thought perhaps Colonel Ashley might have told you. That's

all over."
"All over—how?"
"He's been so magnificent—so wonderful. He stood by me

during all my trouble, never letting me know that he'd changed in

any way—"
"Oh, he's changed, has he?"
Because he sat slightly behind her, she missed the thunderous

gloom in his face, while she was too intent on what she was saying

to note the significance in his tone.
"Perhaps he hasn't changed so much, after all. As I think it

over I'm inclined to believe that he was in love with Drusilla from

the first-only my coming to Southsea brought in a

disturbing—"
"Then he's a hound! I'd begun to think better of him—I did

think better of him—but now, by God, I'll—"
With a backward gesture of the hand, without looking at him, she

made him resume the seat from which he was again about to

spring.
"No, no. You don't understand. He's been superb. He's still

superb. He would never have told me at all if he hadn't

seen—"
She stopped with a little gasp.
"Yes? If he hadn't seen—what?"
"That I—that I—I care—for some one else."
"Oh! Well, of course, that does make a difference."
He fell back into the depths of his chair, his fingers drumming

on the table beside which he sat. Minutes passed before he spoke

again. He got the words out jerkily, huskily, with dry throat.
"Some one—in England?"
"No—here."
During the next few minutes of silence he pulled himself

imperceptibly forward, till his elbows rested on his knees, while

he peered up into the face of which he could still see nothing but

the profile.
"Is he—is he—coming to Stoughton?"
"He's going to Stoughton. He's been

there—already."
If there was silence again it was because he dared not frame the

words that were on his tongue.
"It isn't—it can't be—?"
Without moving otherwise, she turned her head so that her eyes

looked into his obliquely. She nodded. She could utter no more than

the briefest syllables. "Yes. It is."
His lips were parched, but he still forced himself to speak. "Is

that true?—or are you saying it because—because I put

up the money?"
She gathered all her strength together. "If you hadn't put up

the money, I might never have known that it was true; but it

is true. I think it was true before that—long

ago—when you offered me so much—so

much!—that I didn't know how to take it—and I

didn't answer you. I can't tell. I can't tell when it

began—but it seems to me very far back—"
Still bending forward, he covered his eyes with his left hand,

raising his right in a blind, groping movement in her direction.

She took it in both her own, clasping it to her breast, as she went

on:
"I see now—yes, I think I see quite clearly—that

that's why I struggled against your help, in the first place.... If

it had been anybody else I should probably have taken it at

once.... You must have thought me very foolish.... I suppose I

was.... My only excuse is that it was something like—like

revolt—first against the wrong we had been doing, and then

against the great, sublime thing that was coming up out of the

darkness to conquer me.... That's the way I felt.... I was

afraid.... I wanted something smaller—something more

conventional—such as I'd been trained for.... It was only by

degrees that I came to see that there were big things to live

for—as well as little.... It's all so wonderful!—so

mysterious! I can't tell!... I only know that now—"
He withdrew his hand, looking troubled.
"Are you—are you—sure?"
She reflected a minute. "I know what makes you ask that. You

think I've changed too suddenly. If so, I can explain it."
The silence in which he waited for her to continue assented in

some sort to this reading of his thoughts.
"It isn't that I've changed," she said, at last, speaking

thoughtfully, "so much as that I've wakened to a sense of what's

real for me as distinguished from what's been forced and

artificial. You may understand me better if I say that in leading

my life up to—up to recently, I've been like a person at a

play—a play in which the situations are interesting and the

characters sympathetic, but which becomes like a dream the minute

you leave the theater and go home. I feel that—that with

you—I've—I've got home."
He would have said something, but she hurried on.
"I've not changed toward the play, except to recognize the fact

that it was a play—for me. I knew it the instant I

began to learn about papa's troubles. That was like a summons to

me, like a call. When it came, everything else—the things I'd

been taught to strive for and the people whom I had supposed to be

the only ones worth living with, grew distant and shadowy, as

though they belonged to a picture or a book. It seemed to me that I

woke then for the first time to a realization of the life going on

about me here in my own country, and to a sense of my share in it.

If I hadn't involved myself so much—and involved some one

else with me—my duty would have been clearer from the start.

But Colonel Ashley's been so noble!—he's understood me so

well!—he's helped me so much to understand myself!—that

I can't help honoring him, honoring him with my whole heart, even

if I see now that I don't—that I never did—care for him

in the way—"
She pressed her handkerchief to her lips to keep back what might

have become a sob.
"Did you know I—I loved you?" he asked, still speaking

hoarsely.
"I thought you must," she said, simply. "I used to say I hoped

you didn't—but deep down in my heart—"
He got up and strode to the window, where, with his back to her,

he stared awhile at the last cold glimmer of the sun set. His big

frame and broad shoulders shut out the light to such an extent that

when he turned it was toward a darkened room. He could barely see

her, as she sat sidewise to the desk, an arm along the back of her

chair. His attitude bespoke a doubt in his mind that still kept him

at a distance.
"You're not—you're not—saying all this," he

pleaded, "because you think I've done anything that calls for a

reward? I said once that I should never take anything from you, and

I never shall—unless it's something you give only because you

can't help it."
Her answer was quite prompt. "I'm not giving anything—or

doing anything. What has happened seems to me to have come about

simply and naturally, like the sunrise or the seasons, because it's

the fullness of time and what God means. I can't say more about it

than that. If it depended on my own volition I shouldn't be able to

speak of it so frankly. But now—if you want me—as you

wanted me once—"
She rose and stood by her chair, holding herself proudly and yet

with a certain meekness. With his hands clasped behind him, as

though even yet he dared not touch her, he crossed the twilit room

toward her.

Late that night Henry Guion stood on the terrace below the

Corinthian-columned portico. There was no moon, but the stars had

the gold fire with which they shine when the sky is violet. Above

the horizon a shimmering halo marked the cluster of cities and

towns. In the immediate foreground the great elm was leafless now,

but for that reason more clearly etched against the

starlight—line on line, curve on curve, sweeping, drooping,

interlaced. Guion stood with head up and figure erect, as if from

strength given back to him. Even through the darkness he displayed

some of the self-assurance and stoutness of heart of the man with

whom things are going well. He was

remembering—questioning—doubting.
"I had come to the end of the end ... and I prayed ... yes, I

prayed.... I asked for a miracle ... and the next day it

seemed to have been worked.... Was it the prayer that did it?...

Was it any one's prayer?... Was it any one's faith?... Was

it—God?... Had faith and prayer and God anything to do with

it?... Do things happen by coincidence and chance?... or is there a

Mind that directs them?... I wonder!... I wonder!..."

THE END
