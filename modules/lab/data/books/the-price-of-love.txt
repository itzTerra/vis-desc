CHAPTER I
MONEY IN THE HOUSE

I
In the evening dimness of old Mrs. Maldon's sitting-room stood the

youthful virgin, Rachel Louisa Fleckring. The prominent fact about

her appearance was that she wore an apron. Not one of those

white, waist-tied aprons, with or without bibs, worn proudly,

uncompromisingly, by a previous generation of unaspiring housewives

and housegirls! But an immense blue pinafore-apron, covering the whole

front of the figure except the head, hands, and toes. Its virtues were

that it fully protected the most fragile frock against all the perils

of the kitchen; and that it could be slipped on or off in one

second, without any manipulation of tapes, pins, or buttons and

buttonholes—for it had no fastenings of any sort and merely yawned

behind. In one second the drudge could be transformed into the elegant

infanta of boudoirs, and vice versa. To suit the coquetry of

the age the pinafore was enriched with certain flouncings, which,

however, only intensified its unshapen ugliness.
On a plain, middle-aged woman such a pinafore would have been

intolerable to the sensitive eye. But on Rachel it simply had

a piquant and perverse air, because she was young, with the

incomparable, the unique charm of comely adolescence; it simply

excited the imagination to conceive the exquisite treasures of contour

and tint and texture which it veiled. Do not infer that Rachel was

a coquette. Although comely, she was homely—a "downright"

girl, scorning and hating all manner of pretentiousness. She had a fine best

dress, and when she put it on everybody knew that it was her best; a

stranger would have known. Whereas of a coquette none but her intimate

companions can say whether she is wearing best or second-best on a

given high occasion. Rachel used the pinafore-apron only with her best

dress, and her reason for doing so was the sound, sensible reason that

it was the usual and proper thing to do.
She opened a drawer of the new Sheraton sideboard, and took from it

a metal tube that imitated brass, about a foot long and an inch

in diameter, covered with black lettering. This tube, when she

had removed its top, showed a number of thin wax tapers in various

colours. She chose one, lit it neatly at the red fire, and then,

standing on a footstool in the middle of the room, stretched all her

body and limbs upward in order to reach the gas. If the tap had been

half an inch higher or herself half an inch shorter, she would have

had to stand on a chair instead of a footstool; and the chair would

have had to be brought out of the kitchen and carried back again. But

Heaven had watched over this detail. The gas-fitting consisted of a

flexible pipe, resembling a thick black cord, and swinging at the

end of it a specimen of that wonderful and blessed contrivance, the

inverted incandescent mantle within a porcelain globe: the whole

recently adopted by Mrs. Maldon as the dangerous final word of modern

invention. It was safer to ignite the gas from the orifice at the

top of the globe; but even so there was always a mild disconcerting

explosion, followed by a few moments' uncertainty as to whether or not

the gas had "lighted properly."
When the deed was accomplished and the room suddenly bright with soft

illumination, Mrs. Maldon murmured—
"That's better!"
She was sitting in her arm-chair by the glitteringly set table, which,

instead of being in the centre of the floor under the gas, had a place

near the bow-window—advantageous in the murky daytime of the Five

Towns, and inconvenient at night. The table might well have been

shifted at night to a better position in regard to the gas. But it

never was. Somehow for Mrs. Maldon the carpet was solid concrete, and

the legs of the table immovably embedded therein.
Rachel, gentle-footed, kicked the footstool away to its lair under the

table, and simultaneously extinguished the taper, which she dropped

with a scarce audible click into a vase on the mantelpiece. Then she

put the cover on the tube with another faintest click, restored the

tube to its drawer with a rather louder click, and finally, with a

click still louder, pushed the drawer home. All these slight sounds

were familiar to Mrs. Maldon; they were part of her regular night

life, part of an unconsciously loved ritual, and they contributed in

their degree to her placid happiness.
"Now the blinds, my dear!" said she.
The exhortation was ill-considered, and Rachel controlled a gesture of

amicable impatience. For she had not paused after closing the drawer;

she was already on her way across the room to the window when Mrs.

Maldon said, "Now the blinds, my dear!" The fact was that Mrs. Maldon

measured the time between the lighting of gas and the drawing down of

blinds by tenths of a second—such was her fear lest in that sinister

interval the whole prying town might magically gather in the street

outside and peer into the secrets of her inculpable existence.

II
When the blinds and curtains had been arranged for privacy, Mrs.

Maldon sighed securely and picked up her crocheting. Rachel rested her

hands on the table, which was laid for a supper for four, and asked in

a firm, frank voice whether there was anything else.
"Because, if not," Rachel added, "I'll just take off my pinafore and

wash my hands."
Mrs. Maldon looked up benevolently and nodded in quick agreement.

It was such apparently trifling gestures, eager and generous, that

endeared the old lady to Rachel, giving her the priceless sensation

of being esteemed and beloved. Her gaze lingered on her aged employer

with affection and with profound respect. Mrs. Maldon made a striking,

tall, slim figure, sitting erect in tight black, with the right side

of her long, prominent nose in the full gaslight and the other heavily

shadowed. Her hair was absolutely black at over seventy; her eyes were

black and glowing, and she could read and do coarse crocheting

without spectacles. All her skin, especially round about the eyes, was

yellowish brown and very deeply wrinkled indeed; a decrepit, senile

skin, which seemed to contradict the youth of her pose and her glance.

The cast of her features was benign. She had passed through desolating

and violent experiences, and then through a long, long period of

withdrawn tranquillity; and from end to end of her life she had

consistently thought the best of all men, refusing to recognize evil

and assuming the existence of good. Every one of the millions of her

kind thoughts had helped to mould the expression of her countenance.

The expression was definite now, fixed, intensely characteristic after

so many decades, and wherever it was seen it gave pleasure and by

its enchantment created goodness and goodwill—even out of their

opposites. Such was the life-work of Mrs. Maldon.
Her eyes embraced the whole room. They did not, as the phrase is,

"beam" approval; for the act of beaming involves a sort of ecstasy,

and Mrs. Maldon was too dignified for ecstasy. But they displayed a

mild and proud contentment as she said—
"I'm sure it's all very nice."
It was. The table crowded with porcelain, crystal, silver, and

flowers, and every object upon it casting a familiar curved shadow on

the whiteness of the damask toward the window! The fresh crimson and

blues of the everlasting Turkey carpet (Turkey carpet being the ne

plus ultra of carpetry in the Five Towns, when that carpet was

bought, just as sealskin was the ne plus ultra of all furs)!

The silken-polished sideboard, strange to the company, but worthy

of it, and exhibiting a due sense of its high destiny! The sombre

bookcase and corner cupboard, darkly glittering! The Chesterfield

sofa, broad, accepting, acquiescent! The flashing brass fender

and copper scuttle! The comfortably reddish walls, with their

pictures—like limpets on the face of precipices! The new-whitened

ceiling! In the midst the incandescent lamp that hung like the moon

in heaven!... And then the young, sturdy girl, standing over the

old woman and breathing out the very breath of life, vitalizing

everything, rejuvenating the old woman!
Mrs. Maldon's sitting-room had a considerable renown among her

acquaintance, not only for its peculiar charm, which combined and

reconciled the tastes of two very different generations, but also for

its radiant cleanness. There are many clean houses in the Five Towns,

using the adjective in the relative sense in which the Five Towns is

forced by chimneys to use it. But Mrs. Maldon's sitting-room (save for

the white window-curtains, which had to accept the common grey fate of

white window-curtains in the district) was clean in the country-side

sense, almost in the Dutch sense. The challenge of its cleanness

gleamed on every polished surface, victorious in the unending battle

against the horrible contagion of foul industries. Mrs. Maldon's

friends would assert that the state of that sitting-room "passed"

them, or "fair passed" them, and she would receive their ever-amazed

compliments with modesty. But behind her benevolent depreciation she

would be blandly saying to herself: "Yes, I'm scarcely surprised it

passes you—seeing the way you housewives let things go on here."

The word "here" would be faintly emphasized in her mind, as no native

would have emphasized it.
Rachel shared the general estimate of the sitting-room. She

appreciated its charm, and admitted to herself that her first vision

of it, rather less than a month before, had indeed given her a new and

startling ideal of cleanliness. On that occasion it had been evident,

from Mrs. Maldon's physical exhaustion, that the housemistress had

made an enormous personal effort to dazzle and inspire her new

"lady companion," which effort, though detected and perhaps scorned by

Rachel, had nevertheless succeeded in its aim. With a certain presence

of mind Rachel had feigned to remark nothing miraculous in the

condition of the room. Appropriating the new ideal instantly, she

had on the first morning of her service "turned out" the room before

breakfast, well knowing that it must have been turned out on the

previous day. Dumbfounded for a few moments, Mrs. Maldon had at length

said, in her sweet and cordial benevolence, "I'm glad to see we think

alike about cleanliness." And Rachel had replied with an air at once

deferential, sweet, and yet casual, "Oh, of course, Mrs. Maldon!" Then

they measured one another in a silent exchange. Mrs. Maldon was aware

that she had by chance discovered a pearl—yes, a treasure beyond

pearls. And Rachel, too, divined the high value of her employer, and

felt within the stirrings of a passionate loyalty to her.

III
And yet, during the three weeks and a half of their joint existence,

Rachel's estimate of Mrs. Maldon had undergone certain subtle

modifications.
At first, somewhat overawed, Rachel had seen in her employer the Mrs.

Maldon of the town's legend, which legend had travelled to Rachel

as far as Knype, whence she sprang. That is to say, one of the

great ladies of Bursley, ranking in the popular regard with

Mrs. Clayton-Vernon, the leader of society, Mrs. Sutton, the

philanthropist, and Mrs. Hamps, the powerful religious bully. She had

been impressed by her height (Rachel herself being no lamp-post), her

carriage, her superlative dignity, her benevolence of thought, and

above all by her aristocratic Southern accent. After eight-and-forty

years of the Five Towns, Mrs. Maldon had still kept most of that

Southern accent—so intimidating to the rough, broad talkers of the

district, who take revenge by mocking it among themselves, but for

whom it will always possess the thrilling prestige of high life.
And then day by day Rachel had discovered that great ladies are, after

all, human creatures, strangely resembling other human creatures. And

Mrs. Maldon slowly became for her an old woman of seventy-two,

with unquestionably wondrous hair, but failing in strength and in

faculties; and it grew merely pathetic to Rachel that Mrs. Maldon

should force herself always to sit straight upright. As for Mrs.

Maldon's charitableness, Rachel could not deny that she refused to

think evil, and yet it was plain that at bottom Mrs. Maldon was not

much deceived about people: in which apparent inconsistency there hid

a slight disturbing suggestion of falseness that mysteriously fretted

the downright Rachel.
Again, beneath Mrs. Maldon's modesty concerning the merits of her

sitting-room Rachael soon fancied that she could detect traces of an

ingenuous and possibly senile "house-pride," which did more than fret

the lady companion; it faintly offended her. That one should be proud

of a possession or of an achievement was admissible, but that one

should fail to conceal the pride absolutely was to Rachel, with her

Five Towns character, a sign of weakness, a sign of the soft South.

Lastly, Mrs. Maldon had, it transpired, her "ways"; for example, in

the matter of blinds and in the matter of tapers. She would actually

insist on the gas being lighted with a taper; a paper spill, which was

just as good and better, seemed to ruffle her benign placidity: and

she was funnily economical with matches. Rachel had never seen a taper

before, and could not conceive where the old lady managed to buy the

things.
In short, with admiration almost undiminished, and with a rapidly

growing love and loyalty, Rachel had arrived at the point of feeling

glad that she, a mature, capable, sagacious, and strong woman, was

there to watch over the last years of the waning and somewhat peculiar

old lady.
Mrs. Maldon did not see the situation from quite the same angle. She

did not, for example, consider herself to be in the least peculiar,

but, on the contrary, a very normal woman. She had always used tapers;

she could remember the period when every one used tapers. In her

view tapers were far more genteel and less dangerous than the untidy,

flaring spill, which she abhorred as a vulgarity. As for matches,

frankly it would not have occurred to her to waste a match when fire

was available. In the matter of her sharp insistence on drawn blinds

at night, domestic privacy seemed to be one of the fundamental

decencies of life—simply that! And as for house-pride, she considered

that she locked away her fervent feeling for her parlour in a manner

marvellous and complete.
No one could or ever would guess the depth of her attachment to that

sitting-room, nor the extent to which it engrossed her emotional life.

And yet she had only occupied the house for fourteen years out of the

forty-five years of her widowhood, and the furniture had at intervals

been renewed (for Mrs. Maldon would on no account permit herself to

be old-fashioned). Indeed, she had had five different sitting-rooms in

five different houses since her husband's death. No matter. They were

all the same sitting-room, all rendered identical by the mysterious

force of her dreamy meditations on the past. And, moreover, sundry

important articles had remained constant to preserve unbroken the

chain that linked her to her youth. The table which Rachel had so

nicely laid was the table at which Mrs. Maldon had taken her first

meal as mistress of a house. Her husband had carved mutton at it, and

grumbled about the consistency of toast; her children had spilt jam on

its cloth. And when on Sunday nights she wound up the bracket-clock on

the mantelpiece, she could see and hear a handsome young man in a long

frock-coat and a large shirt-front and a very thin black tie winding

it up too—her husband—on Sunday nights. And she could simultaneously

see another handsome young man winding it up—her son.
Her pictures were admired.
"Your son painted this water-colour, did he not, Mrs. Maldon?"
"Yes, my son Athelstan."
"How gifted he must have been!"
"Yes, the best judges say he showed very remarkable promise. It's

fading, I fear. I ought to cover it up, but somehow I can't fancy

covering it up—"
The hand that had so remarkably promised had lain mouldering for a

quarter of a century. Mrs. Maldon sometimes saw it, fleshless, on a

cage-like skeleton in the dark grave. The next moment she would see

herself tending its chilblains.
And if she was not peculiar, neither was she waning. No!

Seventy-two—but not truly old! How could she be truly old when she

could see, hear, walk a mile without stopping, eat anything whatever,

and dress herself unaided? And that hair of hers! Often she was still

a young wife, or a young widow. She was not preparing for death; she

had prepared for death in the seventies. She expected to live on

in calm satisfaction through indefinite decades. She savoured life

pleasantly, for its daily security was impregnable. She had forgotten

grief.
When she looked up at Rachel and benevolently nodded to her, she saw

a girl of line character, absolutely trustworthy, very devoted, very

industrious, very capable, intelligent, cheerful—in fact, a splendid

girl, a girl to be enthusiastic about! But such a mere girl! A girl

with so much to learn! So pathetically young and inexperienced

and positive and sure of herself! The looseness of her limbs, the

unconscious abrupt freedom of her gestures, the waviness of her auburn

hair, the candour of her glance, the warmth of her indignation against

injustice and dishonesty, the capricious and sensitive flowings of

blood to her smooth cheeks, the ridiculous wise compressings of

her lips, the rise and fall of her rich and innocent bosom—these

phenomena touched Mrs. Maldon and occasionally made her want to cry.
Thought she: "I was never so young as that at twenty-two! At

twenty-two I had had Mary!" The possibility that in spite of having

had Mary (who would now have been fifty, but for death) she had as a

fact been approximately as young as that at twenty-two did not ever

present itself to the waning and peculiar old lady. She was glad that

she, a mature and profoundly experienced woman, in full possession

of all her faculties, was there to watch over the development of the

lovable, affectionate, and impulsive child.

IV
"Oh! Here's the paper, Mrs. Maldon," said Rachel, as, turning away to

leave the room, she caught sight of the extra special edition of

the Signal, which lay a pale green on the dark green of the

Chesterfield.
Mrs. Maldon answered placidly—
"When did you bring it in? I never heard the boy come. But my

hearing's not quite what it used to be, that's true. Open it for me,

my dear. I can't stretch my arms as I used to."
She was one of the few women in the Five Towns who deigned to read

a newspaper regularly, and one of the still fewer who would lead the

miscellaneous conversation of drawing-rooms away from domestic chatter

and discussions of individualities, to political and municipal topics

and even toward general ideas. She seldom did more than mention a

topic and then express a hope for the best, or explain that this

phenomenon was "such a pity," or that phenomenon "such a good thing,"

or that about another phenomenon "one really didn't know what to

think." But these remarks sufficed to class her apart among her sex as

"a very up-to-date old lady, with a broad outlook upon the world,"

and to inspire sundry other ladies with a fearful respect for her

masculine intellect and judgment. She was aware of her superiority,

and had a certain kind disdain for the increasing number of women

who took in a daily picture-paper, and who, having dawdled over its

illustrations after breakfast, spoke of what they had seen in the

"newspaper." She would not allow that a picture-paper was a newspaper.
Rachel stood in the empty space under the gas. Her arms were stretched

out and slightly upward as she held the Signal wide open and

glanced at the newspaper, frowning. The light fell full on her coppery

hair. Her balanced body, though masked in front by the perpendicular

fall of the apron as she bent somewhat forward, was nevertheless the

image of potential vivacity and energy; it seemed almost to vibrate

with its own consciousness of physical pride.
Left alone, Rachel would never have opened a newspaper, at any rate

for the news. Until she knew Mrs. Maldon she had never seen a woman

read a newspaper for aught except the advertisements relating to

situations, houses, and pleasures. But, much more than she imagined,

she was greatly under the influence of Mrs. Maldon. Mrs. Maldon made

a nightly solemnity of the newspaper, and Rachel naturally soon

persuaded herself that it was a fine and a superior thing to read the

newspaper—a proof of unusual intelligence. Moreover, just as she

felt bound to show Mrs. Maldon that her notion of cleanliness was as

advanced as anybody's, so she felt bound to indicate, by an appearance

of casualness, that for her to read the paper was the most customary

thing in the world. Of course she read the paper! And that she should

calmly look at it herself before handing it to her mistress proved

that she had already established a very secure position in the house.
She said, her eyes following the lines, and her feet moving in the

direction of Mrs. Maldon— "Those burglaries are still going on ...

Hillport now!"
"Oh, dear, dear!" murmured Mrs. Maldon, as Rachel spread the newspaper

lightly over the tea-tray and its contents. "Oh, dear, dear! I do

hope the police will catch some one soon. I'm sure they're doing their

best, but really—!"
Rachel bent with confident intimacy over the old lady's shoulder, and

they read the burglary column together, Rachel interrupting herself

for an instant to pick up Mrs. Maldon's ball of black wool which had

slipped to the floor. The Signal reporter had omitted none of

the classic clichés proper to the subject, and such words

and phrases as "jemmy," "effected an entrance," "the servant, now

thoroughly alarmed," "stealthy footsteps," "escaped with their booty,"

seriously disquieted both of the women—caused a sudden sensation of

sinking in the region of the heart. Yet neither would put the secret

fear into speech, for each by instinct felt that a fear once uttered

is strengthened and made more real. Living solitary and unprotected

by male sinews, in a house which, though it did not stand alone, was

somewhat withdrawn from the town, they knew themselves the ideal prey

of conventional burglars with masks, dark lanterns, revolvers, and

jemmies. They were grouped together like some symbolic sculpture, and

with all their fortitude and common sense they still in unconscious

attitude expressed the helpless and resigned fatalism of their sex

before certain menaces of bodily danger, the thrilled, expectant

submission of women in a city about to be sacked.
Nothing could save them if the peril entered the house. But they would

not say aloud: "Suppose they came here! How terrible!" They

would not even whisper the slightest apprehension. They just briefly

discussed the matter with a fine air of indifferent aloofness,

remaining calm while the brick walls and the social system which

defended that bright and delicate parlour from the dark, savage

universe without seemed to crack and shiver.
Mrs. Maldon, suddenly noticing that one blind was half an inch

short of the bottom of the window, rose nervously and pulled it down

farther.
"Why didn't you ask me to do that?" said Rachel, thinking what a

fidgety person the old lady was.
Mrs. Maldon replied— "It's all right, my dear. Did you fasten the

window on the upstairs landing?"
"As if burglars would try to get in by an upstairs window—and on

the street!" thought Rachel, pityingly impatient. "However, it's her

house, and I'm paid to do what I'm told," she added to herself, very

sensibly. Then she said, aloud, in a soothing tone—
"No, I didn't. But I will do it."
She moved towards the door, and at the same moment a knock on the

front door sent a vibration through the whole house. Nearly all

knocks on the front door shook the house; and further, burglars do

not generally knock as a preliminary to effecting an entrance.

Nevertheless, both women started—and were ashamed of starting.
"Surely he's rather early!" said Mrs. Maldon with an exaggerated

tranquillity.
And Rachel, with a similar lack of conviction in her calm gait, went

audaciously forth into the dark lobby.

V
On the glass panels of the front door the street lamp threw a faint,

distorted shadow of a bowler hat, two rather protruding ears, and

a pair of long, outspreading whiskers whose ends merged into broad

shoulders. Any one familiar with the streets of Bursley would have

instantly divined that Councillor Thomas Batchgrew stood between the

gas-lamp and the front door. And even Rachel, whose acquaintance

with Bursley was still slight, at once recognized the outlines of the

figure. She had seen Councillor Batchgrew one day conversing with Mrs.

Maldon in Moorthorne Road, and she knew that he bore to Mrs. Maldon

the vague but imposing relation of "trustee."
There are many—indeed perhaps too many—remarkable men in the Five

Towns. Thomas Batchgrew was one of them. He had begun life as a small

plumber in Bursley market-place, living behind and above the shop, and

begetting a considerable family, which exercised itself in the back

yard among empty and full turpentine-cans. The original premises

survived, as a branch establishment, and Batchgrew's latest-married

grandson condescended to reside on the first floor, and to keep a

motor-car and a tri-car in the back yard, now roofed over (in a manner

not strictly conforming to the building by-laws of the borough).

All Batchgrew's sons and daughters were married, and several of his

grandchildren also. And all his children, and more than one of the

grandchildren, kept motor-cars. Not a month passed but some Batchgrew,

or some Batchgrew's husband or child, bought a motor-car, or sold one,

or exchanged a small one for a larger one, or had an accident, or

was gloriously fined in some distant part of the country for illegal

driving. Nearly all of them had spacious detached houses, with gardens

and gardeners, and patent slow-combustion grates, and porcelain

bathrooms comprising every appliance for luxurious splashing. And,

with the exception of one son who had been assisted to Valparaiso in

order that he might there seek death in the tankard without outraging

the family, they were all teetotallers—because the old man, "old

Jack," was a teetotaller. The family pyramid was based firm on the

old man. The numerous relatives held closely together like an alien

oligarchical caste in a conquered country. If they ever did quarrel,

it must have been in private.
The principal seat of business—electrical apparatus, heating

apparatus, and decorating and plumbing on a grandiose scale—in

Hanbridge, had over its immense windows the sign: "John Batchgrew

& Sons." The sign might well have read: "John Batchgrew & Sons,

Daughters, Daughters-in-law, Sons-in-law, Grandchildren, and

Great-grandchildren." The Batchgrew partners were always tendering

for, and often winning, some big contract or other for heating

and lighting and embellishing a public building or a mansion or a

manufactory. (They by no means confined their activities to the Five

Towns, having an address in London—and another in Valparaiso.) And

small private customers were ever complaining of the inaccuracy

of their accounts for small jobs. People who, in the age of Queen

Victoria's earlier widowhood, had sent for Batchgrew to repair a burst

spout, still by force of habit sent for Batchgrew to repair a burst

spout, and still had to "call at Batchgrew's" about mistakes in the

bills, which mistakes, after much argument and asseveration, were

occasionally put right. In spite of their prodigious expenditures, and

of a certain failure on the part of the public to understand "where

all the money came from," the financial soundness of the Batchgrews

was never questioned. In discussing the Batchgrews no bank-manager and

no lawyer had ever by an intonation or a movement of the eyelid hinted

that earthquakes had occurred before in the history of the world and

might occur again.
And yet old Batchgrew—admittedly the cleverest of the lot,

save possibly the Valparaiso soaker—could not be said to attend

assiduously to business. He scarcely averaged two hours a day on

the premises at Hanbridge. Indeed the staff there had a sense of

the unusual, inciting to unusual energy and devotion, when word went

round: "Guv'nor's in the office with Mr. John." The Councillor was

always extremely busy with something other than his main enterprise.

It was now reported, for example, that he was clearing vast sums out

of picture-palaces in Wigan and Warrington. Also he was a religionist,

being Chairman of the local Church of England Village Mission Fund.

And he was a politician, powerful in municipal affairs. And he was a

reformer, who believed that by abolishing beer he could abolish the

poverty of the poor—and acted accordingly. And lastly he liked to

enjoy himself.
Everybody knew by sight his flying white whiskers and protruding ears.

And he himself was well aware of the steady advertising value of

those whiskers—of always being recognizable half a mile off. He met

everybody unflinchingly, for he felt that he was invulnerable at all

points and sure of a magnificent obituary. He was invariably treated

with marked deference and respect. But he was not an honest man. He

knew it. All his family knew it. In business everybody knew it except

a few nincompoops. Scarcely any one trusted him. The peculiar fashion

in which, when he was not present, people "old Jacked" him—this alone

was enough to condemn a man of his years. Lastly, everybody knew that

most of the Batchgrew family was of a piece with its head.

VI

Now Rachel had formed a prejudice against old Batchgrew. She had

formed it, immutably, in a single second of time. One glance at him

in the street—and she had tried and condemned him, according to

the summary justice of youth. She was in that stage of plenary and

unhesitating wisdom when one not only can, but one must, divide the

whole human race sharply into two categories, the sheep and the goats;

and she had sentenced old Batchgrew to a place on the extreme left.

It happened that she knew nothing against him. But she did not require

evidence. She simply did "not like that man"—(she italicized

the end of the phrase bitingly to herself)—and there was no appeal

against the verdict. Angels could not have successfully interceded

for him in the courts of her mind. He never guessed, in his aged

self-sufficiency, that his case was hopeless with Rachel, nor even

that the child had dared to have any opinion about him at all.
She was about to slip off the pinafore-apron and drop it on to the

oak chest that stood in the lobby. But she thought with defiance: "Why

should I take my pinafore off for him? I won't. He shan't see my nice

frock. Let him see my pinafore. I am an independent woman, earning my

own living, and why should I be ashamed of my pinafore? My pinafore is

good enough for him!" She also thought: "Let him wait!" and went off

into the kitchen to get the modern appliance of the match for lighting

the gas in the lobby. When she had lighted the gas she opened the

front door with audacious but nervous deliberation, and the famous

character impatiently walked straight in. He wore prominent loose

black kid gloves and a thin black overcoat.
Looking coolly at her, he said—
"So you're the new lady companion, young miss! Well, I've heard rare

accounts on ye—rare accounts on ye! Missis is in, I reckon?"
His voice was extremely low, rich, and heavy. It descended on the

silence like a thick lubricating oil that only reluctantly abandons

the curves in which it falls.
And Rachel answered, faintly, tremulously— "Yes."
No longer was she the independent woman, censorious and scornful, but

a silly, timid little thing. Though she condemned herself savagely for

school-girlishness, she could do nothing to arrest the swift change in

her. The fact was, she was abashed, partly by the legendary importance

of the renowned Batchgrew, but more by his physical presence. His

mere presence was always disturbing; for when he supervened into

an environment he had always the air of an animal on a voyage of

profitable discovery. His nose was an adventurous, sniffing nose, a

true nose, which exercised the original and proper functions of a nose

noisily. His limbs were restless, his boots like hoofs. His eyes were

as restless as his limbs, and seemed ever to be seeking for something

upon which they could definitely alight, and not finding it. He

performed eructations with the disarming naturalness of a baby. He was

tall but not stout, and yet he filled the lobby; he was the sole fact

in the lobby, and it was as though Rachel had to crush herself against

the wall in order to make room for him.
His glance at Rachel now became inquisitive, calculating, It seemed to

be saying: "One day I may be able to make use of this piece of goods."

But there was a certain careless good-humour in it, too. What he saw

was a naïve young maid, with agreeable features, and a fine, fresh

complexion, and rather reddish hair. (He did not approve of the

colour of the hair.) He found pleasure in regarding her, and in the

perception that he had abashed her. Yes, he liked to see her timid and

downcast before him. He was an old man, but like most old men—such as

statesmen—who have lived constantly at the full pressure of following

their noses, he was also a young man. He creaked, but he was not

gravely impaired.
"Is it Mr. Batchgrew?" Rachel softly murmured the unnecessary

question, with one hand on the knob ready to open the sitting-room

door.
He had flopped his stiff, flat-topped felt hat on the oak chest, and

was taking off his overcoat. He paused and, lifting his chin—and his

incredible white whiskers with it—gazed at Rachel almost steadily for

a couple of seconds.
"It is," he said, as it were challengingly—"it is, young miss."
Then he finished removing his overcoat and thrust it roughly down on

the hat.
Rachel blushed as she modestly turned the knob and pushed the door so

that he might pass in front of her.
"Here's Mr. Batchgrew, Mrs. Maldon," she announced, feebly

endeavouring to raise and clear her voice.
"Bless us!" The astonished exclamation of Mrs. Maldon was heard.
And Councillor Batchgrew, with his crimson shiny face, and the

vermilion rims round his unsteady eyes, and his elephant ears, and

the absurd streaming of his white whiskers, and his multitudinous

noisiness, and his black kid gloves, strode half theatrically past

her, sniffing.
To Rachel he was an object odious, almost obscene. In truth, she

had little mercy on old men in general, who as a class struck her as

fussy, ridiculous, and repulsive. And beyond all the old men she had

ever seen, she disliked Councillor Batchgrew. And about Councillor

Batchgrew what she most detested was, perhaps strangely, his loose,

wrinkled black kid gloves. They were ordinary, harmless black kid

gloves, but she counted them against him as a supreme offence.
"Conceited, self-conscious, horrid old brute!" she thought, discreetly

drawing the door to, and then going into the kitchen. "He's interested

in nothing and nobody but himself." She felt protective towards Mrs.

Maldon, that simpleton who apparently could not see through a John

Batchgrew!... So Mrs. Maldon had been giving him good accounts of the

new lady companion, had she!

VII
"Well, Lizzie Maldon," said Councillor Batchgrew as he crossed the

sitting-room, "how d'ye find yourself?... Sings!" he went on, taking

Mrs. Maldon's hand with a certain negligence and at the same time

fixing an unfriendly eye on the gas.
Mrs. Maldon had risen to welcome him with the punctilious warmth due

to an old gentleman, a trustee, and a notability. She told him as

to her own health and inquired about his. But he ignored her smooth

utterances, in the ardour of following his nose.
"Sings worse than ever! Very unhealthy too! Haven't I told ye and told

ye? You ought to let me put electricity in for you. It isn't as if it

wasn't your own house.... Pay ye! Pay ye over and over again!"
He sat down in a chair by the table, drew off his loose black gloves,

and after letting them hover irresolutely over the encumbered table,

deposited them for safety in the china slop-basin.
"I dare say you're quite right," said Mrs. Maldon with grave urbanity.

"But really gas suits me very well. And you know the gas-manager

complains so much about the competition of electricity. Truly it does

seem unfair, doesn't it, as they both belong to the town! If I gave

up gas for electricity I don't think I could look the poor man in the

face at church. And all these changes cost money! How is dear Enid?"
Mr. Batchgrew had now stretched out his legs and crossed one over the

other; and he was twisting his thumbs on his diaphragm.
"Enid? Oh! Enid! Well, I did hear she's able to nurse the child

at last." He spoke of his grand-daughter-in-law as of one among a

multiplicity of women about whose condition vague rumours reached him

at intervals.
Mrs. Maldon breathed fervently—"I'm so thankful! What a blessing

that is, isn't it?"
"As for costing money, Elizabeth," Mr. Batchgrew proceeded, "you'll

be all right now for money." He paused, sat up straight with puffings,

and leaned sideways against the table. Then he said, half fiercely—

"I've settled up th' Brougham Street mortgage."
"You don't say so!" Mrs. Maldon was startled.
"I do!"
"When?"
"To-day."
"Well—"
"That's what I stepped in for."
Mrs. Maldon feebly murmured, with obvious emotion—
"You can't imagine what a relief it is to me!" Tears shone in her

dark, mild eyes.
"Look ye!" exclaimed the trustee curtly.
He drew from his breast pocket a bank envelope of linen, and then,

glancing at the table, pushed cups and saucers abruptly away to make a

clear space on the white cloth. The newspaper slipped rustling to the

floor on the side near the window. Already his gloves were abominable

in the slop-basin, and now with a single gesture he had destroyed the

symmetry of the set table. Mrs. Maldon with surpassing patience smiled

sweetly, and assured herself that Mr. Batchgrew could not help it. He

was a coarse male creature at large in a room highly feminized. It was

his habit thus to pass through orderly interiors, distributing havoc,

like a rough soldier. You might almost hear a sword clanking in the

scabbard.
"Ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty," he began in his heavily

rolling voice to count out one by one a bundle of notes which he had

taken from the envelope. He generously licked his thick, curved-back

thumb for the separating of the notes, and made each note sharply

click, in the manner of a bank cashier, to prove to himself that it

was not two notes stuck together. "... Five-seventy, five-eighty,

five-ninety, six hundred. These are all tens. Now the fives: Five,

ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five." He counted up to three hundred and

sixty-five. "That's nine-sixty-five altogether. The odd sixty-five's

arrear of interest. I'm investing nine hundred again to-morrow, and

th' interest on th' new investment is to start from th' first o' this

month. So instead of being out o'pocket, you'll be in pocket, missis."
The notes lay in two irregular filmy heaps on the table.
Having carefully returned the empty envelope to his pocket, Mr.

Batchgrew sat back, triumphant, and his eye met the delighted yet

disturbed eye of Mrs. Maldon, and then wavered and dodged.
Mr. Batchgrew with all his romantic qualities, lacked any perception

of the noble and beautiful in life, and it could be positively

asserted that his estimate of Mrs. Maldon was chiefly disdainful. But

of Mrs. Maldon's secret opinion about John Batchgrew nothing could be

affirmed with certainty. Nobody knew it or ever would know it. I doubt

whether Mrs. Maldon had whispered it even to herself. In youth he

had been the very intimate friend of her husband. Which fact would

scarcely tally with Mrs. Maldon's memory of her husband as the most

upright and perspicacious of men—unless on the assumption that John

Batchgrew's real characteristics had not properly revealed themselves

until after his crony's death; this assumption was perhaps admissible.

Mrs. Maldon invariably spoke of John Batchgrew with respect and

admiration. She probably had perfect confidence in him as a trustee,

and such confidence was justified, for the Councillor knew as well

as anybody in what fields rectitude was a remunerative virtue, and in

what fields it was not.
Indeed, as a trustee his sense of honour and of duty was so nice that

in order to save his ward from loss in connection with a depreciating

mortgage security, he had invented, as a Town Councillor, the

"Improvement" known as the "Brougham Street Scheme." If this was not

said outright, it was hinted. At any rate, the idea was fairly current

that had not Councillor Batchgrew been interested in Brougham Street

property, the Brougham Street Scheme, involving the compulsory

purchase of some of that property at the handsome price naturally

expected from the munificence of corporations, would never have come

into being.
Mrs. Maldon knew of the existence of the idea, which had been

obscurely referred to by a licensed victualler (inimically prejudiced

against the teetotaller in Mr. Batchgrew) at a Council meeting

reported in the Signal. And it was precisely this knowledge

which had imparted to her glance the peculiar disturbed quality that

had caused Mr. Batchgrew to waver and dodge.
The occasion demanded the exercise of unflinching common sense, and

Mrs. Maldon was equal to it. She very wisely decided that she ought

not to concern herself, and could not concern herself, with an aspect

of the matter which concerned her trustee alone. And therefore she

gave her heart entirely up to an intense gladness at the integral

recovery of the mortgage money.
For despite her faith in the efficiency of her trustee, Mrs. Maldon

would worry about finance; she would yield to an exquisitely painful

dread lest "anything should happen"—happen, that is, to prevent her

from dying in the comfortable and dignified state in which she had

lived. Her income was not large—a little under three hundred pounds

a year—but with care it sufficed for her own wants, and for gifts,

subscriptions, and an occasional carriage. There would have been a

small margin but for the constant rise in prices. As it was, there was

no permanent margin. And to have cut off a single annual subscription,

or lessened a single customary gift, would have mortally wounded her

pride. The gradual declension of property values in Brougham Street

had been a danger that each year grew more menacing. The moment had

long ago come when the whole rents of the mortgaged cottages would not

cover her interest. The promise of the Corporation Improvement Scheme

had only partially reassured her; it seemed too good to be true. She

could not believe without seeing. She now saw, suddenly, blindingly.

And her relief, beneath that stately deportment of hers, was pathetic

in its simple intensity. It would have moved John Batchgrew, had he

been in any degree susceptible to the thrill of pathos.
"I doubt if I've seen so much money all at once before," said Mrs.

Maldon, smiling weakly.
"Happen not!" said Mr. Batchgrew, proud, with insincere casualness,

and he added in exactly the same tone: "I'm leaving it with ye

to-night."
Mrs. Maldon was aghast, but she feigned sprightliness as she

exclaimed—
"You're not leaving all this money here to-night?"
"I am," said the trustee. "That's what I came for. Evans's were three

hours late in completing, and the bank was closed. I have but just got

it. I'm not going home." (He lived eight miles off, near Axe.) "I've

got to go to a Church meeting at Red Cow, and I'm sleeping there.

John's Ernest is calling here for me presently. I don't fancy driving

over them moors with near a thousand pun in my pocket—and colliers

out on strike—not at my age, missis! If you don't know what Red Cow

is, I reckon I do. It's your money. Put it in a drawer and say nowt,

and I'll fetch it to-morrow. What'll happen to it, think ye, seeing

as it hasn't got legs?" He spoke with the authority of a trustee. And

Mrs. Maldon felt that her reputation for sensible equanimity was worth

preserving. So she said bravely—
"I suppose it will be all right."
"Of course!" snapped the trustee patronizingly.
"But I must tell Rachel."
"Rachel? Rachel? Oh! Her! Why tell any one?" Mr. Batchgrew

sniffed very actively.
"Oh! I shouldn't be easy if I didn't tell Rachel," insisted Mrs.

Maldon with firmness.
Before the trustee could protest anew she had rung the bell.

VIII
It was another and an apronless Rachel that entered the room, a Rachel

transformed, magnificent in light green frock with elaborate lacy

ruchings and ornamentations, and the waist at the new fashionable

height. Her ruddy face and hands were fresh from water, her hair very

glossy and very neat: she was in high array. This festival attire

Mrs. Maldon now fully beheld for the first time. It, indeed, honoured

herself, for she had ordained a festive evening: but at the same

time she was surprised and troubled by it. As for Mr. Batchgrew, he

entirely ignored the vision. Stretched out in one long inclined plane

from the back of his chair down to the brass fender, he contemplated

the fire, while picking his teeth with a certain impatience, and still

sniffing actively. The girl resented this disregard. But, though she

remained hostile to the grotesque old man with his fussy noises,

the mantle of Mrs. Maldon's moral protection was now over Councillor

Batchgrew, and Rachel's mistrustful scorn of him had lost some of its

pleasing force.
"Rachel—"
Mrs. Maldon gave a hesitating cough.
"Yes, Mrs. Maldon?" said Rachel questioningly deferential, and smiling

faintly into Mrs. Maldon's apprehensive eyes. Against the background

of the aged pair she seemed dramatically young, lithe, living, and

wistful. She was nervous, but she thought with strong superiority:

"What are those old folks planning together? Why do they ring for me?"
At length Mrs. Maldon proceeded—"I think I ought to tell you, dear,

Mr. Batchgrew is obliged to leave this money in my charge to-night."
"What money?" asked Rachel.
Mr. Batchgrew put in sharply, drawing up his legs— "This!... Here,

young miss! Step this way, if ye please. I'll count it. Ten, twenty,

thirty—" With new lickings and clickings he counted the notes

all over again. "There!" When he had finished his pride had become

positively naïve.
"Oh, my word!" murmured Rachel, awed and astounded.
"It is rather a lot, isn't it?" said Mrs. Maldon, with a timid laugh.
At once fascinated and repelled, the two women looked at the money as

at a magic. It represented to Mrs. Maldon a future free from financial

embarrassment; it represented to Rachel more than she could earn in

half a century at her wage of eighteen pounds a year, an unimaginable

source of endless gratifications; and yet the mere fact that it was

to stay in the house all night changed it for them into something dire

and formidable, so that it inspired both of them—the ancient dame and

the young girl—with naught but a mystic dread. Mr. Batchgrew eyed the

affrighted creatures with satisfaction, appearing to take a perverse

pleasure in thus imposing upon them the horrid incubus.
"I was only thinking of burglars;" said Mrs. Maldon apologetically.

"There've been so many burglaries lately—" She ceased, uncertain of

her voice. The forced lightness of her tone was almost tragic.
"There won't be any more," said Mr. Batchgrew condescendingly.

"Why?" demanded Mrs. Maldon with an eager smile of hope. "Have they

caught them, then? Has Superintendent Snow—"
"They have their hands on them. To-morrow there'll be some arrests,"

Mr. Batchgrew answered, exuding authority. For he was not merely a

Town Councillor, he was brother-in-law to the Superintendent of the

Borough Police. "Caught 'em long ago if th' county police had been a

bit more reliable!"
"Oh!" Mrs. Maldon breathed happily. "I knew it couldn't be Mr. Snow's

fault. I felt sure of that. I'm so glad."
And Rachel also was conscious of gladness. In fact, it suddenly seemed

plain to both women that no burglar, certain of arrest on the morrow,

would dare to invade the house of a lady whose trustee had married

the sister of the Superintendent of Police. The house was invisibly

protected.
"And we mustn't forget we shall have a man sleeping here to-night,"

said Rachel confidently.
"Of course! Of course! I was quite overlooking that!" exclaimed Mrs.

Maldon.
Mr. Batchgrew threw a curt and suspicious question— "What man?"
"My nephew Julian—I should say my grand-nephew." Mrs. Maldon's proud

tone rebuked the strange tone of Mr. Batchgrew. "It is his birthday.

He and Louis are having supper with me. And Julian is staying the

night."
"Well, if you take my advice, missis, ye'll say nowt to nobody. Lock

the brass up in a drawer in that wardrobe of yours, and keep a still

tongue in your head."
"Perhaps you're right," Mrs. Maldon agreed—"as a matter of general

principle, I mean. And it might make Julian uneasy."
"Take it and lock it up," Mr. Batchgrew repeated.
"I don't know about my wardrobe—" Mrs. Maldon began.
"Anywhere!" Mr. Batchgrew stopped her.
"Only," said Rachel with careful gentleness, "please don't forget

where you have put it."
But her precaution of manner was futile. Twice within a minute she had

employed the word "forget." Twice was too often. Mrs. Maldon's memory

was most capriciously uncertain. Its lapses astonished sometimes even

herself. And naturally she was sensitive on the point. She nourished

the fiction, and she expected others to nourish it, that her memory

was quite equal to younger memories. Indeed, she would admit every

symptom of old age save an unreliable memory.
Composing a dignified smile, she said with reproving blandness—
"I am not in the habit of forgetting where I put valuables, Rachel."
And her prominently veined fingers, clasping the notes as a

preliminary to hiding them away, seemed in their nervous primness to

be saying to Rachael: "I have deep confidence in you, and I think that

to-night I have shown it. But oblige me by not presuming. I am Mrs.

Maldon and you are Rachel. After all, I have not yet known you for a

month."

IX
A very loud rasping noise, like a vicious menace, sounded from the

street, shivering instantaneously the delicate placidity of Mrs.

Maldon's home. Mrs. Maldon gave a start.
"That'll be John's Ernest with the car," said Mr. Batchgrew, amused;

and he began to get up from the chair. As soon as he was on his feet

his nose grew active again. "You've nothing to be afraid of, missis,"

he added in a tone roughly reassuring and good-natured.
"Oh no! Of course not!" concurred Mrs. Maldon, further enforcing

intrepidity on herself. "Of course not! I only just mentioned burglars

because they're so much in the paper." And she stooped to pick up the

Signal and folded it carefully, as if to prove that her mind

was utterly collected.
Councillor Batchgrew, leaning over the table, peered into various

vessels in search of his gloves. At length he took them finickingly

from the white slop-basin as though fishing them out of a puddle. He

began to put them on, and then, half-way through the process, abruptly

shook hands with Mrs. Maldon.
"Then you'll call in the morning?" she asked.
"Aye! Ye may count on me. I'll relieve ye on [of] it afore ten

o'clock. It'll be on my way to Hanbridge, ye see."
Mrs. Maldon ceremoniously accompanied her trustee as far as the

sitting-room door, where she recommended him to the careful attention

of Rachel. No woman in the Five Towns could take leave of a guest

with more impressive dignity than old Mrs. Maldon, whose fine Southern

accent always gave a finish to her farewells. In the lobby Mr.

Batchgrew kept Rachel waiting with his overcoat in her outstretched

hands while he completed the business of his gloves. As, close behind

him, she coaxed his stiff arms into the overcoat, she suddenly

felt that after all he was nothing but a decrepit survival; and his

offensiveness seemed somehow to have been increased—perhaps by the

singular episode of the gloves and the slop-basin. She opened the

front door, and without a word to her he departed down the steps.
Two lamps like lighthouses glared fiercely along the roadway, dulling

the municipal gas and giving to each loose stone on the macadam a

long shadow. In the gloom behind the lamps the low form of an open

automobile showed, and a dim, cloaked figure beside it. A boyish voice

said with playful bullying sharpness, above the growling, irregular

pulsation of the engine— "Here, grandad, you've got to put this on."
"Have I?" demanded uncertainly the thick, heavy voice of the old man.
"Yes, you have—on the top of your other coat. If I don't look after

you I shall get myself into a row!... Here, let me put your fist in

the armhole. It's your blooming glove that stops it.... There! Now, up

with you, grandad!... All right! I've got you. I sha'n't drop you."
A door snapped to; then another. The car shot violently forward,

with shrieks and a huge buzzing noise, and leaped up the slope of the

street. Rachel, still in the porch, could see Mr. Batchgrew's head

wagging rather helplessly from side to side, just above the red speck

of the tail-lamp. Then the whole vision was swiftly blotted out, and

the warning shrieks of the invisible car grew fainter on the way to

Red Cow. It pleased Rachel to think of the old man being casually

bullied and shaken by John's Ernest.
She leaned forward and gazed down the street, not up it. When she

turned into the house Mrs. Maldon was descending the stairs, which,

being in a line with the lobby, ended opposite the front door. Judging

by the fixity of the old lady's features, Rachel decided that she was

not yet quite pardoned for the slight she had put upon the memory of

her employer. So she smiled pleasantly.
"Don't close the front door, dear," said Mrs. Maldon stiffly. "There's

some one there."
Rachel looked round. She had actually, in sheer absent-mindedness

or negligence or deafness, been shutting the door in the face of the

telegraph-boy!
"Oh, dear! I do hope—!" Mrs. Maldon muttered as she hastily tugged at

the envelope.
Having read the message, she passed it on to Rachel, and at the

same time forgivingly responded to her smile. The excitement of the

telegram had sufficed to dissipate Mrs. Maldon's trifling resentment.
Rachel read—
"Train hour late. Julian."
The telegraph boy was dismissed: "No answer, thank you."

X
During the next half-hour excitement within the dwelling gradually

increased. It grew out of nothing—out of Mrs. Maldon's admirable calm

in receiving the message of the telegram—until it affected like an

atmospheric disturbance the ground floor—the sitting-room where

Mrs. Maldon was spending nervous force in the effort to preserve an

absolutely tranquil mind, the kitchen where Rachel was "putting back"

the supper, the lobby towards which Rachel's eye and Mrs. Maiden's

ear were strained to catch any sign of an arrival, and the unlighted,

unused room behind the sitting-room which seemed to absorb and even

intensify the changing moods of the house.
The fact was that Mrs. Maldon, in her relief at finding that Julian

was not killed or maimed for life in a railway accident, had begun by

treating a delay of one hour in all her arrangements for the evening

as a trifle. But she had soon felt that, though a trifle, it was

really very upsetting and annoying. It gave birth to irrational yet

real forebodings as to the non-success of her little party. It

meant that the little party had "started badly." And then her other

grand-nephew, Louis Fores, did not arrive. He had been invited for

supper at seven, and should have appeared at five minutes to seven

at the latest. But at five minutes to seven he had not come; nor at

seven, nor at five minutes past—he who had barely a quarter of a

mile to walk! There was surely a fate against the party! And Rachel

strangely persisted in not leaving the kitchen! Even after Mrs. Maldon

had heard her fumbling for an interminable time with the difficult

window on the first-floor landing, she went back to the kitchen

instead of presenting herself to her expectant mistress.
At last Rachel entered the sitting-room, faintly humming an air. Mrs.

Maldon thought that she looked self-conscious. But Mrs. Maldon also

was self-conscious, and somehow could not bring her lips to utter

the name of Louis Fores to Rachel. For the old lady had divined a

connection of cause and effect between Louis Fores and the apparition

of Rachel's superlative frock. And she did not like the connection; it

troubled her, and offended the extreme nicety of her social code.
There was a constrained silence, which was broken by the lobby clock

striking the first quarter after seven. This harsh announcement on the

part of the inhuman clock seemed to render the situation intolerable.

Fifteen minutes past seven, and Louis not come, and not a word of

comment thereon! Mrs. Maldon had to admit privately that she was in a

high state of agitation.
Then Rachel, bending delicately to sweep the hearth with the

brass-handled brush proper to it, remarked with an obvious affectation

of nonchalance—
"Your other guest's late too."
If Mrs. Maldon had not been able to speak his name, neither could

Rachel! Mrs. Maldon read with painful certainty all the girl's

symptoms.
"Yes, indeed!" said Mrs. Maldon.
"It's like as if what must be!" Rachel murmured, employing a local

phrase which Mrs. Maldon had ever contemned as meaningless and

ungrammatical.
"Fortunately it doesn't matter, as Julian is late too," said Mrs.

Maldon insincerely, for it was mattering very much. "But still—I

wonder—"
Rachel broke out upon her hesitation in a very startling manner—
"I'll just see if he's coming."
And she abruptly quitted the room, almost slamming the door.
Mrs. Maldon was dumbfounded. Scared and attentive, she listened in a

maze for the sound of the front door. She heard it open. But was it

possible that she heard also the creak of the gate? She sprang to the

bow window with surprising activity, and pulled aside a blind, one

inch.... There was Rachel tripping hatless and in her best frock

down the street! Inconceivable vision, affecting Mrs. Maldon with

palpitation! A girl so excellent, so lovable, so trustworthy, to be

guilty of the wanton caprice of a minx! Supposing Louis were to see

her, to catch her in the brazen act of looking for him! Mrs. Maldon

was grieved; and her gentle sorrow for Rachel's incalculable lapse was

so dignified, affectionate, and jealous for the good repute of human

nature that it mysteriously ennobled instead of degrading the young

creature.

XI
Going down Bycars Lane amid the soft wandering airs of the September

night, Rachel had the delicious and exciting sensation of being

unyoked, of being at liberty for a space to obey the strong, free

common sense of youth instead of conforming to the outworn and

tiresome code of another age. Mrs. Maldon's was certainly a house that

put a strain on the nerves. It did not occur to Rachel that she was

doing aught but a very natural and proper thing. The non-appearance

of Louis Fores was causing disquiet, and her simple aim was to shorten

the period of anxiety. Nor did it occur to her that she was impulsive.

Something had to be done, and she had done something. Not much longer

could she have borne the suspense. All that day she had lived forward

towards supper-time, when Louis Fores would appear. Over and over

again she had lived right through the moment of opening the front door

for him at a little before seven o'clock. The moments between

seven o'clock and a quarter past had been a crescendo of torment,

intolerable at last. His lateness was inexplicable, and he was so

close to that not to look for him would have been ridiculous.
She was apprehensive, and yet she was obscurely happy in her fears.

The large, inviting, dangerous universe was about her—she had escaped

from the confining shelter of the house. And the night was about

her. It was not necessary for her to wear three coats, like the gross

Batchgrew, in order to protect herself from the night! She could go

forth into it with no precaution. She was young. Her vigorous and

confident body might challenge perils.
When she had proceeded a hundred yards she stopped and turned to look

back at the cluster of houses collectively called Bycars.
The distinctive bow-window of Mrs. Maldon's shone yellow. Within the

sacred room was still the old lady, sitting expectant, and trying to

interest herself in the paper. Strange thought!
Bycars Lane led in a north-easterly direction over the broad hill

whose ridge separates the lane from the moorlands honeycombed with

coal and iron mines. Above the ridge showed the fire and vapour of

the first mining villages, on the way to Red Cow, proof that not all

colliers were yet on strike. And above that pyrotechny hung the

moon. The municipal park, of which Bycars Lane was the north-western

boundary, lay in mysterious and forbidden groves behind its spiked

red wall and locked gates, and beyond it a bright tram-car was leaping

down from lamp to lamp of Moorthorne Road towards the town. Between

the masses of the ragged hedge on the north side of the lane there was

the thin gleam of Bycars Pool, lost in a vague, unoccupied region of

shawdrucks and dirty pasture—the rendezvous of skaters when the frost

held, Louis Fores had told her, and she had heard from another source

that he skated divinely. She could believe it, too.
She resumed her way more slowly. She had only stopped because, though

burned with the desire to see him, she yet had an instinct to postpone

the encounter. She was almost minded to return. But she went on. The

town was really very near. The illuminated clock of the Town Hall

had dominion over it; the golden shimmer above the roofs to the left

indicated the electrical splendour of the new Cinema in Moorthorne

Road next to the new Primitive Methodist Chapel. He had told her about

that, too. In two minutes, in less than two minutes, she was among

houses again, and approaching the corner of Friendly Street. He would

come from the Moorthorne Road end of Friendly Street. She would peep

round the corner of Friendly Street to see if he was coming....
But before she reached the corner, her escapade suddenly presented

itself to her as childish madness, silly, inexcusable; and she thought

self-reproachfully, "How impulsive I am!" and sharply turned back

towards Mrs. Maldon's house, which seemed to be about ten miles off.
A moment later she heard hurried footfalls behind her on the narrow

brick pavement, and, after one furtive glance over her shoulder, she

quickened her pace. Louis Fores in all his elegance was pursuing her!

Nothing had happened to him. He was not ill; he was merely a little

late! After all, she would sit by his side at the supper-table! She

had a spasm of shame that was excruciating. But at the same time she

was wildly glad. And already this inebriating illusion of an ingenuous

girl concerning a common male was helping to shape monstrous events.

CHAPTER II
LOUIS' DISCOVERY

I
Louis Fores was late at his grand-aunt's because he had by a certain

preoccupation, during a period of about an hour, been rendered

oblivious of the passage of time. The real origin of the affair went

back nearly sixty years, to an indecorous episode in the history of

the Maldon family.
At that date—before Mrs. Maldon had even met Austin Maldon, her

future husband—Austin's elder brother Athelstan, who was well

established as an earthenware broker in London, had a conjugal

misfortune, which reached its climax in the Matrimonial Court, and

left the injured and stately Athelstan with an incomplete household,

a spoiled home, and the sole care of two children, a boy and a girl.

These children were, almost of necessity, clumsily brought up. The

girl married the half-brother of a Lieutenant-General Fores, and Louis

Fores was their son. The boy married an American girl, and had issue,

Julian Maldon and some daughters.
At the age of eighteen, Louis Fores, amiable, personable, and an

orphan, was looking for a career. He had lived in the London suburb of

Barnes, and under the influence of a father whose career had chiefly

been to be the stepbrother of Lieutenant-General Fores. He was in

full possession of the conventionally snobbish ideals of the suburb,

reinforced by more than a tincture of the stupendous and unsurpassed

snobbishness of the British Army. He had no money, and therefore the

liberal professions and the higher division of the Civil Service were

closed to him. He had the choice of two activities: he might tout for

wine, motor-cars, or mineral-waters on commission (like his father),

or he might enter a bank; his friends were agreed that nothing else

was conceivable. He chose the living grave. It is not easy to enter

the living grave, but, august influences aiding, he entered it with

éclat at a salary of seventy pounds a year, and it closed

over him. He would have been secure till his second death had he not

defiled the bier. The day of judgment occurred, the grave opened, and

he was thrown out with ignominy, but ignominy unpublished. The august

influences, by simple cash, and for their own sakes, had saved him

from exposure and a jury.
In order to get rid of him his protectors spoke well of him,

emphasizing his many good qualities, and he was deported to the Five

Towns (properly enough, since his grandfather had come thence)

and there joined the staff of Batchgrew & Sons, thanks to the kind

intervention of Mrs. Maldon. At the end of a year John Batchgrew told

him to go, and told Mrs. Maldon that her grand-nephew had a fault.

Mrs. Maldon was very sorry. At this juncture Louis Fores, without

intending to do so, would certainly have turned Mrs. Maldon's last

years into a tragedy, had he not in the very nick of time inherited

about a thousand pounds. He was rehabilitated. He "had money" now. He

had a fortune; he had ten thousand pounds; he had any sum you like,

according to the caprice of rumour. He lived on his means for a

little time, frequenting the Municipal School of Art at the Wedgwood

Institution at Bursley, and then old Batchgrew had casually suggested

to Mrs. Maldon that there ought to be an opening for him with Jim

Horrocleave, who was understood to be succeeding with his patent

special processes for earthenware manufacture. Mr. Horrocleave, a man

with a chin, would not accept him for a partner, having no desire to

share profits with anybody; but on the faith of his artistic tendency

and Mrs. Maldon's correct yet highly misleading catalogue of his

virtues, he took him at a salary, in return for which Louis was to be

the confidential employee who could and would do anything, including

design.
And now Louis was the step-nephew of a Lieutenant-General, a man

of private means and of talent, and a trusted employee with a fine

wage—all under one skin! He shone in Bursley, and no wonder! He was

very active at Horrocleave's. He not only designed shapes for vases,

and talked intimately with Jim Horrocleave about fresh projects, but

he controlled the petty cash. The expenditure of petty cash grew, as

was natural in a growing business. Mr. Horrocleave soon got accustomed

to that, and apparently gave it no thought, signing cheques instantly

upon request. But on the very day of Mrs. Maldon's party, after

signing a cheque and before handing it to Louis, he had somewhat

lengthily consulted his private cash-book, and, as he handed over

the cheque, had said: "Let's have a squint at the petty-cash book

to-morrow morning, Louis." He said it gruffly, but he was a gruff man.

He left early. He might have meant anything or nothing. Louis could

not decide which; or rather, from five o'clock to seven he had come to

alternating decisions every five minutes.

II
It was just about at the time when Louis ought to have been removing

his paper cuff-shields in order to start for Mrs. Maldon's that he

discovered the full extent of his debt to the petty-cash box. He

sat alone at a rough and dirty desk in the inner room of the works

"office," surrounded by dust-covered sample vases and other vessels of

all shapes, sizes, and tints—specimens of Horrocleave's "Art Lustre

Ware," a melancholy array of ingenious ugliness that nevertheless

filled with pride its creators. He looked through a dirt-obscured

window and with unseeing gaze surveyed a muddy, littered quadrangle

whose twilight was reddened by gleams from the engine-house. In this

yard lay flat a sign that had been blown down from the façade of the

manufactory six months before: "Horrocleave. Art Lustre Ware."

Within the room was another sign, itself fashioned in lustre-ware:

"Horrocleave. Art Lustre Ware." And the envelopes and paper and

bill-heads on the desk all bore the same legend: "Horrocleave. Art

Lustre Ware."
He owed seventy-three pounds to the petty-cash box, and he was

startled and shocked. He was startled because for weeks past he had

refrained from adding up the columns of the cash-book—partly from

idleness and partly from a desire to remain in ignorance of his own

doings. He had hoped for the best. He had faintly hoped that the

deficit would not exceed ten pounds, or twelve; he had been prepared

for a deficit of twenty-five, or even thirty. But seventy-three really

shocked. Nay, it staggered. It meant that in addition to his salary,

some thirty shillings a week had been mysteriously trickling through

the incurable hole in his pocket. Not to mention other debts! He well

knew that to Shillitoe alone (his admirable tailor) he owed eighteen

pounds.
It may be asked how a young bachelor, with private means and a

fine salary, living in a district where prices are low and social

conventions not costly, could have come to such a pass. The answer is

that Louis had no private means, and that his salary was not fine. The

thousand pounds had gradually vanished, as a thousand pounds will, in

the refinements of material existence and in the pursuit of happiness.

His bank-account had long been in abeyance. His salary was three

pounds a week. Many a member of the liberal professions—many a

solicitor, for example—brings up a family on three pounds a week in

the provinces. But for a Lieutenant-General's nephew, who had once had

a thousand pounds in one lump, three pounds a week was inadequate. As

a fact, Louis conceived himself "Art Director" of Horrocleave's, and

sincerely thought that as such he was ill-paid. Herein was one of his

private excuses for eccentricity with the petty cash. It may also be

asked what Louis had to show for his superb expenditure. The answer

is, nothing.
With the seventy-three pounds desolatingly clear in his mind, he

quitted his desk in order to reconnoitre the outer and larger portion

of the counting-house. He went as far as the archway, and saw black

smoke being blown downwards from heaven into Friendly Street. A

policeman was placidly regarding the smoke as he strolled by. And

Louis, though absolutely sure that the officer would not carry out his

plain duty of summoning Horrocleave's for committing a smoke-nuisance,

did not care for the spectacle of the policeman. He returned to the

inner office, and locked the door. The "staff" and the "hands" had all

gone, save one or two piece-workers in the painting-shop across the

yard.
The night watchman, fresh from bed, was moving fussily about the yard.

He nodded with respect to Louis through the grimy window. Louis lit

the gas, and spread a newspaper in front of the window by way of

blind. And then he began a series of acts on the petty-cash book. The

office clock indicated twenty past six. He knew that time was short,

but he had a natural gift for the invention and execution of these

acts, and he calculated that under half an hour would suffice

for them. But when he next looked at the clock, the acts being

accomplished, one hour had elapsed; it had seemed to him more like a

quarter of an hour. Yet as blotting-paper cannot safely be employed in

such delicate calligraphic feats as those of Louis', even an hour was

not excessive for what he had done. An operator clumsier, less cool,

less cursory, more cautious than himself might well have spent half a

night over the job. He locked up the book, washed his hands and face

with remarkable celerity in a filthy lavatory basin, brushed his hair,

removed his cuff-shields, changed his coat, and fled at speed, leaving

the key of the office with the watchman.

III
"I suppose the old lady was getting anxious?" said he brightly (but

in a low tone so that the old lady should not hear), as he shook hands

with Rachel in the lobby. He had recognized her in front of him up the

lane—had, in fact, nearly overtaken her; and she was standing at the

open door when he mounted the steps. She had had just time to prove

to Mrs. Maldon, by a "He's coming" thrown through the sitting-room

doorway, that she had not waited for Louis Fores and walked up with

him.
"Yes," Rachel replied in the same tone, most deceitfully leaving him

under the false impression that it was the old lady's anxiety that had

sent her out. She had, then, emerged scathless in reputation from the

indiscreet adventure!
The house was animated by the arrival of Louis; at once it seemed to

live more keenly when he had crossed the threshold. And Louis found

pleasure in the house—in the welcoming aspect of its interior, in

Rachel's evident excited gladness at seeing him, in her honest and

agreeable features, and in her sheer girlishness. A few minutes

earlier he had been in the sordid and dreadful office. Now he was in

another and a cleaner, prettier world. He yielded instantly and fully

to its invitation, for he had the singular faculty of being able to

cast off care like a garment. He felt sympathetic towards women, and

eager to employ for their contentment all the charm which he knew

he possessed. He gave himself, generously, in every gesture and

intonation.
"Office, auntie, office!" he exclaimed, elegantly entering the

parlour. "Sack-cloth! Ashes! Hallo! where's Julian? Is he late too?"
When he had received the news about Julian Maldon he asked to see

the telegram, and searched out its place of origin, and drew forth

a pocket time-table, and remarked in a wise way that he hoped Julian

would "make the connection" at Derby. Lastly he predicted the precise

minute at which Julian "ought" to be knocking at the front door. And

both women felt their ignorant, puzzled inferiority in these recondite

matters of travel, and the comfort of having an omniscient male in the

house.
Then slightly drawing up his dark blue trousers with an accustomed

movement, he carefully sat down on the Chesterfield, and stroked

his soft black moustache (which was estimably long for a fellow of

twenty-three) and patted his black hair.
"Rachel, you didn't fasten that landing window, after all!" said Mrs.

Maldon, looking over Louis' head at the lady companion, who hesitated

modestly near the door. "I've tried, but I couldn't."
"Neither could I, Mrs. Maldon," said Rachel. "I was thinking perhaps

Mr. Fores wouldn't mind—"
She did not explain that her failure to fasten the window had been

more or less deliberate, since, while actually tugging at the window,

she had been visited by the sudden delicious thought: "How nice it

would be to ask Louis Fores to do this hard thing for me!"
And now she had asked him.
"Certainly!" Louis jumped to his feet, and off he went upstairs.

Most probably, if the sudden delicious thought had not skipped into

Rachel's brain, he would never have made that critical ascent to the

first floor.
A gas-jet burned low on the landing.
"Let's have a little light on the subject," he cheerfully muttered to

himself, as he turned on the gas to the full.
Then in the noisy blaze of yellow and blue light he went to the window

and with a single fierce wrench he succeeded in pulling the catch into

position. He was proud of his strength. It pleased him to think of the

weakness of women; it pleased him to anticipate the impressed thanks

of the weak women for this exertion of his power on their behalf.

"Have you managed it so soon?" his aunt would exclaim, and he would

answer in a carefully offhand way, "Of course. Why not?"
He was about to descend, but he remembered that he must not leave the

gas at full. With his hand on the tap, he glanced perfunctorily around

the little landing. The door of Mrs. Maldon's bedroom was in front of

him, at right angles to the window. By the door, which was ajar,

stood a cane-seated chair. Underneath the chair he perceived a whitish

package or roll that seemed to be out of place there on the floor. He

stooped and picked it up. And as the paper rustled peculiarly in his

hand, he could feel his heart give a swift bound. He opened the roll.

It consisted of nothing whatever but bank-notes. He listened intently,

with ear cocked and rigid limbs, and he could just catch the soothing

murmur of women's voices in the parlour beneath the reverberating,

solemn pulse of the lobby clock.

IV
Louis Fores had been intoxicated into a condition of poesy. He was

deliciously incapable of any precise thinking; he could not formulate

any theory to account for the startling phenomenon of a roll of

bank-notes loose under a chair on a first-floor landing of his

great-aunt's house; he could not even estimate the value of the

roll—he felt only that it was indefinitely prodigious. But he had the

most sensitive appreciation of the exquisite beauty of those pieces of

paper. They were not merely beautiful because they stood for delight

and indulgence, raising lovely visions of hosiers' and jewellers'

shops and the night interiors of clubs and restaurants—raising one

clear vision of himself clasping a watch-bracelet on the soft arm of

Rachel who had so excitingly smiled upon him a moment ago. They were

beautiful in themselves; the aspect and very texture of them were

beautiful—surpassing pictures and fine scenery. They were the most

poetic things in the world. They transfigured the narrow, gaslit

first-floor landing of his great-aunt's house into a secret and

unearthly grove of bliss. He was drunk with quivering emotion.
And then, as he gazed at the divine characters printed in sable on the

rustling whiteness, he was aware of a stab of ugly, coarse pain. Up to

the instant of beholding those bank-notes he had been convinced that

his operations upon the petty-cash book would be entirely successful

and that the immediate future of Horrocleave's was assured of

tranquillity; he had been blandly certain that Horrocleave held no

horrid suspicion against him, and that even if Horrocleave's pate

did conceal a dark thought, it would be conjured at once away by the

superficial reasonableness of the falsified accounts. But now his mind

was terribly and inexplicably changed, and it seemed to him impossible

to gull the acute and mighty Horrocleave. Failure, exposure, disgrace,

ruin, seemed inevitable—and also intolerable. It was astonishing

that he should have deceived himself into an absurd security. The

bank-notes, by some magic virtue which they possessed, had opened

his eyes to the truth. And they presented themselves as absolutely

indispensable to him. They had sprung from naught, they belonged

to nobody, they existed without a creative cause in the material

world—and they were indispensable to him! Could it be conceived that

he should lose his high and brilliant position in the town, that two

policemen should hustle him into the black van, that the gates of

a prison should clang behind him? It could not be conceived. It was

monstrously inconceivable.... The bank-notes ... he saw them wavy, as

through a layer of hot air.
A heavy knock on the front door below shook him and the floor and the

walls. He heard the hurried feet of Rachel, the opening of the door,

and Julian's harsh, hoarse voice. Julian, then, was not quite an hour

late, after all. The stir in the lobby seemed to be enormous, and very

close to him; Mrs. Maldon had come forth from the parlour to greet

Julian on his birthday.... Louis stuck the bank-notes into the side

pocket of his coat. And as it were automatically his mood underwent a

change, violent and complete. "I'll teach the old lady to drop notes

all over the place," he said to himself. "I'll just teach her!" And

he pictured his triumph as a wise male when, during the course of the

feast, his great-aunt should stumble on her loss and yield to senile

feminine agitation, and he should remark superiorly, with elaborate

calm: "Here is your precious money, auntie. A good thing it was I and

not burglars who discovered it. Let this be a lesson to you!... Where

was it? It was on the landing carpet, if you please! That's where it

was!" And the nice old creature's pathetic relief!
As he went jauntily downstairs there remained nothing of his mood of

intoxication except a still thumping heart.

CHAPTER III
THE FEAST

I
The dramatic moment of the birthday feast came nearly at the end of

the meal when Mrs. Maldon, having in mysterious silence disappeared

for a space to the room behind, returned with due pomp bearing a

parcel in her dignified hands. During her brief absence Louis, Rachel,

and Julian—hero of the night—had sat mute and somewhat constrained

round the debris of the birthday pudding. The constraint was no doubt

due partly to Julian's characteristic and notorious grim temper, and

partly to mere anticipation of a solemn event.
Julian Maldon in particular was self-conscious. He hated intensely

to be self-conscious, and his feeling towards every witness of his

self-consciousness partook always of the homicidal. Were it not

that civilization has the means to protect itself, Julian might have

murdered defenceless aged ladies and innocent young girls for the

simple offence of having seen him blush.
He was a perfect specimen of a throw-back to original ancestry. He had

been born in London, of an American mother, and had spent the greater

part of his life in London. Yet London and his mother seemed to

count for absolutely nothing at all in his composition. At the age of

seventeen his soul, quitting the exile of London, had come to the

Five Towns with a sigh of relief as if at the assuagement of a long

nostalgia, and had dropped into the district as into a socket. In

three months he was more indigenous than a native. Any experienced

observer who now chanced at a week-end to see him board the Manchester

express at Euston would have been able to predict from his appearance

that he would leave the train at Knype. He was an undersized man, with

a combative and suspicious face. He regarded the world with crafty

pugnacity from beneath frowning eyebrows. His expression said: "Woe

betide the being who tries to get the better of me!" His expression

said: "Keep off!" His expression said: "I am that I am. Take me

or leave me, but preferably leave me. I loathe fuss, pretence,

flourishes—any and every form of damned nonsense."
He had an excellent heart, but his attitude towards it was the

attitude of his great-grandmother towards her front parlour—he used

it as little as possible, and kept it locked up like a shame. In

brief, he was more than a bit of a boor. And boorishness being his

chief fault, he was quite naturally proud of it, counted it for

the finest of all qualities, and scorned every manifestation of its

opposite. To prove his inward sincerity he deemed it right to flout

any form of external grace—such as politeness, neatness, elegance,

compliments, small-talk, smooth words, and all ceremonial whatever. He

would have died in torment sooner than kiss. He was averse even from

shaking hands, and when he did shake hands he produced a carpenter's

vice, crushed flesh and bone together, and flung the intruding pulp

away. His hat was so heavy on his head that only by an exhausting

and supreme effort could he raise it to a woman, and after the odious

accident he would feel as humiliated as a fox-terrier after a bath. By

the kind hazard of fate he had never once encountered his great-aunt

in the street. He was superb in enmity—a true hero. He would quarrel

with a fellow and say, curtly, "I'll never speak to you again"; and

he never would speak to that fellow again. Were the last trump to blow

and all the British Isles to be submerged save the summit of Snowdon,

and he and that fellow to find themselves alone and safe together on

the peak, he could still be relied upon never to speak to that fellow

again. Thus would he prove that he was a man of his word and that

there was no nonsense about him.
Strange though it may appear to the thoughtless, he was not

disliked—much less ostracised. Codes differ. He conformed to one

which suited the instincts of some thirty thousand other adult

males in the Five Towns. Two strapping girls in the warehouse of

his manufactory at Knype quarrelled over him in secret as the Prince

Charming of those parts. Yet he had never addressed them except to

inform them that if they didn't mind their p's and q's he would have

them flung off the "bank" [manufactory]. Rachel herself had not yet

begun to be prejudiced against him.
This monster of irascible cruelty regarded himself as a middle-aged

person. But he was only twenty-five that day, and he did not look

more, either, despite a stiff, strong moustache. He too, like Louis

and Rachel, had the gestures of youth—the unconsidered, lithe

movements of limb, the wistful, unteachable pride of his age, the

touching self-confidence. Old Mrs. Maldon was indeed old among them.

II
She sat down in all her benevolent stateliness and with a slightly

irritating deliberation undid the parcel, displaying a flattish

leather case about seven inches by four, which she handed formally to

Julian Maldon, saying as she did so—
"From your old auntie, my dear boy, with her loving wishes. You have

now lived just a quarter of a century."
And as Julian, awkwardly grinning, fumbled with the spring-catch of

the case, she was aware of having accomplished a great and noble act

of surrender. She hoped the best from it. In particular, she hoped

that she had saved the honour of her party and put it at last on a

secure footing of urbane convivial success. For that a party of hers

should fail in giving pleasure to every member of it was a menace to

her legitimate pride. And so far fate had not been propitious. The

money in the house had been, and was, on her mind. Then the lateness

of the guests had disturbed her. And then Julian had aggrieved her by

a piece of obstinacy very like himself. Arriving straight from a train

journey, he had wanted to wash. But he would not go to the specially

prepared bedroom, where a perfect apparatus awaited him. No, he must

needs take off his jacket in the back room and roll up his sleeves and

stamp into the scullery and there splash and rub like a stableman, and

wipe himself on the common rough roller-towel. He said he preferred

the "sink." (Offensive word! He would not even say "slop-stone," which

was the proper word. He said "sink," and again "sink.")
And then, when the meal finally did begin Mrs. Maldon's serviette

and silver serviette-ring had vanished. Impossible to find them! Mr.

Batchgrew had of course horribly disarranged the table, and in the

upset the serviette and ring might have fallen unnoticed into the

darkness beneath the table. But no search could discover them. Had

the serviette and ring ever been on the table at all? Had Rachael

perchance forgotten them? Rachael was certain that she had put them

on the table. She remembered casting away a soiled serviette and

replacing it with a clean one in accordance with Mrs. Maldon's command

for the high occasion. She produced the soiled serviette in proof.

Moreover, the ring was not in the serviette drawer of the sideboard.

Renewed search was equally sterile.... At one moment Mrs. Maldon

thought that she herself had seen the serviette and ring on the

table early in the evening; but at the next she thought she had not.

Conceivably Mr. Batchgrew had taken them in mistake. Yes, assuredly,

he had taken them in mistake—somehow! And yet it was inconceivable

that he had taken a serviette and ring in mistake. In mistake for

what? No!...
Mystery! Excessively disconcerting for an old lady! In the end Rachel

provided another clean serviette, and the meal commenced. But Mrs.

Maldon had not been able to "settle down" in an instant. The wise,

pitying creatures in their twenties considered that it was absurd for

her to worry herself about such a trifle. But was it a trifle? It was

rather a denial of natural laws, a sinister miracle. Serviette-rings

cannot walk, nor fly, nor be annihilated. And further, she had used

that serviette-ring for more than twenty years. However, the hostess

in her soon triumphed over the foolish old lady, and taken the head of

the board with aplomb.
And indeed aplomb had been required. For the guests behaved

strangely—unless it was that the hostess was in a nervous mood for

fancying trouble! Julian Maldon was fidgety and preoccupied. And Louis

himself—usually a model guest—was also fidgety and preoccupied. As

for Rachel, the poor girl had only too obviously lost her head about

Louis. Mrs. Maldon had never seen anything like it, never!

III
Julian, having opened the case, disclosed twin brier pipes,

silver-mounted, with alternative stems of various lengths and diverse

mouthpieces—all reposing on soft couches of fawn-tinted stuff, with

a crimson, silk-lined lid to serve them for canopy. A rich and costly

array! Everybody was impressed, even startled. For not merely was the

gift extremely handsome—it was more than a gift; it symbolized the

end of an epoch in those lives. Mrs. Maldon had been no friend of

tobacco. She had lukewarmly permitted cigarettes, which Louis smoked,

smoking naught else. But cigars she had discouraged, and pipes she

simply would not have! Now, Julian smoked nothing but a pipe. Hence

in his great-aunt's parlour he had not smoked; in effect he had been

forbidden to smoke there. The theory that a pipe was vulgar had been

stiffly maintained in that sacred parlour. In the light of these facts

did not Mrs. Maldon's gift indeed shine as a great and noble act

of surrender? Was it not more than a gift, and entitled to stagger

beholders? Was it not a sublime proof that the earth revolves and the

world moves?
Mrs. Maldon was as susceptible as any one to the drama of the moment,

perhaps more than any one. She thrilled and became happy as Julian

in silence minutely examined the pipes. She had taken expert advice

before purchasing, and she was tranquil as to the ability of the pipes

to withstand criticism. They bore the magic triple initials of the

first firm of brier-pipe makers in the world—initials as famous and

as welcome on the plains of Hindustan as in the Home Counties or the

frozen zone. She gazed round the table with increasing satisfaction.

Louis, who was awkwardly fixed with regard to the light, the shadow

of his bust falling always across his plate, had borne that real

annoyance with the most charming good-humour. He was a delight to the

eye; he had excellent qualities, especially social qualities. Rachel

sat opposite to the hostess—an admirable girl in most ways,

a splendid companion, and a sound cook. The meal had been

irreproachable, and in the phrase of the Signal "ample justice

had been done" to it. Julian was on the hostess's left, with his

back to the window and to the draught. A good boy, a sterling boy, if

peculiar! And there they were all close together, intimate, familiar,

mutually respecting; and the perfect parlour was round about them: a

domestic organism, honest, dignified, worthy, more than comfortable.

And she, Elizabeth Maldon, in her old age, was the head of it, and the

fount of good things.
"Thank ye!" ejaculated Julian, with a queer look askance at his

benefactor. "Thank ye, aunt!"
It was all he could get out of his throat, and it was all that was

expected of him. He hated to give thanks—and he hated to be thanked.

The grandeur of the present flattered him. Nevertheless he regarded it

as essentially absurd in its pretentiousness. The pipes were A1, but

could a man carry about a huge contraption like that? All a man needed

was an A1 pipe, which, if he had any sense, he would carry loose in

his pocket with his pouch—and be hanged to morocco cases and silk

linings!
"Stoke up, my hearties!" said Louis, drawing forth a gun-metal

cigarette-case, which was chained to his person by a kind of cable.
Undoubtedly the case of pipes represented for Julian a triumph over

Louis, or, at least, justice against Louis. For obvious reasons Julian

had not quarrelled with a rich and affectionate great-aunt because she

had accorded to Louis the privilege of smoking in her parlour what he

preferred to smoke, while refusing a similar privilege to himself. But

he had resented the distinction. And his joy in the spectacular turn

of the wheel was vast. For that very reason he hid it with much care.

Why should he bubble over with gratitude for having been at last

treated fairly? It would be pitiful to do so. Leaving the case open

upon the table, he pulled a pouch and an old pipe from his pocket, and

began to fill the pipe. It was inexcusable, but it was like him—he

had to do it.
"But aren't you going to try one of the new ones?" asked Mrs. Maldon,

amiably but uncertainly.
"No," said he, with cold nonchalance. Upon nobody in the world had

the sweet magic of Mrs. Maldon's demeanour less influence than upon

himself. "Not now. I want to enjoy my smoke, and the first smoke out

of a new pipe is never any good."
It was very true, but far more wanton than true. Mrs. Maldon in her

ignorance could not appreciate the truth, but she could appreciate its

wantonness. She was wounded—silly, touchy old thing! She was wounded,

and she hid the wound.
Rachel flushed with ire against the boor.
"By the way," Mrs. Maldon remarked in a light, indifferent tone,

just as though the glory of the moment had not been suddenly rent and

shrivelled. "I didn't see your portmanteau in the back room just now,

Julian. Has any one carried it upstairs? I didn't hear any one go

upstairs."
"I didn't bring one, aunt," said Julian.
"Not bring—"
"I was forgetting to tell ye. I can't sleep here to-night. I'm off to

South Africa to-morrow, and I've got a lot of things to fix up at my

digs to-night." He lit the old pipe from a match which Louis passed to

him.
"To South Africa?" murmured Mrs. Maldon, aghast. And she repeated,

"South Africa?" To her it was an incredible distance. It was not

a place—it was something on the map. Perhaps she had never

imaginatively realized that actual people did in fact go to South

Africa. "But this is the first I have heard of this!" she said.

Julian's extraordinary secretiveness always disturbed her.
"I only got the telegram about my berth this morning," said Julian,

rather sullenly on the defensive.
"Is it business?" Mrs. Maldon asked.
"You may depend it isn't pleasure, aunt," he answered, and shut his

lips tight on the pipe.
After a pause Mrs. Maldon tried again.
"Where do you sail from?"
Julian answered—
"Southampton."
There was another pause. Louis and Rachel exchanged a glance of

sympathetic dismay at the situation.
Mrs. Maldon then smiled with plaintive courage.
"Of course if you can't sleep here, you can't," said she benignly. "I

can see that. But we were quite counting on having a man in the house

to-night—with all these burglars about—weren't we, Rachel?" Her

grimace became, by an effort, semi-humorous.
Rachel diplomatically echoed the tone of Mrs. Maldon, but more

brightly, with a more frankly humorous smile—
"We were, indeed!"
But her smile was a masterpiece of duplicity, somewhat strange in a

girl so downright; for beneath it burned hotly her anger against the

brute Julian.
"Well, there it is!" Julian gruffly and callously summed up the

situation, staring at the inside of his teacup.
"Propitious moment for getting a monopoly of door-knobs at the Cape, I

suppose?" said Louis quizzically. His cousin manufactured, among other

articles, white and jet door-knobs.
"No need for you to be so desperately funny!" snapped Julian, who

detested Louis' brand of facetiousness. It was the word "propitious"

that somehow annoyed him—it had a sarcastic flavour, and it was

"Louis all over."
"No offence, old man!" Louis magnanimously soothed him. "On the

contrary, many happy returns of the day." In social intercourse

the younger cousin's good-humour and suavity were practically

indestructible.
But Julian still scowled.
Rachel, to make a tactful diversion, rose and began to collect plates.

The meal was at an end, and for Mrs. Maldon it had closed in ignominy.

From her quarter of the table she pushed crockery towards Rachel with

a gesture of disillusion; the courage to smile had been but momentary.

She felt old—older than she had ever felt before. The young

generation presented themselves to her as almost completely enigmatic.

She admitted that they were foreign to her, that she could not

comprehend them at all. Each of the three at her table was entirely

free and independent—each could and did act according to his or her

whim, and none could say them nay. Such freedom seemed unreal. They

were children playing at life, and playing dangerously. Hundreds of

times, in conversation with her coevals, she had cheerfully protested

against the banal complaint that the world had changed of late years.

But now she felt grievously that the world was different—that it

had indeed deteriorated since her young days. She was fatigued by the

modes of thought of these youngsters, as a nurse or mother is fatigued

by too long a spell of the shrillness and the naïveté of a

family of infants. She wanted repose.... Was it conceivable that when,

with incontestable large-mindedness, she had given a case of pipes to

Julian, he should first put a slight on her gift and then, brusquely

leaving her in the lurch, announce his departure for South Africa,

with as much calm as though South Africa were in the next street?...

And the other two were guilty in other ways, perhaps more subtly, of

treason against forlorn old age.
And then Louis, in taking the slop-basin from her trembling

fingers, to pass it to Rachel, gave her one of his adorable, candid,

persuasive, sympathetic smiles. And lo! she was enheartened once more.

And she remembered that dignity and kindliness had been the watchwords

of her whole life, and that it would be shameful to relinquish the

struggle for an ideal at the very threshold of the grave. She began to

find excuses for Julian. The dear lad must have many business worries.

He was very young to be at the head of a manufacturing concern. He had

a remarkable brain—worthy of the family. Allowances must be made for

him. She must not be selfish.... And assuredly that serviette and ring

would reappear on the morrow.
"I'll take that out," said Louis, indicating the tray which Rachel

had drawn from concealment under the Chesterfield, and which was

now loaded. Mrs. Maldon employed an old and valued charwoman in the

mornings. Rachel accomplished all the rest of the housework herself,

including cookery, and she accomplished it with the stylistic

smartness of a self-respecting lady-help.
"Oh no!" said she. "I can carry it quite easily, thanks."
Louis insisted masculinely—
"I'll take that tray out."
And he took it out, holding his head back as he marched, so that the

smoke of the cigarette between his lips should not obscure his eyes.

Rachel followed with some oddments. Behold those two away together in

the seclusion of the kitchen; and Mrs. Maldon and Julian alone in the

parlour!
"Very fine!" muttered Julian, fingering the magnificent case of pipes.

Now that there were fewer spectators, his tongue was looser, and he

could relent.
"I'm so glad you like it," Mrs. Maldon responded eagerly.
The world was brighter to her, and she accepted Julian's amiability as

Heaven's reward for her renewal of courage.

IV
"Auntie-" began Louis, with a certain formality.
"Yes?"
Mrs. Maldon had turned her chair a little towards the fire. The two

visitants to the kitchen had reappeared. Rachel with a sickle-shaped

tool was sedulously brushing the crumbs from the damask into a silver

tray. Louis had taken the poker to mend the fire.
He said, nonchalantly—
"If you'd care for me to stay the night here instead of Julian, I

will."
"Well—" Mrs. Maldon was unprepared for this apparently quite natural

and kindly suggestion. It perturbed, even frightened her by its

implications. Had it been planned in the kitchen between those two?

She wanted to accept it; and yet another instinct in her prompted her

to decline it absolutely and at once. She saw Rachel flushing as the

girl industriously continued her task without looking up. To Mrs.

Maldon it seemed that those two, under the impulsion of Fate, were

rushing towards each other at a speed far greater than she had

suspected.
Julian stirred on his chair, under the sharp irritation caused

by Louis' proposal. He despised Louis as a boy of no ambition—a

butterfly being who had got no farther than the adolescent

will-to-live, the desire for self-indulgence, whereas he, Julian, was

profoundly conscious of the will-to-dominate, the hunger for influence

and power. And also he was jealous of Louis on various counts.

Louis had come to the Five Towns years after Julian, and had almost

immediately cut a figure therein; Julian had never cut a figure.

Julian had been the sole resident great-nephew of a benevolent aunt,

and Louis had arrived and usurped at least half the advantages of the

relationship, if not more; Louis lived several miles nearer to his

aunt. Julian it was who, through his acquaintance with Rachel's father

and her masterful sinister brother, had brought her into touch with

Mrs. Maldon. Rachel was Julian's creation, so far as his aunt was

concerned. Julian had no dislike for Rachel; he had even been thinking

of her favourably. But Louis had, as it were, appropriated her ...

From the steely conning-tower of his brows Julian had caught their

private glances at the table. And Louis was now carrying trays for

her, and hobnobbing with her in the kitchen! Lastly, because Julian

could not pass the night in the house, Louis, the interloper, had the

effrontery to offer to fill his place—on some preposterous excuse

about burglars! And the fellow was so polite and so persuasive, with

his finicking eloquence. By virtue of a strange faculty not uncommon

in human nature Julian loathed Louis' good manners and appearance—and

acutely envied them.
He burst out with scarcely controlled savagery—
"A lot of good you'd be with burglars!"
The women were outraged by his really shocking rudeness. Rachel bit

her lip and began to fold up the cloth. Mrs. Maldon's head slightly

trembled. Louis alone maintained a perfect equanimity. It was as if he

were invulnerable.
"You never know!" he smiled amiably, and shrugged his shoulders. Then

he finished his operation on the fire.
"I'm sure it's very kind and thoughtful of you, Louis," said Mrs.

Maldon, driven to acceptance by Julian's monstrous behaviour.
"Moreover," Louis urbanely continued, smoothing down his trousers

with a long perpendicular caress as he usually did after any

bending—"moreover, there's always my revolver."
He gave a short laugh.
"Revolver!" exclaimed Mrs. Maldon, intimidated by the mere name. Then

she smiled, in an effort to reassure herself. "Louis, you are a tease.

You really shouldn't tease me."
"I'm not," said Louis, with that careful air of false blank

casualness which he would invariably employ for his more breath-taking

announcements. "I always carry a loaded revolver."
The fearful word "loaded" sank into the heart of the old woman, and

thrilled her. It was a fact that for some weeks past Louis had been

carrying a revolver. At intervals the craze for firearms seizes the

fashionable youth of a provincial town, like the craze for marbles

at school, and then dies away. In the present instance it had been

originated by the misadventure of a dandy with an out-of-work artisan

on the fringe of Hanbridge. Nothing could be more correct than for

a man of spirit and fashion thus to arm himself in order to cow the

lower orders and so cope with the threatened social revolution.
"You don't, Louis!" Mrs. Maldon deprecated.
"I'll show you," said Louis, feeling in his hip pocket.
"Please!" protested Mrs. Maldon, and Rachel covered her face

with her hands and drew back from Louis' sinister gesture. "Please

don't show it to us!" Mrs. Maiden's tone was one of imploring

entreaty. For an instant she was just like a sentimentalist who

resents and is afraid of hearing the truth. She obscurely thought that

if she resolutely refused to see the revolver it would somehow cease

to exist. With a loaded revolver in the house the situation seemed

more dangerous and more complicated than ever. There was something

absolutely terrifying in the conjuncture of a loaded revolver and a

secret hoard of bank-notes.
"All right! All right!" Louis relented.
Julian cut across the scene with a gruff and final—
"I must clear out of this!"
He rose.
"Must you?" said his aunt.
She did not unduly urge him to delay, for the strain of family life

was exhausting her.
"I must catch the 9.48," said Julian, looking at the clock and at his

watch.
Herein was yet another example of the morbid reticence which so pained

Mrs. Maldon. He must have long before determined to catch the 9.48;

yet he had said nothing about it till the last moment! He had said

nothing even about South Africa until the news was forced from him. It

had been arranged that he should come direct to Bursley station from

his commercial journey in Yorkshire and Derbyshire, pass the night at

his aunt's house, which was conveniently near the station, and proceed

refreshed to business on the morrow. A neat arrangement, well suiting

the fact of his birthday! And now he had broken it in silence, without

a warning, with the baldest possible explanation! His aunt, despite

her real interest in him, could never extract from him a clear account

of his doings and his movements. And this South African excursion was

the last and worst illustration of his wilful cruel harshness to her.
Nevertheless, the extreme and unimaginable remoteness of South Africa

seemed to demand a special high formality in bidding him adieu, and

she rendered it. If he would not permit her to superintend his packing

(he had never even let her come to his rooms!), she could at least

superintend the putting on of his overcoat. And she did. And instead

of quitting him as usual at the door of the parlour, she insisted on

going to the front door and opening it herself. She was on her mettle.

She was majestic and magnificent. By refusing to see his ill-breeding

she actually did terminate its existence. She stood at the open front

door with the three young ones about her, and by the force of her

ideal the front door became the portal of an embassy and Julian's

departure a ceremony of state. He had to shake hands all round. She

raised her cheek, and he had to kiss. She said, "God bless you!" and

he had to say, "Thank you."
As he was descending the outer steps, the pipe-case clipped under his

arm, Louis threw at him—
"I say, old man!"
"What?" He turned round with sharp defiance beneath the light of the

street-lamp.
"How are you going to get to London to-morrow morning in time for the

boat-train at Waterloo, if you're staying at Knype to-night."
Louis travelled little, but it was his foible to be learned in

boat-trains and "connections."
"A friend o' mine's motoring me to Stafford at five to-morrow morning,

if you want to know. I shall catch the Scotch express. Anything else?"
"Oh!" muttered Louis, checked.
Julian clanked the gate and vanished up the street, Mrs. Maldon

waving.
"What friend? What motor?" reflected Mrs. Maldon sadly. "He is

incorrigible with his secretiveness."
"Mrs. Maldon," said Rachel anxiously, "you look pale. Is it being in

this draught?" She shut the door.
Mrs. Maldon sighed and moved away. She hesitated at the parlour door

and then said—
"I must go upstairs a moment."

CHAPTER IV
IN THE NIGHT

I
Louis stood hesitant and slightly impatient in the parlour, alone. A

dark blue cloth now covered the table, and in the centre of it was

a large copper jar containing an evergreen plant. Of the feast no

material trace remained except a few crumbs on the floor. But the room

was still pervaded by the emotional effluence of the perturbed souls

who had just gone; and Louis felt it, though without understanding.
Throughout the evening he had of course been preoccupied by the

consciousness of having in his pocket bank-notes to a value unknown.

Several times he had sought for a suitable opportunity to disclose his

exciting secret. But he had found none. In practice he could not say

to his aunt, before Julian and Rachel: "Auntie, I picked up a lot of

bank-notes on the landing. You really ought to be more careful!" He

could not even in any way refer to them. The dignity of Mrs. Maldon

had intimidated him. He had decided, after Julian's announcement

of departure, that he would hand them over to her, simply and

undramatically and with no triumphant air, as soon as he and she

should for a moment be alone together. Then Mrs. Maldon vanished

upstairs. And she had not returned. Rachel also had vanished. And he

was waiting.
He desired to examine the notes, to let his eyes luxuriously rest upon

them, but he dared not take them from his pocket lest one or other of

the silent-footed women might surprise him by a sudden entrance. He

fingered them as they lay in their covert, and the mere feel of them,

raised exquisite images in his mind; and at the same time the whole

room and every object in the room was transformed into a secret

witness which spied upon him, disquieted him, and warned him. But

the fact that the notes were intact, that nothing irremediable had

occurred, reassured him and gave him strength, so that he could defy

the suspicions of those senseless surrounding objects.
Within the room there was no sound but the faint regular hiss of the

gas and an occasional falling together of coal in the weakening fire.

Overhead, from his aunt's bedroom, vague movements were perceptible.

Then these ceased, absolutely. The tension, increasing, grew too much

for him, and with a curt gesture, and a self-conscious expression

between a smile and a frown, he left the parlour and stood to listen

in the lobby. Not for several seconds did he notice the heavy ticking

of the clock, close to his ear, nor the chill draught that came under

the front door. He gazed up into the obscurity at the top of the

stairs. The red glow of the kitchen fire, in the distance to the right

of the stairs, caught his attention at intervals. He was obsessed,

almost overpowered, by the mysteriousness of the first floor. What had

happened? What was happening? And suddenly an explanation swept into

his brain—the obvious explanation. His aunt had missed the bank-notes

and was probably at that very instant working herself into an anguish.

What ought he to do? Should he run up and knock at her door? He was

spared a decision by the semi-miraculous appearance of Rachel at the

top of the stairs. She started.
"Oh! How you frightened me!" she exclaimed in a low voice.
He answered weakly, charmingly—
"Did I?"
"Will you please come and speak to Mrs. Maldon? She wants you."
"In her room?"
Rachel nodded and disappeared before he could ask another question.

With heart beating he ascended the stairs by twos. Through the

half-open door of the faintly lit room which he himself would occupy

he could hear Rachel active. And then he was at the closed door of his

aunt's room. "I must be jolly careful how I do it!" he thought as he

knocked.

II
He was surprised, and impressed, to see Mrs. Maldon in bed. She lay

on her back, with her striking head raised high on several pillows.

Nothing else of her was visible; the purple eider-down covered the

whole bed without a crease.
"Hello, auntie!" he greeted her, instinctively modifying his voice to

the soft gentleness proper to the ordered and solemn chamber.
Mrs. Maldon, moving her head, looked at him in silence. He tiptoed to

the foot of the bed and leaned on it gracefully. And as in the parlour

his shadow had fallen on the table, so now, with the gas just

behind him, it fell on the bed. The room was chilly and had a slight

pharmaceutical odour.
Mrs. Maldon said, with a weak effort—
"I was feeling faint, and Rachel thought I'd better get straight to

bed. I'm an old woman, Louis."
"She hasn't missed them!" he thought in a flash, and said, aloud—
"Nothing of the sort, auntie."
He was aware of the dim reflection of himself in the mirror of the

immense Victorian mahogany wardrobe to his left.
Mrs. Maldon again hesitated before speaking.
"You aren't ill, are you, auntie?" he said in a cheerful, friendly

whisper. He was touched by the poignant pathos of her great age and

her debility. It rent his heart to think that she had no prospect but

the grave.
She murmured, ignoring his question—
"I just wanted to tell you that you needn't go down home for your

night things—unless you specially want to, that is. I have all that's

necessary here, and I've given orders to Rachel."
"Certainly, auntie. I won't leave the house. That's all right."
No, she assuredly had not missed the notes! He was strangely uplifted.

He felt almost joyous in his relief. Could he tell her now as she lay

in her bed? Impossible! He would tell her in the morning. It would be

cruel to disturb her now with such a revelation of her own negligence.

He vibrated with sympathy for her, and he was proud to think that she

appreciated the affectionate, comprehending, subdued intimacy of his

attitude towards her as he leaned gracefully on the foot of the bed,

and that she admired him. He did not know, or rather he absolutely did

not realize, that she was acquainted with aught against his good fame.

He forgot his sins with the insouciance of an animal.
"Don't stay up too late," said Mrs. Maldon, as it were dismissing him.

"A long night will do you no harm for once in a way." She smiled. "I

know you'll see that everything's locked up."
He nodded soothingly, and stood upright.
"You might turn the gas down, rather low."
He tripped to the gas-bracket and put the room in obscurity. The

light of the street lamp irradiated the pale green blinds of the two

windows.
"That do?"
"Nicely, thank you! Good-night, my dear. No, I'm not ill. But you know

I have these little attacks. And then bed's the best place for me."

Her voice seemed to expire.
He crept across the wide carpet and departed with the skill of a

trained nurse, and inaudibly closed the door.
From the landing the whole of the rest of the house seemed to offer

itself to him in the night as an enigmatic and alluring field of

adventure ... Should he drop the notes under the chair on the landing,

where he had found them?... He could not! He could not!... He moved to

the head of the stairs, past the open door of the spare bedroom,

which was now dark. He stopped at the head of the stairs, and then

descended. The kitchen was lighted.
"Are you there?" he asked.
"Yes," replied Rachel.
"May I come?"
"Why, of course!" Her voice trembled.
He went towards the other young creature in the house. The old one lay

above, in a different world remote and foreign. He and Rachel had the

ground floor and all its nocturnal enchantment to themselves.

III
Mechanically, as he went into the kitchen, he drew his cigarette-case

from his pocket. It was the proper gesture of a man in any minor

crisis. He was not a frequenter of kitchens, and this visit, even more

than the brief first one, seemed to him to be adventurous.
Mrs. Maldon's kitchen—or rather Rachel's—was small, warm (though the

fire was nearly out), and agreeable to the eye. On the left wall was a

deal dresser full of crockery, and on the right, under the low window,

a narrow deal table. In front, opposite the door, gleamed the range,

and on either side of the range were cupboards with oak-grained

doors. There was a bright steel fender before the range, and then

a hearth-rug on which stood an oak rocking-chair. The floor was a

friendly chequer of red and black tiles. On the high mantelpiece were

canisters and an alarm-clock and utensils; sundry other utensils hung

on the walls, among the coloured images of sweet girls and Norse-like

men offered by grocers and butchers under the guise of almanacs; and

cupboard doors ajar dimly disclosed other utensils still, so that the

kitchen had the effect of a novel, comfortable kind of workshop; which

effect was helped by the clothes-drier that hung on pulley-ropes from

the ceiling, next to the gas-pendant and to a stalactite of onions.
The uncurtained window, instead of showing black, gave on another

interior, whitewashed, and well illuminated by the kitchen gas. This

other interior had, under a previous tenant of the property, been

a lean-to greenhouse, but Mrs. Maldon esteeming a scullery before a

greenhouse, it had been modified into a scullery. There it was that

Julian Maldon had preferred to make his toilet. One had to pass

through the scullery in order to get from the kitchen into the yard.

And the light of day had to pass through the imperfectly transparent

glass roof of the scullery in order to reach the window of the unused

room behind the parlour; and herein lay the reason why that room was

unused, it being seldom much brighter than a crypt.
At the table stood Rachel, in her immense pinafore-apron, busy with

knives and forks and spoons, and an enamel basin from which steam rose

gently. Louis looked upon Rachel, and for the first time in his life

liked an apron! It struck him as an exceedingly piquant addition to

the young woman's garments. It suited her; it set off the tints of her

notable hair; and it suited the kitchen. Without delaying her work,

Rachel made the protector of the house very welcome. Obviously she

was in a high state of agitation. For an instant Louis feared that the

agitation was due to anxiety on account of Mrs. Maldon.
"Nothing serious up with the old lady, is there?" he asked, pinching

the cigarette to regularize the tobacco in it.
"Oh, no!"
The exclamation in its absolute sincerity dissipated every trace of

his apprehension. He felt gay, calmly happy, and yet excited too. He

was sure, then, that Rachel's agitation was a pleasurable agitation.

It was caused solely by his entrance into the kitchen, by the

compliment he was paying to her kitchen! Her eyes glittered; her face

shone; her little movements were electric; she was intensely conscious

of herself—all because he had come into her kitchen! She could not

conceal—perhaps she did not wish to conceal—the joy that his near

presence inspired. Louis had had few adventures, very few, and this

experience was exquisite and wondrous to him. It roused, not the

fatuous coxcomb, nor the Lothario, but that in him which was honest

and high-spirited. A touch of the male's vanity, not surprising, was

to be excused.
"Mrs. Maldon," said Rachel, "had an idea that it was me who

suggested your staying all night instead of your cousin." She raised

her chin, and peered at nothing through the window as she rubbed away

at a spoon.
"But when?" Louis demanded, moving towards the fire. It appeared to

him that the conversation had taken a most interesting turn.
"When?... When you brought the tray in here for me, I suppose."
"And I suppose you explained to her that I had the idea all out of my

own little head?"
"I told her that I should never have dreamed of asking such a thing!"

The susceptible and proud young creature indicated that the suggestion

was one of Mrs. Maldon's rare social errors, and that Mrs. Maldon had

had a narrow escape of being snubbed for it by the woman of the world

now washing silver. "I'm no more afraid of burglars than you are,"

Rachel added. "I should just like to catch a burglar here—that I

should!"
Louis indulgently doubted the reality of this courage. He had been

too hastily concluding that what Rachel resented was an insinuation of

undue interest in himself, whereas she now made it seem that she was

objecting merely to any reflection upon her valour: which was much

less exciting to him. Still, he thought that both causes might have

contributed to her delightful indignation.
"Why was she so keen about having one of us to sleep here to-night?"

Louis inquired.
"Well, I don't know that she was," answered Rachel. "If you hadn't

said anything—"
"Oh, but do you know what she said to me upstairs?"
"No."
"She didn't want me even to go back to my digs for my things.

Evidently she doesn't care for the house to be left even for half an

hour."
"Well, of course old people are apt to get nervous, you

know—especially when they're not well."
"Funny, isn't it?"
There was perfect unanimity between them as to the irrational

singularity and sad weakness of aged persons.
Louis remarked—
"She said you would make everything right for me upstairs."
"I have done—I hope," said Rachel.
"Thanks awfully!"
One part of the table was covered with newspaper. Suddenly Rachel

tore a strip off the newspaper, folded the strip into a spill, and,

lighting it at the gas, tendered it to Louis' unlit cigarette.
The climax of the movement was so quick and unexpected as almost to

astound Louis. For he had been standing behind her, and she had not

turned her head before making the spill. Perhaps there was a faint

reflection of himself in the window. Or perhaps she had eyes in her

hair. Beyond doubt she was a strange, rare, angelic girl. The gesture

with which she modestly offered the spill was angelic; it was divine;

it was one of those phenomena which persist in a man's memory for

decades. At the very instant of its happening he knew that he should

never forget it.
The man of fashion blushed as he inhaled the first smoke created by

her fire.
Rachel dropped the heavenly emblem, all burning, into the ash-bin of

the range, and resumed her work.
Louis coughed. "Any law against sitting down?" he asked.
"You're very welcome," she replied primly.
"I didn't know I might smoke," he said.
She made no answer at first, but just as Louis had ceased to expect an

answer, she said—
"I should think if you can smoke in the sitting-room you can smoke in

the kitchen—shouldn't you?"
"I should," said he.
There was silence, but silence not disagreeable. Louis, lolling in

the chair, and slightly rocking it, watched Rachel at her task. She

completely immersed spoons and forks in the warm water, and then

rubbed them with a brush like a large nail-brush, giving particular

attention to the inside edges of the prongs of the forks; and then she

laid them all wet on a thick cloth to the right of the basin. But of

the knives she immersed only the blades, and took the most meticulous

care that no drop of water should reach the handles.
"I never knew knives and forks and things were washed like that,"

observed Louis.
"They generally aren't," said Rachel. "But they ought to be. I leave

all the other washing-up for the charwoman in the morning, but I

wouldn't trust these to her." (The charwoman had been washing up

cutlery since before Rachel was born.) "They're all alike," said

Rachel.
Louis acquiesced sagely in this broad generalization as to charwomen.
"Why don't you wash the handles of the knives?" he queried.
"It makes them come loose."
"Really?"
"Do you mean to say you didn't know that water, especially warm water

with soda in it, loosens the handles?" She showed astonishment, but

her gaze never left the table in front of her.
"Not me!"
"Well, I should have thought that everybody knew that. Some people use

a jug, and fill it up with water just high enough to cover the blades,

and stick the knives in to soak. But I don't hold with that because

of the steam, you see. Steam's nearly as bad as water for the handles.

And then some people drop the knives wholesale into a basin just for a

second, to wash the handles. But I don't hold with that, either. What

I say is that you can get the handles clean with the cloth you wipe

them dry with. That's what I say."
"And so there's soda in the water?"
"A little."
"Well, I never knew that either! It's quite a business, it seems to

me."
Without doubt Louis' notions upon domestic work were being modified

with extreme rapidity. In the suburb from which he sprang domestic

work—and in particular washing up—had been regarded as base, foul,

humiliating, unmentionable—as toil that any slut might perform

anyhow. It would have been inconceivable to him that he should admire

a girl in the very act of washing up. Young ladies, even in exclusive

suburban families, were sometimes forced by circumstances to wash

up—of that he was aware—but they washed up in secret and in shame,

and it was proper for all parties to pretend that they never had

washed up. And here was Rachel converting the horrid process into

a dignified and impressive ritual. She made it as fine as fine

needlework—so exact, so dainty, so proud were the motions of her

fingers and her forearms. Obviously washing up was an art, and the

delicate operation could not be scamped nor hurried ...
The triple pile of articles on the cloth grew slowly, but it grew; and

then Rachel, having taken a fresh white cloth from a hook, began to

wipe, and her wiping was an art. She seemed to recognize each fork as

a separate individuality, and to attend to it as to a little animal.

Whatever her view of charwomen, never would she have said of forks

that they were all alike.
Louis felt in his hip pocket for his reserve cigarette-case.
And Rachel immediately said, with her back to him—
"Have you really got a revolver, or were you teasing—just now in the

parlour?"
It was then that he perceived a small unframed mirror, hung at the

height of her face on the broad, central, perpendicular bar of the

old-fashioned window-frame. Through this mirror the chit—so he named

her in his mind at the instant—had been surveying him!
"Yes," he said, producing the second cigarette-case, "I was only

teasing." He lit a fresh cigarette from the end of the previous one.
"Well," she said, "you did frighten Mrs. Maldon. I was so sorry for

her."
"And what about you? Weren't you frightened?"
"Oh no! I wasn't frightened. I guessed, somehow, you were only

teasing."
"Well, I just wasn't teasing, then!" said Louis, triumphantly yet with

benevolence. And he drew a revolver from his pocket.
She turned her head now, and glanced neutrally at the incontestable

revolver for a second. But she made no remark whatever, unless the

pouting of her tightly shut lips and a mysterious smile amounted to a

remark.
Louis adopted an indifferent tone—
"Strange that the old lady should be so nervous just to-night—isn't

it?—seeing these burglars have been knocking about for over a

fortnight. Is this the first time she's got excited about it?"
"Yes, I think it is," said Rachel faintly, as it were submissively,

with no sign of irritation against him.
With their air of worldliness and mature wisdom they twittered on like

a couple of sparrows—inconsequently, capriciously; and nothing that

they said had the slightest originality, weight, or importance. But

they both thought that their conversation was full of significance;

which it was, though they could not explain it to themselves. What

they happened to say did not matter in the least. If they had recited

the Koran to each other the inexplicable significance of their words

would have been the same.
Rachel faced him again, leaning her hands behind her on the table, and

said with the most enchanting, persuasive friendliness—
"I wasn't frightened—truly! I don't know why I looked as though I

was."
"You mean about the revolver—in the sitting-room?" He jumped nimbly

back after her to the revolver question.
"Yes. Because I'm quite used to revolvers, you know. My brother had

one. Only his was a Colt—one of those long things."
"Your brother, eh?"
"Yes. Did you know him?"
"I can't say I did," Louis replied, with some constraint.
Rachel said with generous enthusiasm—
"He's a wonderful shot, my brother is!"
Louis was curiously touched by the warmth of her reference to her

brother. In the daily long monotonous column of advertisements headed

succinctly "Money" in the Staffordshire Signal, there once

used to appear the following invitation: "WE NEVER REFUSE a loan to

a responsible applicant. No fussy inquiries. Distance no objection.

Reasonable terms. Strictest privacy. £3 to £10,000. Apply personally

or by letter. Lovelace Curzon, 7 Colclough Street, Knype." Upon a day

Louis had chosen that advertisement from among its rivals, and had

written to Lovelace Curzon. But on the very next day he had come

into his thousand pounds, and so had lost the advantage of business

relations with Lovelace Curzon. Lovelace Curzon, as he had learnt

later, was Reuben Fleckring, Rachel's father. Or, more accurately,

Lovelace Curzon was Reuben Fleckring, junior, Rachel's brother, a

young man in a million. Reuben, senior, had been for many years an

entirely mediocre and ambitionless clerk in a large works where

Julian Maldon had learnt potting, when Reuben, junior (whom he blindly

adored), had dragged him out of clerkship, and set him up as

the nominal registered head of a money-lending firm. An amazing

occurrence! At that time Reuben, junior, was a minor, scarcely

eighteen. Yet his turn for finance had been such that he had

already amassed reserves, and—without a drop of Jewish blood in his

veins—possessed confidence enough to compete in their own field with

the acutest Hebrews of the district. Reuben, senior, was the youth's

tool.
In a few years Lovelace Curzon had made a mighty and terrible

reputation in the world where expenditures exceed incomes. And

then the subterranean news of the day—not reported in the

Signal—was that something serious had happened to Lovelace

Curzon. And the two Fleckrings went to America, the father, as usual,

hypnotized by the son. And they left no wrack behind save Rachel.
It was at this period—only a few months previous to the opening of

the present narrative—that the district had first heard aught of the

womenfolk of the Fleckrings. An aunt—Reuben, senior's, sister, it

appeared—had died several years earlier, since when Rachel had alone

kept house for her brother and her father. According to rumour

the three had lived in the simplicity of relative poverty, utterly

unvisited except by clients. No good smell of money had ever escaped

from the small front room which was employed as an office into the

domestic portion of the house. It was alleged that Rachel had existed

in perfect ignorance of all details of the business. It was also

alleged that when the sudden crisis arrived, her brother had told her

that she would not be taken to America, and that, briefly, she must

shift for herself in the world. It was alleged further that he had

given her forty-five pounds. (Why forty-five pounds and not fifty,

none knew.) The whole affair had begun and finished—and the house was

sold up—in four days. Public opinion in the street and in Knype blew

violently against the two Reubens, but as they were on the Atlantic

it did not affect them. Rachel, with scarcely an acquaintance in the

world in which she was to shift for herself, found that she had a

streetful of friends! It transpired that everybody had always divined

that she was a girl of admirable efficient qualities. She behaved as

though her brother and father had behaved in quite a usual and proper

manner. Assistance in the enterprise of shifting for herself she

welcomed, but not sympathy. The devotion of the Fleckring women began

to form a legend. People said that Rachel's aunt had been another such

creature as Rachel.
Hence the effect on Louis, who, through his aunt and his cousin,

was acquainted with the main facts and surmises, of Rachel's glowing

reference to the vanished Reuben.
"Where did your brother practise?" he asked.
"In the cellar."
"Of course it's easier with a long barrel."
"Is it?" she said incredulously. "You should see my brother's

score-card the first time he shot at that new miniature rifle-range in

Hanbridge!"
"Why? Is it anything special?"
"Well, you should see it. Five bulls, all cutting into each other."
"I should have liked to see that."
"I've got it upstairs in my trunk," said she proudly. "I dare say I'll

show you it some time."
"I wish you would," he urged.
Such loyalty moved him deeply. Louis had had no sisters, and his

youthful suburban experience of other people's sisters had not

fostered any belief that loyalty was an outstanding quality of

sisters. Like very numerous young men of the day, he had passed an

unfavourable judgment upon young women. He had found them greedy for

diversion, amazingly ruthless in their determination to exact the

utmost possible expensiveness of pleasure in return for their casual

society, hard, cruelly clever in conversation, efficient in certain

directions, but hating any sustained effort, and either socially or

artistically or politically snobbish. Snobs all! Money-worshippers

all!... Well, nearly all! It mattered not whether you were one of the

dandies or one of the hatless or Fletcherite corps that lolled on foot

or on bicycles, or shot on motor-cycles, through the prim streets of

the suburb—the young women would not remain in dalliance with you

for the mere sake of your beautiful eyes. Because they were girls

they would take all that you had and more, and give you nothing but

insolence or condescension in exchange. Such was Louis' judgment, and

scores of times he had confirmed it in private saloon-lounge talk

with his compeers. It had not, however, rendered the society of these

unconscionable and cold female creatures distasteful to him. Not a

bit! He had even sought it and been ready to pay for that society in

the correct manner—even to imperturbably beggaring himself of his

final sixpence in order to do the honours of the latest cinema. Only,

he had a sense of human superiority. It certainly did not occur to

him that in the victimized young men there might exist faults which

complemented those of the parasitic young women.
And now he contrasted these young women with Rachel! And he fell

into a dreamy mood of delight in her.... Her gesture in lighting his

cigarette! Marvellous! Tear-compelling!... Flippancy dropped away from

him.... She liked him. With the most alluring innocence, she did not

conceal that she liked him. He remembered that the last time he called

at his aunt's he had remarked something strange, something disturbing,

in Rachel's candid demeanour towards himself. He had made an

impression on her! He had given her the lightning-stroke! No shadow of

a doubt as to his own worthiness crossed his mind.
What did cross his mind was that she was not quite of his own class.

In the suburb, where "sets" are divided one from another by unscalable

barriers, she could not have aspired to him. But in the kitchen, now

become the most beautiful and agreeable and romantic interior that he

had ever seen—in the kitchen he could somehow perceive with absolute

clearness that the snobbery of caste was silly, negligible, laughable,

contemptible. Yes, he could perceive all that! Life in the kitchen

seemed ideal—life with that loyalty and that candour and that charm

and that lovely seriousness! Moreover, he could teach her. She had

already blossomed—in a fortnight. She was blossoming. She would

blossom further.
Odd that, when he had threatened to pull out a revolver, she, so

accustomed to revolvers, should have taken a girlish alarm! That queer

detail of her behaviour was extraordinarily seductive. But far beyond

everything else it was the grand loyalty of her nature that drew him.

He wanted to sink into it as into a bed of down. He really needed

it. Enveloped in that loving loyalty of a creature who gave all and

demanded nothing, he felt that he could truly be his best self, that

he could work marvels. His eyes were moist with righteous ardour.
The cutlery reposed in a green-lined basket. She had doffed the apron

and hung it behind the scullery door. With all the delicious curves of

her figure newly revealed, she was reaching the alarm-clock down from

the mantelpiece, and then she was winding it up. The ratchet of the

wheel clacked, and the hurried ticking was loud. In the grate of the

range burned one spot of gloomy red.
"Your bedtime, I suppose?" he murmured, rising elegantly.
She smiled. She said—
"Shall you lock up, or shall I?"
"Oh! I think I know all the tricks," he replied, and thought, "She's a

pretty direct sort of girl, anyway!"

IV
About an hour later he went up to his room. It was a fact that

everything had been made right for him. The gas burned low. He raised

it, and it shone directly upon the washstand, which glittered with

the ivory glaze of large earthenware, and the whiteness of towels that

displayed all the creases of their folding. There was a new cake of

soap in the ample soap-dish, and a new tooth-brush in a sheath of

transparent paper lay on the marble. "Rather complete this!" he

reflected. The nail-brush—an article in which he specialized—was

worn, but it was worn evenly and had cost good money. The water-bottle

dazzled him; its polished clarity was truly crystalline. He could

not remember ever having seen a toilet array so shining with strict

cleanness. Indeed, it was probable that he had never set eyes on an

absolutely clean water-bottle before; the qualities associated with

water-bottles in his memory were semi-opacity and spottiness.
The dressing-table matched the washstand. A carriage clock in leather

had been placed on the mantelpiece. In front of the mantelpiece was an

old embroidered fire-screen. Peeping between the screen and the grate,

he saw that a fire had been scientifically laid, ready for lighting;

but some bits of paper and oddments on the top of the coal showed that

it was not freshly laid. The grate had a hob at one side, and on

this was a small, bright tin kettle. The bed was clearly a good bed,

resilient, softly garnished. On it was stretched a long, striped

garment of flannel, with old-fashioned pearl buttons at neck and

sleeves. An honest garment, quite surely unshrinkable! No doubt in the

sixties, long before the mind of man had leaped to the fine perverse

conception of the decorated pyjama, this garment had enjoyed the

fullest correctness. Now, after perhaps forty years in the cupboards

of Mrs. Maldon, it seemed to recall the more excellent attributes of

an already forgotten past, and to rebuke what was degenerate in the

present.
Louis, ranging over his experiences in the disorderly and mean

pretentiousness of the suburban home, and in the discomfort of

various lodgings, appreciated the grave, comfortable benignity of that

bedroom. Its appeal to his senses was so strong that it became for

him almost luxurious. The bedroom at his latest lodgings was full

of boot-trees and trouser-stretchers and coat-holders, but it was a

paltry thing and a grimy. He saw the daily and hourly advantages of

marriage with a loving, simple woman whose house was her pride. He had

a longing for solidities, certitudes, and righteousness.
Musing delectably, he drew aside the crimson curtain from the window

and beheld the same prospect that Rachel had beheld on her walk

towards Friendly Street—the obscurity of the park, the chain of lamps

down the slope of Moorthorne Road, and the distant fires of industry

still farther beyond, towards Toft End. He had hated the foul, sordid,

ragged prospects and vistas of the Five Towns when he came new to them

from London, and he had continued to hate them. They desolated him.

But to-night he thought of them sympathetically. It was as if he was

divining in them for the first time a recondite charm. He remembered

what an old citizen named Dain had said one evening at the

Conservative Club: "People may say what they choose about Bursley.

I've just returned from London and I tell thee I was glad to get back.

I like Bursley." A grotesque saying, he had thought, then.

Yet now he positively felt himself capable of sharing the sentiment.

Rachel in the kitchen, and the kitchen in town, and the town amid

those scarred and smoking hillocks!... Invisible phenomena! Mysterious

harmonies! The influence of the night solaced and uplifted him and

bestowed on him new faculties of perception.
At length, deciding, after characteristic procrastination, that

he must really go to bed, he wound up his watch and put it on the

dressing-table. His pockets had to be emptied and his clothes hung or

folded. His fingers touched the notes in the left-hand outside pocket

of his coat. Not for one instant had the problem of the bank-notes

been absent from his mind. Throughout the conversation with Rachel,

throughout the interval between her retirement and his own, throughout

his meditations in the bedroom, he had not once escaped from the

obsession of the bank-notes and their problem. He knew now how the

problem must be solved. There was, after all, only one solution, and

it was extremely simple. He must put the notes back where he had found

them, underneath the chair on the landing. If advisable, he might

rediscover them in the morning and surrender them immediately. But

they must not remain in his room during the night. He must not examine

them—he must not look at them.
He approached the door quickly, lest he might never reach the door.

But he was somehow forced to halt at the wardrobe, to see if it

had coat-holders. It had one coat-holder.... His hand was on the

door-knob. He turned it with every species of precaution—and it

complained loudly in the still night. The door opened with a terrible

explosive noise of protest. He gazed into the darkness of the landing,

and presently, by the light from the bedroom, could distinguish the

vague boundaries of it. The chair, invisible, was on the left. He

opened the door wider to the nocturnal riddle of the house. His hand

clasped the notes in his pocket. No sound! He listened for the ticking

of the lobby clock and could not catch it. He listened more intently.

It was impossible that he should not hear the ticking of the lobby

clock. Was he dreaming? Was he under some delusion? Then it occurred

to him that the lobby clock must have run down or otherwise stopped.

Clocks did stop.... And then his heart bounded and his flesh crept. He

had heard footsteps somewhere below. Or were the footsteps merely in

his imagination?
Alone in the parlour, after Rachel had gone to bed, he had spent some

time in gazing at the Signal; for there had been absolutely

nothing else to do, and he could not have thought of sleep at such an

early hour. It is true that, with his intense preoccupations, he had

for the most part gazed uncomprehendingly at the Signal. The

tale of the latest burglaries, however, had by virtue of its intrinsic

interest reached his brain through his eyes, and had impressed him,

despite preoccupations. And now, as he stood in the gloom at the door

of his bedroom and waited feverishly for the sound of more footsteps,

it was inevitable that visions of burglars should disturb him.
The probability of burglars visiting any particular house in the

town was infinitely slight—his common sense told him that. But

supposing—just supposing that they actually had chosen his aunt's

abode for their prey!... Conceivably they had learnt that Mrs. Maldon

was to have a large sum of money under her roof. Conceivably a complex

plan had been carefully laid. Conceivably one of the great burglaries

of criminal history might be in progress. It was not impossible. No

wonder that, with bank-notes loose all over the place, his shockingly

negligent auntie should have special qualms concerning burglars on

that night of all nights! Fortunate indeed that he carried a revolver,

that the revolver was loaded, and that he had some skill to use it! A

dramatic surprise—his gun and the man behind it—for burglars who had

no doubt counted on having to deal with a mere couple of women! He

had but to remove his shoes and creep down the stairs. He felt at the

revolver in his pocket. Often had he pictured himself in the act of

calmly triumphing over burglars or other villains.
Then, with no further hesitation, he silently closed the door—on the

inside!... How could there be burglars in the house? The suspicion was

folly. What he had heard could be naught but the nocturnal cracking

and yielding of an old building at night. Was it not notorious that

the night was full of noises? And even if burglars had entered!...

Better, safer, to ignore them! They could not make off with a great

deal, for the main item of prey happened to be in his own pocket.

Let them search for the treasure! If they had the effrontery to come

searching in his bedroom, he would give them a reception! Let them

try! He looked at the revolver, holding it beneath the gas. Could he

aim it at a human being?...
Or—another explanation—possibly Rachel, having forgotten something

or having need of something, had gone downstairs for it. He had not

thought of that. But what more natural? Sudden toothache—a desire for

laudanum—a visit to a store cupboard: such was the classic order of

events.
He listened, secure within the four walls of his bedroom. He smiled.

He could have fancied that he heard an electric bell ring ever so

faintly at a distance—in the next house, in the next world.
He laughed to himself.
Then at length he moved again towards the door; and he paused in front

of it. There were no burglars! The notion of burglars was idiotic! He

must put the notes back under the chair. His whole salvation depended

upon his putting the notes back under the chair on the landing!...

An affair of two seconds!... With due caution he opened the door. And

simultaneously, at the very selfsame instant, he most distinctly heard

the click of the latch of his aunt's bedroom door, next his own! Now,

in a horrible quandary, trembling and perspiring, he felt completely

nonplussed. He pushed his own door to, but without quite closing it,

for fear of a noise; and edged away from it towards the fireplace.
Had his aunt wakened up, and felt a misgiving about the notes, and

found that they were not where they ought to be?
No further sound came though the crack of his door. In the dwelling

absolute silence seemed to be established. He stood thus for an

indefinite period in front of the fireplace, the brain's action

apparently suspended, until his agitation was somewhat composed. And

then, because he had no clear plan in his head, he put his hand into

the pocket containing the notes and drew them out. And immediately he

was aware of a pleasant feeling of relief, as one who, after battling

against a delicious and shameful habit, yields and is glad. The beauty

of the notes was eternal; no use could stale it. Their intoxicating

effect on him was just as powerful now as before supper. And now, as

then, the mere sight of them filled him with a passionate conviction

that without them he would be ruined. His tricks to destroy the

suspicions of Horrocleave could not possibly be successful. Within

twenty-four hours he might be in prison if he could not forthwith

command a certain sum of money. And even possessing the money, he

would still have an extremely difficult part to play. It would be

necessary for him to arrive early at the works, to change notes for

gold in the safe, to erase many of his pencilled false additions,

to devise a postponement of his crucial scene with Horrocleave, and

lastly to invent a plausible explanation of the piling up of a cash

reserve.
If he had not been optimistic and an incurable procrastinator and a

believer in luck at the last moment, he would have seen that nothing

but a miracle could save him if Horrocleave were indeed suspicious.

Happily for his peace of mind, he was incapable of looking a fact

in the face. Against all reason he insisted to himself that with the

notes he might reach salvation. He did not trouble even to estimate

the chances of the notes being traced by their numbers. Such is the

magic force of a weak character.
But he powerfully desired not to steal the notes, or any of them.

The image of Rachel rose between him and his temptation. Her honesty,

candour, loyalty, had revealed to him the beauty of the ways of

righteousness. He had been born again in her glance. He swore he would

do nothing unworthy of the ideal she had unconsciously set up in him.

He admitted that it was supremely essential for him to restore the

notes to the spot whence he had removed them.... And yet—if he did

so, and was lost? What then? For one second he saw himself in the

dock at the police-court in the town hall. Awful hallucination! If it

became reality, what use, then, his obedience to the new ideal? Better

to accomplish this one act of treason to the ideal in order to be able

for ever afterwards to obey it and to look Rachel in the eyes! Was

it not so? He wanted advice, he wanted to be confirmed in his own

opportunism, as a starving beggar may want food.
And in the midst of all this torture of his vacillations, he was

staggered and overwhelmed by the sudden noise of Mrs. Maldon's door

brusquely opening, and of an instant loud, firm knock on his own door.

The silence of the night was shattered as by an earthquake.
Almost mechanically he crushed the notes in his left hand—crushed

them into a ball; and the knuckles of that hand turned white with the

muscular tension.
"Are you up?" a voice demanded. It was Rachel's voice.
"Ye-es," he answered, and held his left hand over the screen in front

of the fireplace.
"May I come in?"
And with the word she came in. She was summarily dressed, and very

pale, and her hair, more notable than ever, was down. As she entered

he opened his hand and let the ball of notes drop into the littered

grate.

V
"Anything the matter?" he asked, moving away from the region of the

hearth-rug.
She glanced at him with a kind of mild indulgence, as if to say:

"Surely you don't suppose I should be wandering about in the night

like this if nothing was the matter!"
She replied, speaking quickly and eagerly—"I'm so glad you aren't in

bed. I want you to go and fetch the doctor—at once."
"Auntie ill?"
She gave him another glance like the first, as if to say: "I'm

not ill, and you aren't. And Mrs. Maldon is the only other

person in the house—"
"I'll go instantly," he added in haste. "Which doctor?"
"Yardley in Park Road. It's near the corner of Axe Street. You'll know

it by the yellow gate—even if his lamp isn't lighted."
"I thought old Hawley up at Hillport was auntie's doctor."
"I believe he is, but you couldn't get up to Hillport in less than

half an hour, could you?"
"Not so serious as all that, is it?"
"Well, you never know. Best to be on the safe side. It's not quite

like one of her usual attacks. She's been upset. She actually went

downstairs."
"I thought I heard somebody. Did you hear her, then?"
"No, she rang for me afterwards. There's a little electric bell over

my bed, from her room."
"And I heard that too," said Louis.
"Will you ask Dr. Yardley to come at once?"
"I'm off," said he. "What a good thing I wasn't in bed!"
"What a good thing you're here at all!" Rachel murmured, suddenly

smiling.
He was waiting anxiously for her to leave the room again. But instead

of leaving it she came to the fireplace and looked behind the screen.

He trembled.
"Oh! That kettle is there! I thought it must be!" And picked it

up.
Then, with the kettle in one hand, she went to a large cupboard let

into the wall opposite the door, and opened it.
"You know Park Road, I suppose?" she turned to him.
"Yes, yes, I'm off!"
He was obliged to go, surrendering the room to her. As he descended

the stairs he heard her come out of the room. She was following him

downstairs. "Don't bang the door," she whispered. "I'll come and shut

it after you."
The next moment he had undone the door and was down the front steps

and in the solitude of Bycars Lane. He ran up the street, full of the

one desire to accomplish his errand and be back again in the spare

bedroom alone. The notes were utterly safe where they lay, and

yet—astounding events might happen. Was it not a unique coincidence

that on this very night and no other his aunt should fall ill, and

that as a result Rachel should take him unawares at the worst moment

of his dilemma? And further, could it be the actual fact, as he had

been wildly guessing only a few minutes earlier, that his aunt had at

last missed the notes? Could it be that it was this discovery which

had upset her and brought on an attack?... An attack of what?
He swerved at the double into Park Road, which was a silent desert

watched over by forlorn gaslamps. He saw the yellow gate. The yellow

gate clanked after him. He searched in the deep shadow of the porch

for the button of the night bell, and had to strike a match in order

to find it. He rang; waited and waited, rang again; waited; rang a

third time, keeping his finger hard on the button. Then arose and

expired a flickering light in the hall of the house.
"That'll do! That'll do! You needn't wear the bell out." He could hear

the irritated accents through the glazed front door.
A dim figure in a dressing-gown opened.
"Are you Dr. Yardley?" Louis gasped between rapid breaths.
"What is it?" The question was savage.
With his extraordinary instinctive amiability Louis smiled naturally

and persuasively.
"You're wanted at Mrs. Maldon's, Bycars. Awfully sorry to disturb

you."
"Oh!" said the dressing-gown in a changed, interested tone. "Mrs.

Maldon's! Right. I'll follow you."
"You'll come at once?" Louis urged.
"I shall come at once."
The door was curtly closed.
"So that's how you call a doctor in the middle of the night!" thought

Louis, and ran off. He had scarcely deciphered the man's face.
The return, being chiefly downhill, was less exhausting. As he

approached his aunt's house he saw that there was a light on the

ground floor as well as in the front bedroom. The door opened as he

swung the gate. The lobby gas had been lighted. Rachel was waiting for

him. Her hair was tied up now. The girl looked wise, absurdly so.

It was as though she was engaged in the act of being equal to the

terrible occasion.
"He's coming," said Louis.
"You've been frightfully quick!" said she, as if triumphantly. She

appeared to glory in the crisis.
He passed within as she held the door. He was frantic to rush upstairs

to the fireplace in his room; but he had to seem deliberate.
"And what next?" he inquired.
"Well, nothing. It'll be best for you to sit in your bedroom for

a bit. That's the only place where there's a fire—and it's rather

chilly at this time of night."
"A fire?" he repeated, incredulous and yet awe-struck.
"I knew you wouldn't mind," said she. "It just happened there wasn't

two drops of methylated spirits left in the house, and as there was

a fire laid in your room, I put a match to it. I must have hot water

ready, you see. And Mrs. Maldon only has one of those old-fashioned

gas-stoves in her bedroom—"
"I see," he agreed.
They mounted the steps together. The grate in his room was a mass of

pleasant flames, in the midst of which gleamed the bright kettle.
"How is she now?" He asked in a trance. And he felt as though it was

another man in his own body who was asking.
"Oh! It's not very serious, I hope," said Rachel, kneeling to coax the

fire with a short, wiry poker. "Only you never know. I'm just going

in again.... She seems to lose all her vitality—that's what's apt to

frighten you."
The girl looked wise—absurdly, deliciously wise. The spectacle of her

engaged in the high act of being equal to the occasion was exquisite.

But Louis had no eye for it.

CHAPTER V
NEWS OF THE NIGHT

I
The next morning, Mrs. Tarns, the charwoman whom Rachel had expressly

included in the dogma that all charwomen are alike, was cleaning the

entranceway to Mrs. Maldon's house. She had washed and stoned the

steep, uneven flight of steps leading up to the front door, and the

flat space between them and the gate; and now, before finishing the

step down to the footpath, she was wiping the grimy ledges of the

green iron gate itself.
Mrs. Tarns was a woman of nearly sixty, stout and—in

appearance—untidy and dirty. The wet wind played with grey wisps of

her hair, and with her coarse brown apron, beneath which her skirt was

pinned up. Human eye so seldom saw her without a coarse brown apron

that, apronless, she would have almost seemed (like Eve) to be

unattired. It and a pail were the insignia of her vocation.
She was accomplished and conscientious; she could be trusted; despite

appearances, her habits were cleanly. She was also a woman of immense

experience. In addition to being one of the finest exponents of the

art of step-stoning and general housework that the Five Towns could

show, she had numerous other talents. She was thoroughly accustomed

to the supreme spectacles of birth and death, and could assist

thereat with dignity and skill. She could turn away the wrath of

rent-collectors, rate-collectors, school-inspectors, and magistrates.

She was an adept in enticing an inebriated husband to leave a

public-house. She could feed four children for a day on sevenpence,

and rise calmly to her feet after having been knocked down by one

stroke of a fist. She could go without food, sleep, and love, and yet

thrive. She could give when she had nothing, and keep her heart sweet

amid every contagion. Lastly, she could coax extra sixpences out of

a pawnbroker. She had never had a holiday, and almost never failed in

her duty. Her one social fault was a tendency to talk at great length

about babies, corpses, and the qualities of rival soaps. All her

children were married. Her husband had gone in a box to a justice

whose anger Mrs. Tam's simple tongue might not soothe. She lived

alone. Six half-days a week she worked about the house of Mrs.

Maldon from eight to one o'clock, for a shilling per half-day and her

breakfast. But if she chose to stay for it she could have dinner—and

a good one—on condition that she washed up afterwards. She often

stayed. After over forty years of incessant and manifold expert labour

she was happy and content in this rich reward.
A long automobile came slipping with noiseless stealth down the hill,

and halted opposite the gate, in silence, for the engine had been

stopped higher up. Mrs. Tams, intimidated by the august phenomenon,

ceased to rub, and in alarm watched the great Thomas Batchgrew

struggle unsuccessfully with the handle of the door that imprisoned

him. Mrs. Tams was a born serf, and her nature was such that she

wanted to apologize to Thomas Batchgrew for the naughtiness of the

door. For her there was something monstrous in a personage like Thomas

Batchgrew being balked in a desire, even for a moment, by a perverse

door-catch. Not that she really respected Thomas Batchgrew! She

did not, but he was a member of the sacred governing class. The

chauffeur—not John's Ernest, but a professional—flashed round the

front of the car and opened the door with obsequious haste. For Thomas

Batchgrew had to be appeased. Already a delay of twenty minutes—due

to a defective tire and to the inexcusable absence of the spanner with

which the spare wheel was manipulated—had aroused his just anger.
Mrs. Tarns pulled the gate towards herself and, crushed behind it,

curtsied to Thomas Batchgrew. This curtsy, the most servile of all

Western salutations, and now nearly unknown in Five Towns, consisted

in a momentary shortening of the stature by six inches, and in nothing

else. Mrs. Tams had acquired it in her native village of Sneyd, where

an earl held fast to that which was good, and she had never been able

to quite lose it. It did far more than the celerity of the chauffeur

to appease Thomas Batchgrew.
Snorting and self-conscious, and with his white whiskers flying behind

him, he stepped in his two overcoats across the narrow, muddy pavement

and on to Mrs. Tarn's virgin stonework, and with two haughty black

footmarks he instantly ruined it. The tragedy produced no effect on

Mrs. Tams. And indeed nobody in the Five Towns would have been moved

by it. For the social convention as to porticoes enjoined, not that

they should remain clean, but simply that they should show evidence

of having been clean at some moment early in each day. It mattered not

how dirty they were in general, provided that the religious and futile

rite of stoning had been demonstrably performed during the morning.
Mrs. Tams adroitly moved her bucket, aside, though there was plenty

of room for feet even larger than those of Thomas Batchgrew, and then

waited to be spoken to. She was not spoken to. Mr. Batchgrew, after

hesitating and clearing his throat, proceeded up the steps, defiling

them. As he did so Mrs. Tams screwed together all her features and

clenched her hands as if in agony, and stared horribly at the open

front door, which was blowing to. It seemed that she was trying to

arrest the front door by sheer force of muscular contraction. She did

not succeed. Gently the door closed, with a firm click of its latch,

in face of Mr. Batchgrew.
"Nay, nay!" muttered Mrs. Tarns, desolated.
And Mr. Batchgrew, once more justly angered, raised his hand to the

heavy knocker.
"Dunna' knock, mester! Dunna' knock!" Mrs. Tarns implored in a

whisper. "Missis is asleep. Miss Rachel's been up aw night wi' her,

seemingly, and now her's gone off in a doze like, and Miss Rachel's

resting, too, on th' squab i' th' parlor. Doctor was fetched."
Apparently charging Mrs. Tarns with responsibility for the illness,

Mr. Batchgrew demanded severely—
"What was it?"
"One o' them attacks as her has," said Mrs. Tarns with a meekness that

admitted she could offer no defence, "only wuss!"
"Hurry round to th' back door and let me in."
"I doubt back door's bolted on th' inside," said Mrs. Tarns with deep

humility.
"This is ridiculous," said Mr. Batchgrew, truly. "Am I to stand here

all day?" And raised his hand to the knocker.
Mrs. Tarns with swiftness darted up the steps and inserted a large,

fat, wet hand between the raised knocker and its bed. It was

the sublime gesture of a martyr, and her large brown eyes gazed

submissively, yet firmly, at Mr. Batchgrew with the look of a martyr.

She had nothing to gain by the defiance of a great man, but she could

not permit her honoured employer to be wakened. She was accustomed to

emergencies, and to desperate deeds therein, and she did not fail

now in promptly taking the right course, regardless of consequences.

Somewhat younger than Mr. Batchgrew in years, she was older in

experience and in wisdom. She could do a thousand things well; Mr.

Batchgrew could do nothing well. At that very moment she conquered,

and he was beaten. Yet her brown eyes and even the sturdy uplifted arm

cringed to him, and asked in abasement to be forgiven for the impiety

committed. From her other hand a cloth dripped foul water on to the

topmost step.
And then the door yielded. Thomas Batchgrew and Mrs. Tarns both

abandoned the knocker. Rachel, pale as a lily, stern, with dilated

eyes, stood before them. And Mr. Batchgrew realized, as he looked

at her against the dark, hushed background of the stairs, that Mrs.

Maldon was indeed ill. Mrs. Tams respectfully retired down the steps.

A mightier than she, the young, naïve, ignorant girl, to whom she

could have taught everything save possibly the art of washing cutlery,

had relieved her of responsibility.
"You can't see her," said Rachel in a low tone, trembling.
"But—but—" Thomas Batchgrew spluttered, ineffectively. "D'you know

I'm her trustee, miss? Let me come in."
Rachel would not take her hand off the inner knob.
There was the thin, far-off sound of an electric bell, breaking the

silence of the house. It was the bell in Rachel's bedroom, rung from

Mrs. Maldon's bedroom. And at this mysterious signal from the invalid,

this faint proof that the hidden sufferer had consciousness and

volition, Rachel started and Thomas Batchgrew started.
"Her bell!" Rachel exclaimed, and fled upstairs.
In the large bedroom Mrs. Maldon lay apparently at ease.
"Did they waken you?" cried Rachel, distressed.
"Who is there, dear?" Mrs. Maldon asked, in a voice that had almost

recovered from the weakness of the night, Rachel was astounded.
"Mr. Batchgrew."
"I must see him," said the old lady.
"But—"
"I must see him at once," Mrs. Maldon repeated. "At once. Kindly bring

him up." And she added, in a curiously even and resigned tone, "I've

lost all that money!"

II
"Nay," said Mrs. Maldon to Thomas Batchgrew, "I'm not going to die

just yet."
Her voice was cheerful, even a little brisk, and she spoke with a

benign smile in the tranquil accents of absolute conviction. But she

did not move her head; she waited to look at Thomas Batchgrew until

he came within her field of vision at the foot of the bed. This

quiescence had a disconcerting effect, contradicting her voice.
She was lying on her back, in the posture customary to her, the arms

being stretched down by the sides under the bed-quilt. Her features

were drawn slightly askew; the skin was shiny; the eyes stared as

though Mrs. Maldon had been a hysterical subject. It was evident that

she had passed through a tremendous physical crisis. Nevertheless,

Rachel was still astounded at the change for the better in her,

wrought by sleep and the force of her obstinate vitality.
The contrast between the scene which Thomas Batchgrew now saw and

the scene which had met Rachel in the night was so violent as to seem

nearly incredible. Not a sign of the catastrophe remained, except in

Mrs. Maldon's face, and in some invalid gear on the dressing-table,

for Rachel had gradually got the room into order. She had even closed

and locked the wardrobe.
On answering Mrs. Maldon's summons in the night, Rachel had found the

central door of the wardrobe swinging and the sacred big drawer at the

bottom of that division only half shut, and Mrs. Maldon in a peignoir

lying near it on the floor, making queer inhuman noises, not moans,

but a kind of anxious, inarticulate entreaty, and shaking her head

constantly to the left—never to the right. Mrs. Maldon had recognized

Rachel, and had seemed to implore with agonized intensity her

powerful assistance in some nameless and hopeless tragic dilemma. The

sight—especially of the destruction of the old woman's dignity—was

dreadful to such an extent that Rachel did not realize its effect on

herself until several hours afterwards. At the moment she called on

the immense reserves of her self-confidence to meet the situation—and

she met it, assisting her pride with the curious pretence,

characteristic of the Five Towns race, that the emergency was

insufficient to alarm in the slightest degree a person of sagacity and

sang-froid.
She had restored Mrs. Maldon to her bed and to some of her dignity.

But the horrid symptoms were not thereby abated. The inhuman

noises and the distressing, incomprehensible appeal had continued.

Immediately Rachel's back was turned Mrs. Maldon had fallen out of

bed. This happened three times, so that clearly the sufferer was

falling out of bed under the urgency of some half-conscious purpose.

Rachel had soothed her. And once she had managed to say with some

clearness the words, "I've been downstairs." But when Rachel went back

to the room from dispatching Louis for the doctor, she was again on

the floor. Louis' absence from the house had lasted an intolerable

age, but the doctor had followed closely on the messenger, and already

the symptoms had become a little less acute. The doctor had diagnosed

with rapidity. Supervening upon her ordinary cardiac attack after

supper, Mrs. Maldon had had, in the night, an embolus in one artery

of the brain. The way in which the doctor announced the fact showed to

Rachel that nothing could easily have been more serious. And yet

the mere naming of the affliction eased her, although she had no

conception of what an embolus might be. Dr. Yardley had remained until

four o'clock, when Mrs. Maldon, surprisingly convalescent, dropped off

to sleep. He remarked that she might recover.
At eight o'clock he had come back. Mrs. Maldon was awake, but had

apparently no proper recollection of the events of the night, which

even to Rachel had begun to seem unreal, like a waning hallucination.

The doctor gave orders, with optimism, and left, sufficiently

reassured to allow himself to yawn. At a quarter past eight Louis had

departed to his own affairs, on Rachel's direct suggestion. And when

Mrs. Tams had been informed of the case so full of disturbing enigmas,

while Rachel and she drank tea together in the kitchen, the daily

domestic movement of the house was partly resumed, from vanity,

because Rachel could not bear to sit idle nor to admit to herself that

she had been scared to a standstill.
And now Mrs. Maldon, in full possession of her faculties, faced Thomas

Batchgrew for the interview which she had insisted on having. And

Rachel waited with an uncanny apprehension, her ears full of the

mysterious and frightful phrase, "I've lost all that money."

III
Mrs. Maldon, after a few words had passed as to her illness, used

exactly the same phrase again—"I've lost all that money!"
Mr. Batchgrew snorted, and glanced at Rachel for an explanation.
"Yes. It's all gone," proceeded Mrs. Maldon with calm resignation.

"But I'm too old to worry. Please listen to me. We lost my serviette

and ring last evening at supper. Couldn't find it anywhere. And in

the night it suddenly occurred to me where it was. I've remembered

everything now, almost, and I'm quite sure. You know you first told

me to put the money in my wardrobe. Now before you said that, I had

thought of putting it on the top of the cupboard to the right of the

fireplace in the back room downstairs. I thought that would be a good

place for it in case burglars did come. No burglar would ever

think of looking there."
"God bless me!" Mr. Batchgrew muttered, scornfully protesting.
"It couldn't possibly be seen, you see. However, I thought I ought to

respect your wish, and so I decided I'd put part of it on the top of

the cupboard, and part of it underneath a lot of linen at the bottom

of the drawer in my wardrobe. That would satisfy both of us."
"Would it!" exclaimed Mr. Batchgrew, without any restraint upon his

heavy, rolling voice.
"Well, I must have picked up the serviette and ring with the

bank-notes, you see. I fear I'm absent-minded like that sometimes. I

know I went out of the sitting-room with both hands full. I know both

hands were occupied, because I remember when I went into the back room

I didn't turn the gas up, and I pushed a chair up to the cupboard with

my knee, for me to stand on. I'm certain I put some of the notes

on the top of the cupboard. Then I came upstairs. The window on the

landing was rattling, and I put the other part of the money on the

chair while I tried to fasten the window. However, I couldn't fasten

it. So I left it. And then I thought I picked up the money again off

the chair and came in here and hid it at the bottom of the drawer and

locked the wardrobe."
"You thought!" said Thomas Batchgrew, gazing at the aged weakling as

at an insane criminal. "Was this just after I left?"
Mrs. Maldon nodded apologetically.
"When I woke up the first time in the night, it struck me like

a flash: Had I taken the serviette and ring up with the notes? I

am liable to do that sort of thing. I'm an old woman—it's

no use denying it." She looked plaintively at Rachel, and her voice

trembled. "I got up. I was bound to get up, and I turned the gas on,

and there the serviette and ring were at the bottom of the drawer, but

no money! I took everything out of the drawer, piece by piece, and put

it back again. I simply cannot tell you how I felt! I went out to

the landing with a match. There was no money there. And then I went

downstairs in the dark. I never knew it to be so dark, in spite of the

street-lamp. I knocked against the clock. I nearly knocked it over.

I managed to light the gas in the back room. I made sure that I must

have left all the notes on the top of the cupboard instead of

only part of them. But there was nothing there at all. Nothing! Then

I looked all over the sitting-room floor with a candle. When I got

upstairs again I didn't know what I was doing. I knew I was going to

be ill, and I just managed to ring the bell for dear Rachel, and

the next thing I remember was I was in bed here, and Rachel putting

something hot to my feet—the dear child!"
Her eyes glistened with tears. And Rachel too, as she pictured

the enfeebled and despairing incarnation of dignity colliding with

grandfather's clocks in the night and climbing on chairs and groping

over carpets, had difficulty not to cry, and a lump rose in her

throat. She was so moved by compassion that she did not at first feel

the full shock of the awful disappearance of the money.
Mr. Batchgrew, for the second time that morning unequal to a

situation, turned foolishly to the wardrobe, clearing his throat and

snorting.
"It's on one of the sliding trays," said Mrs. Maldon.
"What's on one of the sliding trays?"
"The serviette."
Rachel, who was nearest, opened the wardrobe and immediately

discovered the missing serviette and ring, which had the appearance of

a direct dramatic proof of Mrs. Maldon's story.
Mr. Batchgrew exclaimed, indignant—
"I never heard such a rigmarole in all my born days." And then,

angrily to Rachel, "Go down and look on th' top o' th' cupboard,

thee!"
Rachel hesitated.
"I'm quite resigned," said Mrs. Maldon placidly. "It's a punishment on

me for hardening my heart to Julian last night. It's a punishment for

my pride."
"Now, then!" Mr. Batchgrew glared bullyingly at Rachel, who vanished.
In a few moments she returned.
"There's nothing at all on the top of the cupboard."
"But th' money must be somewhere," said Mr. Batchgrew savagely. "Nine

hundred and sixty-five pun. And I've arranged to lend out that money

again, at once! What am I to say to th' mortgagor? Am I to tell him as

I've lost it?... No! I never!"
Mrs. Maldon murmured—
"Nay, nay! It's no use looking at me. I thought I should never get

over it in the night. But I'm quite resigned now."
Rachel, standing near the door, could observe both Mrs. Maldon and

Thomas Batchgrew, and was regarded by neither of them. And while,

in the convulsive commotion of her feelings, her sympathy for and

admiration of Mrs. Maldon became poignant, she was thrilled by the

most intense scorn and disgust for Thomas Batchgrew. The chief reason

for her abhorrence was the old man's insensibility to the angelic

submission, the touching fragility, the heavenly meekness and

tranquillity, of Mrs. Maldon as she lay there helpless, victimized by

a paralytic affliction. (Rachel wanted to forget utterly the souvenir

of Mrs. Maldon's paroxysm in the night, because it slurred the

unmatched dignity of the aged creature.) Another reason was the mere

fact that Mr. Batchgrew had insisted on leaving the money in the

house. Who but Mr. Batchgrew would have had the notion of saddling

poor old Mrs. Maldon with the custody of a vast sum of money? It was a

shame; it was positively cruel! Rachel was indignantly convinced that

he alone ought to be made responsible for the money. And lastly, she

loathed and condemned him for the reason that he was so obviously

unequal to the situation. He could not handle it. He was found out. He

was disproved, He did not know what to do. He could only mouth, strut,

bully, and make rude noises. He could not even keep decently around

him the cloak of self-importance. He stood revealed to Mrs. Maldon and

Rachel as he had sometimes stood revealed to his dead wife and to his

elder children and to some of his confidential, faithful employees.

He was an offence in the delicacy of the bedroom. If the rancour of

Rachel's judgment had been fierce enough to strike him to the floor,

assuredly his years would not have saved him! And yet Mrs. Maldon

gazed at him with submissive and apologetic gentleness! Foolish saint!

Fancy her (thought Rachel) hardening her heart to Julian!

Rachel longed to stiffen her with some backing of her own harsh common

sense. And her affection for Mrs. Maldon grew passionate and half

maternal.

IV
Thomas Batchgrew was saying—
"It beats me how anybody in their senses could pick up a serviette and

put it way for a pile o' bank-notes." He scowled. "However, I'll go

and see Snow. I'll see what Snow says. I'll get him to come up with

one of his best men—Dickson, perhaps."
"Thomas Batchgrew!" cried Mrs. Maldon with sudden disturbing febrile

excitement. "You'll do no such thing. I'll have no police prying into

this affair. If you do that I shall just die right off."
And her manner grew so imperious that Mr. Batchgrew was intimidated.
"But—but—"
"I'd sooner lose all the money!" said Mrs. Maldon, almost wildly.
She blushed. And Rachel also felt herself to be blushing, and was

not sure whether she knew why she was blushing. An atmosphere of

constraint and shame seemed to permeate the room.
Mr. Batchgrew growled—
"The money must be in the house. The truth is, Elizabeth, ye don't

know no more than that bedpost where ye put it."
And Rachel agreed eagerly—
"Of course it must be in the house! I shall set to and turn

everything out. Everything!"
"Ye'd better!" said Thomas Batchgrew.
"That will be the best thing, dear—perhaps," said Mrs. Maldon,

indifferent, and now plainly fatigued.
Every one seemed determined to be convinced that the money was in the

house, and to employ this conviction as a defence against horrible dim

suspicions that had inexplicably emerged from the corners of the room

and were creeping about like menaces.
"Where else should it be?" muttered Batchgrew, sarcastically, after a

pause, as if to say, "Anybody who fancies the money isn't in the house

is an utter fool."
Mrs. Maldon had closed her eyes.
There was a faint knock at the door. Rachel turned instinctively to

prevent a possible intruder from entering and catching sight of

those dim suspicions before they could be driven back into their dark

corners. Then she remembered that she had asked Mrs. Tams to bring up

some Revalenta Arabica food for Mrs. Maldon as soon as it should be

ready. And she sedately opened the door. Mrs. Tams, with her usual

serf-like diffidence, remained invisible, except for the hand holding

forth the cup. But her soft voice, charged with sensational news, was

heard—
"Mrs. Grocott's boy next door but one has just been round to th' back

to tell me as there was a burglary down the Lane last night."
As Rachel carried the food across to the bed, she could not help

saying, though with feigned deference, to Mr. Batchgrew—
"You told us last night that there wouldn't be any more

burglaries, Mr. Batchgrew."
The burning tightness round the top of her head, due to fatigue and

lack of sleep, seemed somehow to brace her audacity, and to make her

careless of consequences.
The trustee and celebrity, though momentarily confounded, was

recovering himself now. He determined to crush the pert creature whose

glance had several times incommoded him. He said severely—
"What's a burglary down the Lane got to with us and this here money?"
"Us and the money!" Rachel repeated evenly. "Nothing, only when I came

downstairs in the night the greenhouse door was open." (The scullery

was still often called the greenhouse.) "And I'd locked it myself!"
A troubling silence followed, broken by Mr. Batchgrew's uneasy grunts

as he turned away to the window, and by the clink of the spoon as

Rachel helped Mrs. Maldon to take the food.
At length Mr. Batchgrew asked, staring through the window—
"Did ye notice the dust on top o' that cupboard? Was it disturbed?"
Hesitating an instant, Rachel answered firmly, without turning her

head—
"I did ... It was ... Of course."
Mrs. Maldon made no sign of interest.
Mr. Batchgrew's boots creaked to and fro in the room.
"And what's Julian got to say for himself?" he asked, not addressing

either woman in particular.
"Julian wasn't here. He didn't stay the night. Louis stayed instead,"

answered Mrs. Maldon, faintly, without opening her eyes.
"What? What? What's this?"
"Tell him, dear, how it was," said Mrs. Maldon, still more faintly.
Rachel obeyed, in agitated, uneven tones.

CHAPTER VI
THEORIES OF THE THEFT

I
The inspiring and agreeable image of Rachel floated above vast

contending forces of ideas in the mind of Louis Fores as he bent

over his petty-cash book amid the dust of the vile inner office at

Horrocleave's; and their altercation was sharpened by the fact that

Louis had not had enough sleep. He had had a great deal more sleep

than Rachel, but he had not had what he was in the habit of calling

his "whack" of it. Although never in a hurry to go to bed, he

appreciated as well as any doctor the importance of sleep in the

economy of the human frame, and his weekly average of repose was high;

he was an expert sleeper.
He thirsted after righteousness, and the petty-cash book was permeated

through and through with unrighteousness; and it was his handiwork. Of

course, under the unconscious influence of Rachel, seen in her kitchen

and seen also in various other striking aspects during the exciting

night, he might have bravely exposed the iniquity of the petty-cash

book to Jim Horrocleave, and cleared his conscience, and then gone and

confessed to Rachel, and thus prepared the way for the inner peace and

a new life. He would have suffered—there was indeed a possibility of

very severe suffering—but he would have been a free man—yes, free

even if in prison, and he would have followed the fine tradition of

rectitude, exhorting the respect and admiration of all true souls,

etc. He had read authentic records of similar deeds. What stopped him

from carrying out the programme of honesty was his powerful worldly

common sense. Despite what he had read, and despite the inspiring

image of Rachel, his common sense soon convinced him that confession

would be an error of judgment and quite unremunerative for, at any

rate, very many years. Hence he abandoned regretfully the notion of

confession, as a beautifully impossible dream. But righteousness was

not thereby entirely denied to him; his thirst for it could still be

assuaged by the device of an oath to repay secretly to Horrocleave

every penny that he had stolen from Horrocleave, which oath he

took—and felt better and worthier of Rachel.
He might, perhaps, have inclined more effectually towards confession

had not the petty-cash book appeared to him in the morning light as an

admirably convincing piece of work. It had the most innocent air,

and was markedly superior to his recollection of it. On many pages he

himself could scarcely detect his own traces. He began to feel that he

could rely pretty strongly on the cleverness of the petty-cash book.

Only four blank pages remained in it. A few days more and it would be

filled up, finished, labelled with a gummed white label showing

its number and the dates of its first and last entries, shelved and

forgotten. A pity that Horrocleave's suspicions had not been delayed

for another month or so, for then the book might have been mislaid,

lost, or even consumed in a conflagration! But never mind! A certain

amount of ill luck fell to every man, and he would trust to his

excellent handicraft in the petty-cash book. It was his only hope in

the world, now that the mysterious and heavenly bank-notes were gone.
His attitude towards the bank-notes was, quite naturally, illogical

and self-contradictory. While the bank-notes were in his pocket he had

in the end seen three things with clearness. First, the wickedness of

appropriating them. Second, the danger of appropriating them—having

regard to the prevalent habit of keeping the numbers of bank-notes.

Third, the wild madness of attempting to utilize them in order to

replace the stolen petty cash, for by no ingenuity could the presence

of a hoard of over seventy pounds in the petty-cash box have been

explained. He had perfectly grasped all that; and yet, the notes

having vanished, he felt forlorn, alone, as one who has lost his best

friend—a prop and firm succour in a universe of quicksands.
In the matter of the burning of the notes his conscience did not

accuse him. On the contrary, he emerged blameless from the episode. It

was not he who first had so carelessly left the notes lying about. He

had not searched for them, he had not purloined them. They had been

positively thrust upon him. His intention in assuming charge of them

for a brief space was to teach some negligent person a lesson. During

the evening Fate had given him no opportunity to produce them. And

when in the night, with honesty unimpeachable, he had decided to

restore them to the landing, Fate had intervened once more. At

each step of the affair he had acted for the best in difficult

circumstances. Persons so ill-advised as to drop bank-notes under

chairs must accept all the consequences of their act. Who could have

foreseen that while he was engaged on the philanthropic errand of

fetching a doctor for an aged lady Rachel would light a fire under

the notes?... No, not merely was he without sin in the matter of the

bank-notes, he was rather an ill-used person, a martyr deserving of

sympathy. And, further, he did not regret the notes; he was glad they

were gone. They could no longer tempt him now, and their disappearance

would remain a mystery for ever. So far as they were concerned, he

could look his aunt or anybody else in the face without a tremor. The

mere destruction of the immense, undetermined sum of money did not

seriously ruffle him. As an ex-bank clerk he was aware that though an

individual would lose, the State, through the Bank of England,

would correspondingly gain, and thus for the nonce he had the large

sensation of a patriot.

II
Axon, the factotum of the counting-house, came in from the outer

office, with a mien composed of mirth and apprehension in about equal

parts. If Axon happened to be a subject of a conversation and there

was any uncertainty as to which Axon out of a thousand Axons he

might be, the introducer of the subject would always say, "You

know—sandy-haired fellow." This described him—hair, beard,

moustache. Sandy-haired men have no age until they are fifty-five, and

Axon was not fifty-five. He was a pigeon-flyer by choice, and a clerk

in order that he might be a pigeon-flyer. His fault was that, with

no moral right whatever to do so, he would treat Louis Fores as a

business equal in the office and as a social equal in the street.
He sprang upon Louis now as one grinning valet might spring upon

another, enormous with news, and whispered—
"I say, guv'nor's put his foot through them steps from painting-shop

and sprained his ankle. Look out for ructions, eh? Thank the Lord it's

a half-day!" and then whipped back to his own room.
On any ordinary Saturday morning Louis by a fine frigidity would

have tried to show to the obtuse Axon that he resented such demeanour

towards himself on the part of an Axon, assuming as it did that the

art-director of the works was one of the servile crew that scuttled

about in terror if the ferocious Horrocleave happened to sneeze. But

to-day the mere sudden information that Horrocleave was on the works

gave him an unpleasant start and seriously impaired his presence of

mind. He had not been aware of Horrocleave's arrival. He had been

expecting to hear Horrocleave's step and voice, and the rustle of

him hanging up his mackintosh outside (Horrocleave always wore a

mackintosh instead of an overcoat), and all the general introductory

sounds of his advent, before he finally came into the inner room. But,

now, for aught Louis knew, Horrocleave might already have been in the

inner room, before Louis. He was upset. The enemy was not attacking

him in the proper and usual way.
And the next instant, ere he could collect and reorganize his forces,

he was paralysed by the footfall of Horrocleave, limping, and the bang

of a door.
And Louis thought—
"He's in the outer office. He's only got to take his mackintosh off,

and then I shall see his head coming through this door, and perhaps

he'll ask me for the petty-cash book right off."
But Horrocleave did not even pause to remove his mackintosh. In

defiance of immemorial habit, being himself considerably excited and

confused, he stalked straight in, half hopping, and sat down in his

frowsy chair at his frowsy desk, with his cap at the back of his head.

He was a spare man, of medium height, with a thin, shrewd face and a

constant look of hard, fierce determination.
And there was Louis staring like a fool at the open page of the

petty-cash book, incriminating himself every instant.
"Hello!" said Louis, without looking round. "What's up?"
"What's up?" Horrocleave scowled. "What d'ye mean?"
"I thought you were limping just the least bit in the world," said

Louis, whose tact was instinctive and indestructible.
"Oh, that!" said Horrocleave, as though nothing was farther

from his mind than the peculiarity of his gait that morning. He bit

his lip.
"Slipped over something?" Louis suggested.
"Aye!" said Horrocleave, somewhat less ominously, and began to open

his letters.
Louis saw that he had done well to feign ignorance of the sprain and

to assume that Horrocleave had slipped, whereas in fact Horrocleave

had put his foot through a piece of rotten wood. Everybody in the

works, upon pain of death, would have to pretend that the employer had

merely slipped, and that the consequences were negligible. Horrocleave

had already nearly eaten an old man alive for the sin of asking

whether he had hurt himself!
And he had not hurt himself because two days previously he had

ferociously stopped the odd-man of the works from wasting his time in

mending just that identical stair, and had asserted that the stair was

in excellent condition. Horrocleave, though Napoleonic by disposition,

had a provincial mind, even a Five Towns mind. He regarded as sheer

loss any expenditure on repairs or renewals or the processes of

cleansing. His theory was that everything would "do" indefinitely. He

passed much of his time in making things "do." His confidence in the

theory that things could indeed be made to "do" was usually justified,

but the steps from the painting-shop—a gimcrack ladder with

hand-rail, attached somehow externally to a wall—had at length

betrayed it. That the accident had happened to himself, and not to a

lad balancing a plankful of art-lustre ware on one shoulder, was sheer

luck. And now the odd-man, with the surreptitious air of one engaged

in a nefarious act, was putting a new tread on the stairs. Thus

devoutly are the Napoleonic served!
Horrocleave seemed to weary of his correspondence.
"By the by," he said in a strange tone, "let's have a look at that

petty-cash book."
Louis rose, and with all his charm, with all the elegance of a man

intended by Nature for wealth and fashion instead of a slave on a foul

pot-bank, gave up the book. It was like giving up hope to the last

vestige, like giving up the ghost. He saw with horrible clearness that

he had been deceiving himself, that Horrocleave's ruthless eye could

not fail to discern at the first glance all his neat dodges, such as

additions of ten to the shillings, and even to the pounds here and

there, and ingenious errors in carrying forward totals from the bottom

of one page to the top of the next. He began to speculate whether

Horrocleave would be content merely to fling him out of the office, or

whether he would prosecute. Prosecution seemed much more in accordance

with the Napoleonic temperament, and yet Louis could not, then,

conceive himself the victim of a prosecution.... Anybody else, but not

Louis Fores!
Horrocleave, his elbow on the table, leaned his head on his hand and

began to examine the book. Suddenly he looked up at Louis, who could

not move and could not cease from agreeably smiling.
Said Horrocleave in a still more peculiar tone—
"Just ask Axon whether he means to go fetch wages to-day or to-morrow.

Has he forgotten it's Saturday morning?"
Louis shot away into the outer office, where Axon was just putting on

his hat to go to the bank.
Alone in the outer office Louis wondered. The whole of his vitality

was absorbed in the single function of wondering. Then through the

thin slit of the half-open door between the top and the middle hinges,

he beheld Horrocleave bending in judgment over the book. And he

gazed at the vision in the fascination of horror. In a few moments

Horrocleave leaned back, and Louis saw that his face had turned paler.

It went almost white. Horrocleave was breathing strangely, his arms

dropped downward, his body slipped to one side, his cap fell off, his

eyes shut, his mouth opened, his head sank loosely over the back

of the chair like the head of a corpse. He had fainted. The

thought passed through Louis' mind that stupefaction at the complex

unrighteousness of the petty-cash records had caused Horrocleave to

lose consciousness. Then the true explanation occurred to him. It was

the pain in his ankle that had overcome the heroic sufferer. Louis

had desired to go to his aid, but he could not budge from his post.

Presently the colour began slowly to return to Horrocleave's cheek;

his eyes opened; he looked round sleepily and then wildly; and then he

rubbed his eyes and yawned. He remained quiescent for several minutes,

while a railway lorry thundered through the archway and the hoofs of

the great horse crunched on shawds in the yard. Then he called, in a

subdued voice—
"Louis! Where the devil are ye?"
Louis re-entered the room, and as he did so Horrocleave shut the

petty-cash book with an abrupt gesture.
"Here, take it!" said he, pushing the book away.
"Is it all right?" Louis asked.
Horrocleave nodded. "Well, I've checked about forty additions." And he

smiled sardonically.
"I think you might do it a bit oftener," said Louis, and then went on:

"I say, don't you think it might be a good thing if you took your boot

off. You never know, when you've slipped, whether it won't swell—I

mean the ankle."
"Bosh!" exclaimed Horrocleave, with precipitation, but after an

instant added thoughtfully: "Well, I dun'no'. Wouldn't do any harm,

would it? I say—get me some water, will you? I don't know how it is,

but I'm as thirsty as a dog."
The heroic martyr to the affirmation that he had not hurt himself had

handsomely saved his honour. He could afford to relax a little now the

rigour of consistency in conduct. With twinges and yawns he permitted

Louis to help him with the boot and to put an art-lustre cup to his

lips.
Louis was in the highest spirits. He had seen the gates of the

Inferno, and was now snatched up to Paradise. He knew that Horrocleave

had never more than half suspected him, and that the terrible

Horrocleave pride would prevent Horrocleave from asking for the

book again. Henceforth, saved by a miracle, he could live in utter

rectitude; he could respond freely to the inspiring influence of

Rachel, and he would do so. He smiled at his previous fears, and was

convinced, by no means for the first time, that a Providence watched

over him because of his good intentions and his nice disposition—that

nothing really serious could ever occur to Louis Fores. He reflected

happily that in a few days he would begin a new petty-cash book—and

he envisaged it as a symbol of his new life. The future smiled. He

made sure that his aunt Maldon was dying, and though he liked her very

much and would regret her demise, he could not be expected to be blind

to the fact that a proportion of her riches would devolve on himself.

Indeed, in unluckily causing a loss of money to his aunt Maldon he had

in reality only been robbing himself. So that there was no need for

any kind of remorse. When the works closed for the week-end, he

walked almost serenely up to Bycars for news—news less of his aunt's

condition than of the discovery that a certain roll of bank-notes had

been mislaid.

III
The front door was open when Louis arrived at Mrs. Maldon's house, and

he walked in. Anybody might have walked in. There was nothing unusual

in this; it was not a sign that the mistress of the house was ill in

bed and its guardianship therefore disorganized. The front doors of

Bursley—even the most select—were constantly ajar and the fresh wind

from off the pot-bank was constantly blowing through those exposed

halls and up those staircases. For the demon of public inquisitiveness

is understood in the Five Towns to be a nocturnal demon. The fear

of it begins only at dusk. A woman who in the evening protects her

parlour like her honour, will, while the sun is above the horizon,

show the sacred secrets of the kitchen itself to any one who chooses

to stand on the front step.
Louis put his hat and stick on the oak chest, and with a careless,

elegant gesture brushed back his dark hair. The door of the parlour

was slightly ajar. He pushed it gently open, and peeped round it with

a pleasant arch expression, on the chance of there being some one

within.
Rachel was lying on the Chesterfield. Her left cheek, resting on her

left hand, was embedded in the large cushion. A large coil of her

tawny hair, displaced, had spread loosely over the dark green of the

sofa. The left foot hung limp over the edge of the sofa; the jutting

angle of the right knee divided sharply the drapery of her petticoat

into two systems, and her right shoe with its steel buckle pressed

against the yielding back of the Chesterfield. The right arm lay

lissom like a snake across her breast. All her muscles were lax,

and every full curve of her body tended downward in response to the

negligent pose. Her eyes were shut, her face flushed; and her chest

heaved with the slow regularity of her deep, unconscious breathing.
Louis as he gazed was enchanted. This was not Miss Fleckring, the

companion and household help of Mrs. Maldon, but a nymph, a fay, the

universal symbol of his highest desire.... He would have been happy to

kiss the glinting steel buckle, so feminine, so provocative, so coy.

The tight rounded line of the waist, every bend of the fingers, the

fall of the eye-lashes—all were exquisite and precious to him after

the harsh, unsatisfying, desolating masculinity of Horrocleave's.

This was the divine reward of Horrocleave's, the sole reason of

Horrocleave's. Horrocleave's only existed in order that this might

exist and be maintained amid cushions and the softness of calm and

sequestered interiors, waiting for ever in acquiescence for the

arrival of manful doers from Horrocleave's. The magnificent pride of

male youth animated Louis. He had not a care in the world. Even

his long-unpaid tailor's bill was magically abolished. He was an

embodiment of exulting hope and fine aspirations.
Rachel stirred, dimly aware of the invasion. And Louis, actuated by

the most delicate regard for her sensitive modesty, vanished back for

a moment into the hall, until she should have fitted herself for his

beholding.
Mrs. Tams had come from somewhere into the hall. She was munching a

square of bread and cold bacon, and she curtsied, exclaiming—
"It's never Mester Fores! That's twice her's been woke up this day!"
"Who's there?" Rachel called out, and her voice had the breaking,

bewildered softness of a woman's in the dark, emerging from a dream.
"Sorry! Sorry!" said Louis, behind the door.
"It's all right," she reassured him.
He returned to the room. She was sitting upright on the sofa, her arms

a little extended and the tips of her fingers touching the sofa. The

coil of her hair had been arranged. The romance of the exciting night

still clung to her, for Louis; but what chiefly seduced him was the

mingling in her mien of soft confusion and candid, sturdy honesty and

dependableness. He felt that here was not only a ravishing charm, but

a source of moral strength from which he could draw inexhaustibly that

which he had had a slight suspicion he lacked. He felt that here was

joy and salvation united, and it seemed too good to be true. Strange

that when she greeted him at the door-step on the previous evening, he

had imagined that she was revealing herself to him for the first

time; and again later, in the kitchen, he had imagined that she was

revealing herself to him for the first time; and again, still later,

in the sudden crisis at his bedroom door, he had imagined that she was

revealing herself to him for the first time. For now he perceived that

he had never really seen her before; and he was astounded and awed.
"Auntie still on the up-grade?" he inquired, using all his own charm.

He guessed, of course, that Mrs. Maldon must be still better, and he

was very glad, although, if she recovered, it would be she and not

himself that he had deprived of bank-notes.
"Oh yes, she's better," said Rachel, not moving from the sofa; "but

have you heard what's happened?"
In spite of himself he trembled, awaiting the disclosure. "Now for the

bank-notes!" he reflected, bracing his nerves. He shook his head.
She told him what had happened; she told him at length, quickening

her speech as she proceeded. And for a few moments it was as if he

was being engulfed by an enormous wave, and would drown. But the next

instant he recollected that he was on dry land, safe, high beyond the

reach of any catastrophe. His position was utterly secure. The past

was past; the leaf was turned. He had but to forget, and he was

confident of his ability to forget. The compartments of his mind were

innumerable, and as separate as the dungeons of a mediaeval prison.
"Isn't it awful?" she murmured.
"Well, it is rather awful!"
"Nine hundred and sixty-five pounds! Fancy it!"
The wave approached him again as she named the sum. Nevertheless,

he never once outwardly blenched. As he had definitely put away

unrighteousness, so his face showed no sign of guilt. Like many

ingenuous-minded persons, he had in a high degree the faculty of

appearing innocent—except when he really was innocent.
"If you ask me," said Rachel, "she never took any of the notes

upstairs at all; she left them all somewhere downstairs and only took

the serviette upstairs."
"Yes," he agreed thoughtfully, wondering whether on the other hand,

Mrs. Maldon had not taken all the notes upstairs, and left none of

them downstairs. Was it possible that in that small roll, in that

crushed ball that he had dropped into the grate, there was nearly a

thousand pounds—the equivalent of an income of a pound a week

for ever and ever?... Never mind! The incident, so far as he was

concerned, was closed. The dogma of his future life would be that the

bank-notes had never existed.
"And I've looked ev'rywhere!" Rachel insisted with strong

emphasis.
Louis remarked, thoughtfully, as though a new aspect of the affair was

presenting itself to him—
"It's really rather serious, you know!"
"I should just say it was—as much money as that!"
"I mean," said Louis, "for everybody. That is to say, Julian and me.

We're involved."
"How can you be involved? You didn't even know it was in the house."
"No. But the old lady might have dropped it. I might have picked it

up. Julian might have picked it up. Who's to prove—"
She cut in coldly—
"Please don't talk like that!"
He smiled with momentary constraint. He said to himself—
"It won't do to talk to this kind of girl like that. She won't stand

it.... Why, she wouldn't even dream of suspicion falling on

herself—wouldn't dream of it."
After a silence he began—
"Well—" and made a gesture to imply that the enigma baffled him.
"I give it up!" breathed Rachel intimately. "I fairly give it up!"
"And of course that was the cause of her attack?" he said suddenly, as

if the idea had just occurred to him.
Rachel nodded—"Evidently."
"Well," said he, "I'll look in again during the afternoon. I must

be getting along for my grub." He was hoping that he had not

unintentionally brought about his aunt's death.
"Not had your dinner!" she cried. "Why! It's after half-past two!"
"Oh, well, you know ... Saturday...."
"I shall get you a bit of dinner here," she said. "And then perhaps

Mrs. Maldon will be waking up. Yes," she repeated, positively, "I

shall get you a bit of dinner here, myself. Mrs. Maldon would not be

at all pleased if I didn't."
"I'm frightfully hungry," he admitted.
And he was.
When she had left the parlour he perceived evidences here and there

that she had been hunting up hill and down dale for the notes; and he

went into the back room with an earnest, examining air, as though

he might find part of the missing hoard, after all, in some niche

overlooked by Rachel. He would have preferred to think that Mrs.

Maldon had not taken the whole of the money upstairs, but reflection

did much to convince him that she had. It was infinitely regrettable

that he had not counted his treasure-trove under the chair.

IV
The service of his meal, which had the charm of a picnic, was

interrupted by the arrival of the doctor, whose report on the invalid,

however, was so favourable that Louis could quite dismiss the possibly

homicidal aspect of his dealings with the bank-notes. The shock of the

complete disappearance of the vast sum had perhaps brought Mrs.

Maldon to the brink of death, but she had edged safely away again,

in accordance with her own calm prophecy that very morning. When the

doctor had gone, and the patient was indulged in her desire to be

left alone for sleep, Louis very slowly and luxuriously finished his

repast, with Rachel sitting opposite to him, in Mrs. Maldon's place,

at the dining-table. He lit a cigarette and, gracefully leaning

his elbows on the table, gazed at her through the beautiful grey

smoke-veil, which was like the clouds of Paradise.
What thrilled Louis was the obvious fact that he fascinated her. She

was transformed under his glance. How her eyes shone! How her cheek

flushed and paled! What passionate vitality found vent in her little

gestures! But in the midst of this transformation her honesty,

her loyalty, her exquisite ingenuousness, her superb dependability

remained. She was no light creature, no flirt nor seeker after dubious

sensations. He felt that at last he was appreciated by one whose

appreciation was tremendously worth having. He was confirmed in that

private opinion of himself that no mistakes hitherto made in his

career had been able to destroy. He felt happy and confident as never

before.
Luck, of course; but luck deserved! He could marry this unique

creature and be idolized and cherished for the rest of his life. In

an instant, from being a scorner of conjugal domesticity, he became

a scorner of the bachelor's existence, with its immeasurable secret

ennui hidden beneath the jaunty cloak of a specious freedom—freedom

to be bored, freedom to fret, and long and envy, freedom to eat ashes

and masticate dust! He would marry her. Yes, he was saved, because he

was loved. And he meant to be worthy of his regenerate destiny. All

the best part of his character came to the surface and showed in his

face. But he did not ask his heart whether he was or was not in love

with Rachel. The point did not present itself. He certainly never

doubted that he was seeing her with a quite normal vision.
Their talk went through and through the enormous topic of the night

and day, arriving at no conclusion whatever, except that there was no

conclusion—not even a theory of a conclusion. (And the Louis who now

discussed the case was an innocent, reborn Louis, quite unconnected

with the Louis of the previous evening; he knew no more of the

inwardness of the affair than Rachel did. Of such singular feats of

doubling the personality is the self-deceiving mind capable.) After

a time it became implicit in the tone of their conversation that

the mysterious disappearance in a small, ordinary house of even so

colossal a sum as nine hundred and sixty-five pounds did not mean

the end of the world. That is to say, they grew accustomed to the

situation. Louis, indeed, permitted himself to suggest, as a man of

the large, still-existing world, that Rachel should guard against

over-estimating the importance of the sum. True, as he had several

times reflected, it did represent an income of about a pound a

week! But, after all, what was a pound a week, viewed in a proper

perspective?...
Louis somehow glided from the enormous topic to the topic of the

newest cinema—Rachel had never seen a cinema, except a very primitive

one, years earlier—and old Batchgrew was mentioned, he being

notoriously a cinema magnate. "I cannot stand that man," said Rachel

with a candour that showed to what intimacy their talk had developed.

Louis was delighted by the explosion, and they both fell violently

upon Thomas Batchgrew and found intense pleasure in destroying him.

And Louis was saying to himself, enthusiastically, "How well she

understands human nature!"
So that when old Batchgrew, without any warning or preliminary sound,

stalked pompously into the room their young confusion was excessive.

They felt themselves suddenly in the presence of not merely a personal

adversary, but of an enemy of youth and of love and of joy—of a being

mysterious and malevolent who neither would nor could comprehend them.

And they were at once resentful and intimidated.
During the morning Councillor Batchgrew had provided

himself—doubtless by purchase, since he had not been home—with a

dandiacal spotted white waistcoat in honour of the warm and sunny

weather. This waistcoat by its sprightly unsuitability to his

aged uncouthness, somehow intensified the sinister quality of his

appearance.
"Found it?" he demanded tersely.
Rachel, strangely at a loss, hesitated and glanced at Louis as if for

succour.
"No, I haven't, Mr. Batchgrew," she said. "I haven't, I'm sure. And

I've turned over every possible thing likely or unlikely."
Mr. Batchgrew growled—
"From th' look of ye I made sure that th' money had turned up all

right—ye were that comfortable and cosy! Who'd guess as nigh on a

thousand pound's missing out of this house since last night!"
The heavy voice rolled over them brutally. Louis attempted to

withstand Mr. Batchgrew's glare, but failed. He was sure of the

absolute impregnability of his own position; but the clear memory

of at least one humiliating and disastrous interview with Thomas

Batchgrew in the past robbed Louis' eye of its composure. The

circumstances under which he had left the councillor's employ some

years ago were historic and unforgettable.
"I came in back way instead of front way," said Thomas Batchgrew,

"because I thought I'd have a look at that scullery door. Kitchen's

empty."
"What about the scullery door?" Louis lightly demanded.
Rachel murmured—
"I forgot to tell you; it was open when I came down in the middle of

the night." And then she added: "Wide open."
"Upon my soul!" said Louis slowly, with marked constraint. "I really

forget whether I looked at that door before I went to bed. I know I

looked at all the others."
"I'd looked at it, anyway," said Rachel defiantly, gazing at the

table.
"And when you found it open, miss," pursued Thomas Batchgrew, "what

did ye do?"
"I shut it and locked it."
"Where was the key?"
"In the door."
"Lock in order?"
"Yes."
"Well, then, how could it have been opened from the outside? There

isn't a mark on the door, outside or in."
"As far as that goes, Mr. Batchgrew," said Rachel, "only last week the

key fell out of the lock on the inside and slid down the brick floor

to the outside—you know there's a slope. And I had to go out of the

house by the front and the lamplighter climbed over the back gate for

me and let me into the yard so that I could get the key again. That

might have happened last night. Some one might have shaken the key

out, and pulled it under the door with a bit of wire or something."
"That won't do," Thomas Batchgrew stopped her. "You said the key was

in the door on the inside."
"Well, when they'd once opened the door from the outside, couldn't

they have put the key on the inside again?"
"They? Who?"
"Burglars."
Thomas Batchgrew repeated sarcastically—
"Burglars! Burglars!" and snorted.
"Well, Mr. Batchgrew, either burglars must have been at work," said

Louis, who was fascinated by Rachel's surprising news and equally

surprising theory—"either burglars must have been at work," he

repeated impressively, "or—the money is still in the house.

That's evident."
"Is it?" snarled Batchgrew. "Look here, miss, and you, young Fores, I

didn't make much o' this this morning, because I thought th' money 'ud

happen be found. But seeing as it isn't, and as we're talking

about it, what time was the rumpus last night?"
"What time?" Rachel muttered. "What time was it, Mr. Fores?"
"I dun'no'," said Louis. "Perhaps the doctor would know."
"Oh!" said Rachel, "Mrs. Tams said the hall clock had stopped; that

must have been when Mrs. Maldon knocked up against it."
She went to the parlour door and opened it, displaying the hall clock,

which showed twenty-five minutes past twelve. Louis had crept up

behind Mr. Batchgrew, who in his inapposite white waistcoat stood

between the two lovers, stertorous with vague anathema.
"So that was the time," said he. "And th' burglars must ha' been and

gone afore that. A likely thing burglars coming at twelve o'clock

at night, isn't it? And I'll tell ye summat else. Them burglars was

copped last night at Knype at eleven o'clock when th' pubs closed, if

ye want to know—the whole gang of three on 'em."
"Then what about that burglary last night down the Lane?" Rachel asked

sharply.
"Oh!" exclaimed Louis. "Was there a burglary down the Lane last night?

I didn't know that."
"No, there wasn't," said Batchgrew ruthlessly. "That burglary was a

practical joke, and it's all over the town. Denry Machin had a hand in

that affair, and by now I dare say he wishes he hadn't."
"Still, Mr. Batchgrew," Louis argued superiorly, with the philosophic

impartiality of a man well accustomed to the calm unravelling of

crime, "there may be other burglars in the land beside just those

three." He would not willingly allow the theory of burglars to

crumble. Its attractiveness increased every moment.
"There may and there mayn't, young Fores," said Thomas Batchgrew. "Did

you hear anything of 'em?"
"No, I didn't," Louis replied restively.
"And yet you ought to have been listening out for 'em."
"Why ought I to have been listening out for them?"
"Knowing there was all that money in th' house."
"Mr. Fores didn't know," said Rachel.
Louis felt himself unjustly smirched.
"It's scarcely an hour ago," said he, "that I heard about this money

for the first time." And he felt as innocent and aggrieved as he

looked.
Mr. Batchgrew smacked his lips loudly.
"Then," he announced, "I'm going down to th' police-station, to put it

i' Snow's hands."
Rachel straightened herself.
"But surely not without telling Mrs. Maldon?"
Mr. Batchgrew fingered his immense whiskers.
"Is she better?" he inquired threateningly. This was his first sign of

interest in Mrs. Maldon's condition.
"Oh, yes; much. She's going on very well. The doctor's just been."
"Is she asleep?"
"She's resting. She may be asleep."
"Did ye tell her ye hadn't found her money?"
"Yes."
"What did she say?"
"She didn't say anything."
"It might be municipal money, for all she seems to care!" remarked

Thomas Batchgrew, with a short, bitter grin. "Well, I'll be moving to

th' police-station. I've never come across aught like this before, and

I'm going to get to the bottom of it."
Rachel slipped out of the door into the hall.
"Please wait a moment, Mr. Batchgrew," she whispered timidly.
"What for?"
"Till I've told Mrs. Maldon."
"But if her's asleep?"
"I must waken her. I couldn't think of letting you go to the

police-station without letting her know—after what she said this

morning."
Rachel waited. Mr. Batchgrew glanced aside.
"Here! Come here!" said Mr. Batchgrew in a different tone. The fact

was that, put to the proof, he dared not, for all his autocratic

habit, openly disobey the injunction of the benignant, indifferent,

helpless Mrs. Maldon. "Come here!" he repeated coarsely. Rachel

obeyed, shamefaced despite herself. Batchgrew shut the door. "Now,"

he said grimly, "what's your secret? Out with it. I know you and her's

got a secret. What is it?"
Rachel sat down on the sofa, hid her face in her hands, and startled

both men by a sob. She wept with violence. And then through her tears,

and half looking up, she cried out passionately: "It's all your fault.

Why did you leave the money in the house at all? You know you'd no

right to do it, Mr. Batchgrew!"
The councillor was shaken out of his dignity by the incredible

impudence of this indictment from a chit like Rachel. Similar

experiences, however, had happened to him before; for, though as a

rule people most curiously conspired with him to keep up the fiction

that he was sacred, at rare intervals somebody's self-control would

break down, and bitter, inconvenient home truths would resound in

the ear of Thomas Batchgrew. But he would recover himself in a few

moments, and usually some diversion would occur to save him—he was

nearly always lucky. A diversion occurred now, of the least expected

kind. The cajoling tones of Mrs. Tams were heard on the staircase.
"Nay, ma'am! Nay, ma'am! This'll never do. Must I go on my bended

knees to ye?"
And then the firm but soft voice of Mrs. Maldon—
"I must speak to Mr. Batchgrew. I must have Mr. Batchgrew here at

once. Didn't you hear me call and call to you?"
"That I didn't, ma'am! I was beating the feather bed in the back

bedroom. Nay, not a step lower do you go, ma'am, not if I lose me job

for it."
Thomas Batchgrew and Louis were already out in the hall. Half-way down

the stairs stood Mrs. Maldon, supporting herself by the banisters and

being supported by Mrs. Tams. She was wearing her pink peignoir with

white frills at the neck and wrists. Her black hair was loose on her

shoulders like the hair of a young girl. Her pallid and heavily seamed

features with the deep shining eyes trembled gently, as if in response

to a distant vibration. She gazed upon the two silent men with

an expression that united benignancy with profound inquietude and

sadness. All her past life was in her face, inspiring it with strength

and sorrow.
"Mr. Batchgrew," she said. "I've heard your voice for a long time. I

want to speak to you."
And then she turned, yielded to the solicitous alarm of Mrs. Tams,

climbed feebly up the stairs, and vanished round the corner at the

top. And Mrs. Tams, putting her frowsy head for an instant over the

hand-rail, stopped to adjure Mr. Batchgrew—
"Eh, mester; ye'd better stop where ye are awhile."
From the parlour came the faint sobbing of Rachel.
The two men had not a word to say. Mr. Batchgrew grunted, vacillating.

It seemed as if the majestic apparition of Mrs. Maldon had rebuked

everything that was derogatory and undignified in her trustee, and

that both he and Louis were apologizing to the empty hall for being

common, base creatures. Each of them—and especially Louis—had

the sense of being awakened to events of formidable grandeur whose

imminence neither had suspected. Still assuring himself that his

position was absolutely safe, Louis nevertheless was aware of a

sinking in the stomach. He could rebut any accusation. "And yet ...!"

murmured his craven conscience. What could be the enigma between Mrs.

Maldon and Rachel? He was now trying to convince himself that Mrs.

Maldon had in fact divided the money into two parts, of which he had

handled only one, and that the impressive mystery had to do with the

other part of the treasure, which he had neither seen nor touched.

How, then, could he personally be threatened? "And yet!..." said his

conscience again.
In about a minute Mrs. Tarns reappeared at the head of the stairs.
"Her will have ye, mester!" said she to the councillor.
Thomas Batchgrew mounted after her.
Louis made a noise with his tongue as if starting a horse, and

returned to the parlour.
Rachel, still on the sofa, showed her wet face.
"I've got no secret," she said passionately. "And I'm sure Mrs. Maldon

hasn't. What's he driving at?"
The natural freedom of her gestures and vehement accent was enchanting

to Louis.
She jumped from the Chesterfield and ran away upstairs, flying.

He followed to the lobby, and saw her dash into her own room and

feverishly shut the door, which was in full view at the top of

the stairs. And Louis thought he had never lived in any moment so

exquisite and so alarming as that moment.
He was now alone on the ground floor. He caught no sound from above.
"Well, I'd better get out of this," he said to himself. "Anyhow, I'm

all right!... What a girl! Terrific!" And, lighting a fresh cigarette,

he left the house.

V
"And now what's amiss?" Thomas Batchgrew demanded, alone with Mrs.

Maldon in the tranquillity of the bedroom.
Mrs. Maldon lay once more in bed; the bedclothes covered her without

a crease, and from the neat fold-back of the white sheet her wrinkled

ivory face and curving black hair emerged so still and calm that her

recent flight to the stairs seemed unreal, impossible. The impression

her mien gave was that she never had moved and never would move from

the bed. Thomas Batchgrew's blusterous voice frankly showed acute

irritation. He was angry because nine hundred and sixty-five pounds

had monstrously vanished, because the chance of a good investment was

lost, because Mrs. Maldon tied his hands, because Rachel had forgotten

her respect and his dignity in addressing him; but more because he

felt too old to impose himself by sheer rough-riding, individual

force on the other actors in the drama, and still more because he, and

nobody else, had left the nine hundred and sixty-five pounds in the

house. What an orgy of denunciation he would have plunged into had

some other person insisted on leaving the money in the house with a

similar result!
Mrs. Maldon looked up at him with a glance of compassion. She was

filled with pity for him because he had arrived at old age without

dignity and without any sense of what was fine in life; he was not

even susceptible to the chastening influences of a sick-room. She

knew, indeed, that he hated and despised sickness in others, and

that when ill himself he became a moaning mass of cowardice and

vituperation. And in her heart she invented the most wonderful excuses

for him, and transformed him into a martyr of destiny who had suffered

both through ancestry and through environment. Was it his fault that

he was thus tragically defective? So that by the magic power of her

benevolence he became dignified in spite of himself.
She said—
"Mr. Batchgrew, I want you to oblige me by not discussing my affairs

with any one but me."
At that moment the front door closed firmly below, and the bedroom

vibrated.
"Is that Louis going?" she asked.
Batchgrew went to the window and looked downward, lowering the pupils

as far as possible so as to see the pavement.
"It's Louis going," he replied.
Mrs. Maldon sighed relief.
Mr. Batchgrew said no more.
"What were you talking about downstairs to those two?" Mrs. Maldon

went on carefully.
"What d'ye suppose we were talking about?" retorted Batchgrew,

still at the window. Then he turned towards her and proceeded in an

outburst: "If you want to know, missis, I was asking that young wench

what the secret was between you and her."
"The secret? Between Rachel and me?"
"Aye! Ye both know what's happened to them notes, and ye've made it up

between ye to say nowt!"
Mrs. Maldon answered gravely—
"You are quite mistaken. I know nothing, and I'm sure Rachel doesn't.

And we have made nothing up between us. How can you imagine such

things?"
"Why don't ye have the police told?"
"I cannot do with the police in my house."
Mr. Batchgrew approached the bed almost threateningly.
"I'll tell you why ye won't have the police told. Because ye know

Louis Fores has taken your money. It's as plain as a pikestaff. Ye put

it on the chair on the landing here, and ye left it there, and he came

along and pocketed it." Mrs. Maldon essayed to protest, but he cut her

short. "Did he or did he not come upstairs after ye'd been upstairs

yourself?"
As Mrs. Maldon hesitated, Thomas Batchgrew began to feel younger and

more impressive.
"Yes, he did," said Mrs. Maldon at length. "But only because I asked

him to come up—to fasten the window."
"What window?"
"The landing window."
Mr. Batchgrew, startled and delighted by this unexpected confirmation

of his theory, exploded—
"Ha!... And how soon was that after ye'd been upstairs with the

notes?"
"It was just afterwards."
"Ha!... I don't mind telling ye I've been suspecting that young man

ever since this morning. I only learnt just now as he was in th' house

all night. That made me think for a moment as he'd done it after ye'd

all gone to bed. And for aught I know he may have. But done it some

time he has, and you know it as well as I do, Elizabeth."
Mrs. Maldon maintained her serenity.
"We may be unjust to him. I should never forgive myself if I was. He

has a very good side to him, has Louis!"
"I've never seen it," said Mr. Batchgrew, still growing in authority.

"He began as a thief and he'll end as a thief, if it's no worse."
"Began as a thief?" Mrs. Maldon protested.
"Well, what d'ye suppose he left the bank for?"
"I never knew quite why he left the bank. I always understood there

was some unpleasantness."
"If ye didn't know, it was because ye didn't want to know. Ye never do

want to know these things. 'Unpleasantness!' There's only one sort of

unpleasantness with the clerks in a bank!... I know, anyhow,

because I took the trouble to find out for myself, when I had that

bother with him in my own office. And a nice affair that was, too!"
"But you told me at the time that his books were all right with you.

Only you preferred not to keep him." Mrs. Maiden's voice was now

plaintive.
Thomas Batchgrew came close to the bed and leaned on the foot of it.
"There's some things as you won't hear, Elizabeth. His books were all

right, but he'd made 'em all right. I got hold of him afore he'd done

more than he could undo—that's all. There's one trifle as I might

ha' told ye if ye hadn't such a way of shutting folks up sometimes,

missis. I'll tell ye now. Louis Fores went down on his knees to me in

my office. On his knees, and all blubbing. What about that?"
Mrs. Maldon replied—
"You must have been glad ever since that you did give the poor boy

another chance."
"There's nothing I've regretted more," said Thomas Batchgrew, with a

grimness that became him. "I heard last week he's keeping books and

handling cash for Horrocleave nowadays. I know how that'll end! I'd

warn Horrocleave, but it's no business o' mine, especially as ye made

me help ye to put him into Horrocleave's.... There's half a dozen

people in this town and in Hanbridge that can add up Louis Fores, and

have added him up! And now he's robbed ye in yer own house. But it

makes no matter. He's safe enough!" He sardonically snorted. "He's

safe enough. We canna' even stop the notes without telling the police,

and ye won't have the police told. Oh, no! He's managed to get on th'

right side o' you. However, he'll only finish in one way, that chap

will, whether you and me's here to see it or not."
Mr. Batchgrew had grown really impressive, and he knew it.
"Don't let us be hard," pleaded Mrs. Maldon. And then, in a firmer,

prouder voice: "There will be no scandal in my family, Mr. Batchgrew,

as long as I live."
Mr. Batchgrew's answer was superb in its unconscious ferocity—
"That depends how long ye live."
His meaningless eyes rested on her with frosty impartiality, as he

reflected—
"I wonder how long she'll last."
He felt strong; he felt immortal. Exactly like Mrs. Maldon, he was

convinced that he was old only by the misleading arithmetic of years,

that he was not really old, and that there was a subtle and vital

difference between all other people of his age and himself. As for

Mrs. Maldon, he regarded her as a mere poor relic of an organism.
"At our age," Mrs. Maldon began, and paused as if collecting her

thoughts.
"At our age! At our age!" he repeated, sharply deprecating the phrase.
"At our age," said Mrs. Maldon, with slow insistence, "we ought not to

be hard on others. We ought to be thinking of our own sins."
But, although Mrs. Maldon was perhaps the one person on earth whom he

both respected and feared, Thomas Batchgrew listened to her injunction

only with rough disdain. He was incapable of thinking of his own sins.

While in health, he was nearly as unaware of sin as an animal.
Nevertheless, he turned uneasily in the silence of the pale room, so

full of the shy and prim refinement of Mrs. Maldon's individuality.

He could talk morals to others in the grand manner, and with positive

enjoyment, but to be sermonized himself secretly exasperated him

because it constrained him and made him self-conscious. Invariably,

when thus attacked, he would execute a flank movement.
He said bluntly—
"And I suppose ye'll let him marry this Rachel girl if he's a mind

to!"
Slowly a deep flush covered Mrs. Maldon's face.
"What makes you say that?" she questioned, with rising agitation.
"I have but just seen 'em together."
Mrs. Maldon moved nervously in the bed.
"I should never forgive myself if I stood by and let Louis marry

Rachel," she said, and there was a sudden desperate urgency in her

voice.
"Isn't she good enough for a nephew o' yours?"
"She's good enough for any man," said Mrs. Maldon quietly.
"Then it's him as isna' good enough! And yet, if he's got such a good

side to him as ye say—" Mr. Batchgrew snorted.
"He's not suited to her—not at all."
"Now, missis," said Mr. Batchgrew in triumph, "at last we're getting

down to your real opinion of young Fores."
"I feel I'm responsible for Rachel, and—What ought I to do about it?"
"Do? What can a body do when a respectable young woman wi' red hair

takes a fancy to a youth? Nowt, Elizabeth. That young woman'll marry

Louis Fores, and ye can take it from me."
"But why do you say a thing like that? I only began to notice anything

myself last night."
"She's lost her head over him, that's all. I caught 'em just now....

As thick as thieves in your parlour!"
"But I'm by no means sure that he's smitten with her."
"What does it matter whether he is or not? She's lost her head over

him, and she'll have him. It doesn't want a telescope to see as far as

that."
"Well, then, I shall speak to her—I shall speak to her to-morrow

morning, after she's had a good night's rest, when I feel stronger."
"Ay! Ye may! And what shalt say?"
"I shall warn her. I think I shall know how to do it," said Mrs.

Maldon, with a certain air of confidence amid her trouble. "I wouldn't

run the risk of a tragedy for worlds."
"It's no risk of a tragedy, as ye call it," said Thomas

Batchgrew, very pleased with his own situation in the argument. "It's

a certainty. She'll believe him afore she believes you, whatever ye

say. You mark me. It's a certainty."
After elaborate preparations of his handkerchief, he blew his nose

loudly, because blowing his nose loudly affected him in an agreeable

manner.
A few minutes later he left, saying the car would be waiting for him

at the back of the Town Hall. And Mrs. Maldon lay alone until Mrs.

Tams came in with a tray.
"An' I hope that's enough company for one day!" said Mrs. Tarns. "Now,

sup it up, do!"

CHAPTER VII
THE CINEMA

I
That evening Rachel sat alone in the parlour, reclining on

the Chesterfield over the Signal. She had picked up the

Signal in order to read about captured burglars, but the paper

contained not one word on the subject, or on any other subject except

football. The football season had commenced in splendour, and it

happened to be the football edition of the Signal that the

paper-boy had foisted upon Mrs. Maldon's house. Despite repeated and

positive assurances from Mrs. Maldon that she wanted the late edition

and not the football edition on Saturday nights, the football edition

was usually delivered, because the paper-boy could not conceive that

any customer could sincerely not want the football edition. Rachel was

glancing in a torpid condition at the advertisements of the millinery

and trimming shops.
She would have been more wakeful could she have divined the blow

which she had escaped a couple of hours before. Between five and six

o'clock, when she was upstairs in the large bedroom, Mrs. Maldon

had said to her, "Rachel—" and stopped. "Yes, Mrs. Maldon," she had

replied. And Mrs. Maldon had said, "Nothing." Mrs. Maldon had desired

to say, but in words carefully chosen: "Rachel, I've never told you

that Louis Fores began life as a bank clerk, and was dismissed

for stealing money. And even since then his conduct has not been

blameless." Mrs. Maldon had stopped because she could not find the

form of words which would permit her to impart to her paid companion

this information about her grand-nephew. Mrs. Maldon, when the moment

for utterance came, had discovered that she simply could not do it,

and all her conscientious regard for Rachel and all her sense of duty

were not enough to make her do it. So that Rachel, unsuspectingly, had

been spared a tremendous emotional crisis. By this time she had grown

nearly accustomed to the fact of the disappearance of the money. She

had completely recovered from the hysteria caused by old Batchgrew's

attack, and was, indeed, in the supervening calm, very much ashamed of

it.
She meant to doze, having firmly declined the suggestion of Mrs. Tams

that she should go to bed at seven o'clock, and she was just dropping

the paper when a tap on the window startled her. She looked in alarm

at the window, where the position of one of the blinds proved the

correctness of Mrs. Maldon's secret theory that if Mrs. Maldon did

not keep a personal watch on the blinds they would never be drawn

properly. Eight inches of black pane showed, and behind that dark

transparency something vague and pale. She knew it must be the hand of

Louis Fores that had tapped, and she could feel her heart beating.

She flew on tiptoe to the front door, and cautiously opened it. At

the same moment Louis sprang from the narrow space between the street

railings and the bow window on to the steps. He raised his hat with

the utmost grace.
"I saw your head over the arm of the Chesterfield," he said in a

cheerful, natural low voice. "So I tapped on the glass. I thought if

I knocked at the door I might waken the old lady. How are things

to-night?"
In those few words he perfectly explained his manner of announcing

himself, endowing it with the highest propriety. Rachel's misgivings

were soothed in an instant. Her chief emotion was an ecstatic

pride—because he had come, because he could not keep away, because

she had known that he would come, that he must come. And in fact was

it not his duty to come? Quietly he came into the hall, quietly she

closed the door, and when they were shut up together in the parlour

they both spoke in hushed voices, lest the invalid should be

disturbed. And was not this, too, highly proper?
She gave him the news of the house and said that Mrs. Tams was taking

duty in the sick-room till four o'clock in the morning, and herself

thenceforward, but that the invalid gave no apparent cause for

apprehension.
"Old Batch been again?" asked Louis, with a complete absence of any

constraint.
She shook her head.
"You'll find that money yet—somewhere, when you're least expecting

it," said he, almost gaily.
"I'm sure we shall," she agreed with conviction.
"And how are you?" His tone became anxious and particular.

She blushed deeply, for the outbreak of which she had been guilty and

which he had witnessed, then smiled diffidently.
"Oh, I'm all right."
"You look as if you wanted some fresh air—if you'll excuse me saying

so."
"I haven't been out to-day, of course," she said.
"Don't you think a walk—just a breath—would do you good!"
Without allowing herself to reflect, she answered—
"Well, I ought to have gone out long ago to get some food for

to-morrow, as it's Sunday. Everything's been so neglected to-day. If

the doctor happened to order a cutlet or anything for Mrs. Maldon,

I don't know what I should do. Truly I ought to have thought of it

earlier."
She seemed to be blaming herself for neglectfulness, and thus the

enterprise of going out had the look of an act of duty. Her sensations

bewildered her.
"Perhaps I could walk down with you and carry parcels. It's a good

thing it's Saturday night, or the shops might have been closed."
She made no answer to this, but stood up, breathing quickly.
"I'll just speak to Mrs. Tams."
Creeping upstairs, she silently pushed open the door of Mrs. Maldon's

bedroom. The invalid was asleep. Mrs. Tams, her hands crossed in her

comfortable lap, and her mouth widely open, was also asleep. But Mrs.

Tams was used to waking with the ease of a dog. Rachel beckoned her to

the door. Without a sound the fat woman crossed the room.
"I'm just going out to buy a few things we want," said Rachel in her

ear, adding no word as to Louis Fores.
Mrs. Tams nodded.
Rachel went to her bedroom, turned up the gas, straightened her hair,

and put on her black hat, and her blue jacket trimmed with a nameless

fur, and picked up some gloves and her purse. Before descending she

gazed at herself for many seconds in the small, slanting glass. Coming

downstairs, she took the marketing reticule from its hook in the

kitchen passage. Then she went back to the parlour and stood in the

doorway, speechless, putting on her gloves rapidly.
"Ready?"
She nodded.
"Shall I?" Louis questioned, indicating the gas.
She nodded again, and, stretching to his full height, he managed

to turn the gas down without employing a footstool as Rachel was

compelled to do.
"Wait a moment," she whispered in the hall, when he had opened the

front door. These were the first words she had been able to utter. She

went to the kitchen for a latch-key. Inserting this latch-key in the

keyhole on the outside, and letting Louis pass in front of her, she

closed the front door with very careful precautions against noise, and

withdrew the key.
"I'll take charge of that if you like," said Louis, noticing that she

was hesitating where to bestow it.
She gave it up to him with a violent thrill. She was intensely happy

and intensely fearful. She was only going out to do some shopping;

but the door was shut behind her, and at her side was this magic,

mysterious being, and the nocturnal universe lay around. Only

twenty-four hours earlier she had shut the door behind her and gone

forth to find Louis. And now, having found him, he and she were going

forth together like close friends. So much had happened in twenty-four

hours that the previous night seemed to be months away.

II
Instead of turning down Friendly Street, they kept straight along the

lane till, becoming suddenly urban, it led them across tram-lines

and Turnhill Road, and so through a gulf or inlet of the market-place

behind the Shambles, the Police Office, and the Town Hall, into the

market-place itself, which in these latter years was recovering a

little of the commercial prestige snatched from it half a century

earlier by St. Luke's Square. Rats now marauded in the empty shops of

St. Luke's Square, while the market-place glittered with custom, and

the electric decoy of its façades lit up strangely the lower walls of

the black and monstrous Town Hall.
Innumerable organized activities were going forward at that moment in

the serried buildings of the endless confused streets that stretched

up hill and down dale from one end of the Five Towns to the

other—theatres, Empire music-halls, Hippodrome music-halls,

picture-palaces in dozens, concerts, singsongs, spiritualistic

propaganda, democratic propaganda, skating-rinks, Wild West

exhibitions, Dutch auctions, and the private séances in dubious

quarters of "psychologists," "clair-voyants," "scientific palmists,"

and other rascals who sold a foreknowledge of the future for

eighteenpence or even a shilling. Viewed under certain aspects, it

seemed indeed that the Five Towns, in the week-end desertion of its

sordid factories, was reaching out after the higher life, the subtler

life, the more elegant life of greater communities; but the little

crowds and the little shops of Bursley market-place were nevertheless

a proof that a tolerable number of people were still mainly interested

in the primitive elemental enterprise of keeping stomachs filled and

skins warm, and had no thought beyond it. In Bursley market-place the

week's labour was being translated into food and drink and clothing by

experts who could distinguish infallibly between elevenpence-halfpenny

and a shilling. Rachel was such an expert. She forced her thoughts

down to the familiar, sane, safe subject of shopping, though to-night

her errands were of the simplest description, requiring no brains. But

she could not hold her thoughts. A voice was continually whispering to

her—not Louis Fores' voice, but a voice within herself, that she had

never clearly heard before. Alternatively she scorned it and trembled

at it.
She stopped in front of the huge window of Wason's Provision Emporium.
"Is this the first house of call?" asked Louis airily, swinging the

reticule and his stick together.
"Well—" she hesitated. "Mrs. Tams told me they were selling Singapore

pineapple at sevenpence-halfpenny. Mas. Maldon fancies pineapple. I've

known her fancy a bit of pineapple when she wouldn't touch anything

else.... Yes, there it is!"
In fact, the whole of the upper half of Wason's window was yellow

with tins of preserved pineapple. And great tickets said: "Delicious

chunks, 7 1/2d. per large tin. Chunks, 6 1/2d. per large tin."
Customers in ones and twos kept entering and leaving the shop. Rachel

moved on towards the door, which was at the corner of the Cock yard,

and looked within. The long double counters were being assailed by

a surging multitude who fought for the attention of prestidigitatory

salesmen.
"Hm!" murmured Rachel. "That may be all very well for Mrs. Tams...."
A moment later she said—
"It's always like that with Wason's shops for the first week or two!"
And her faintly sarcastic tone of a shrewd housewife immediately set

Wason in his place—Wason with his two hundred and sixty-five shops,

and his racing-cars, and his visits to kings and princes. Wason had

emporia all over the kingdom, and in particular at Knype, Hanbridge,

and Longshaw. And now he had penetrated to Bursley, sleepiest of

the Five. His method was to storm a place by means of electricity,

full-page advertisements in news-papers, the power of his mere name,

and a leading line or so. At Bursley his leading line was apparently

"Singapore delicious chunks at 7-1/2d. per large tin." Rachel knew

Wason; she had known him at Knype. And she was well aware that his

speciality was second-rate. She despised him. She despised that

multitude of simpletons who, full of the ancient illusion that

somewhere something can regularly be had for nothing, imagined

that Wason's bacon and cheese were cheap because he sold preserved

pineapple at a penny less than anybody else in the town. And she

despised the roaring, vulgar success of advertising and electricity.

She had in her some tincture of the old nineteenth century, which

loved the decency of small, quiet things. And in the prim sanity of

her judgment upon Wason she forgot for a few instants that she was in

a dream, and that the streets and the whole town appeared strange and

troubling to her, and that she scarcely knew what she was doing, and

that the most seductive and enchanting of created men was at her side

and very content to be at her side. And also the voice within her was

hushed.
She said—
"I don't see the fun of having the clothes torn off my back to save a

penny. I think I shall go to Malkin's. I'll get some cocoa there, too.

Mrs. Tams simply lives for cocoa."
And Louis archly answered—
"I've always wondered what Mrs. Tams reminds me of. Now I know. She's

exactly like a cocoa-tin dented in the middle."
She laughed with pleasure, not because she considered the remark in

the least witty, but because it was so characteristic of Louis Fores.

She wished humbly that she could say things just like that, and with

caution she glanced up at him.
They went into Ted Malkin's sober shop, where there was a nice handful

of customers, in despite of Wason only five doors away. And no sooner

had Rachel got inside than she was in the dream again, and the voice

resumed its monotonous phrase, and she blushed. The swift change took

her by surprise and frightened her. She was not in Bursley, but in

some forbidden city without a name, pursuing some adventure at

once shameful and delicious. A distinct fear seized her. Her

self-consciousness was intense.
And there was young Ted Malkin in his starched white shirt-sleeves

and white apron and black waistcoat and tie, among his cheeses and

flitches, every one of which he had personally selected and judged,

weighing a piece of cheddar in his honourable copper-and-brass scales.

He was attending to two little girls. He nodded with calm benevolence

to Rachel and then to Louis Fores. It is true that he lifted his

eyebrows—a habit of his—at sight of Fores, but he did so in a quite

simple, friendly, and justifiable manner, with no insinuations.
"In one moment, Miss Fleckring," said he.
And as he rapidly tied up the parcel of cheese and snapped off the

stout string with a skilled jerk of the hand, he demanded calmly—
"How's Mrs. Maldon to-night?"
"Much better," said Rachel, "thank you."
And Louis Fores joined easily in—
"You may say, very much better."
"That's rare good news! Rare good news!" said Malkin. "I heard you had

an anxious night of it.... Go across and pay at the other counter, my

dears." Then he called out loudly—"One and seven, please."
The little girls tripped importantly away.
"Yes, indeed," Rachel agreed. The tale of the illness, then, was

spread over the town! She was glad, and her self-consciousness somehow

decreased. She now fully understood the wisdom of Mrs. Maldon in

refusing to let the police be informed of the disappearance of the

money. What a fever in the shops of Bursley—even in the quiet shop of

Ted Malkin—if the full story got abroad!
"And what is it to be to-night, Miss Fleckring? These aren't quite

your hours, are they? But I suppose you've been very upset."
"Oh," said Rachel, "I only want a large tin of Singapore Delicious

Chunks, please."
But if she had announced her intention of spending a thousand pounds

in Ted Malkin's shop she would not have better pleased him. He

beamed. He desired the whole shop to hear that order, for it was the

vindication of honest, modest trading—of his father's methods and his

own. His father, himself, and about a couple of other tradesmen had

steadily fought the fight of the market-place against St. Luke's

Square in the day of its glory, and more recently against the

powerfully magnetic large shops at Hanbridge, and they had not been

defeated. As for Ted Malkin, he was now beyond doubt the "best"

provision-dealer and grocer in the town, and had drawn ahead even of

"Holl's" (as it was still called), the one good historic shop left in

Luke's Square. The onslaught of Wason had alarmed him, though he

had pretended to ignore it. But he was delectably reassured by

this heavenly incident of the representative of one of his most

distinguished customers coming into the shop and deliberately choosing

to buy preserved pineapple from him at 8-1/2d. when it could be got

thirty yards away for 7 1/2d. Rachel read his thoughts plainly.

She knew well enough that she had done rather a fine thing, and her

demeanour showed it. Ted Malkin enveloped the tin in suitable paper.
"Sure there's nothing else?"
"Not at this counter."
He gave her the tin, smiled, and as he turned to the next waiting

customer, called out—
"Singapore Delicious, eight and a half pence."
It was rather a poor affair, that tin—a declension from the great

days of Mrs. Maldon's married life, when she spent freely, knowing

naught of her husband's income except that it was large and elastic.

In those days she would buy a real pineapple, entire, once every three

weeks or so, costing five, six, seven, or eight shillings—gorgeous

and spectacular fruit. Now she might have pineapple every day if she

chose, but it was not quite the same pineapple. She affected to like

it, she did like it, but the difference between the old pineapple and

the new was the saddening difference, for Mrs. Maldon's secret heart,

between the great days and the paltry, facile convenience of the

twentieth century.
It was to his aunt, who presided over the opposite side of the shop,

including the cash-desk, that Ted Malkin proclaimed in a loud voice

the amounts of purchases on his own side. Miss Malkin was a virgin of

fifty-eight years' standing, with definite and unchangeable ideas on

every subject on earth or in heaven except her own age. As Rachel,

followed by Louis Fores, crossed the shop, Miss Malkin looked at them

and closed her lips, and lowered her eyelids, and the upper part of

her body seemed to curve slightly, with the sinuosity of a serpent—a

strange, significant movement, sometimes ill described as "bridling."
The total effect was as though Miss Malkin had suddenly clicked the

shutters down on all the windows of her soul and was spying at Rachel

and Louis Fores through a tiny concealed orifice in the region of her

eye. It was nothing to Miss Malkin that Rachel on that night of all

nights had come in to buy Singapore Delicious Chunks at 8-1/2d. It

was nothing to her that Mrs. Maldon had had "an attack." Miss Malkin

merely saw Rachel and Fores gadding about the town together of a

Saturday night while Mrs. Maldon was ill in bed. And she regarded

Ted's benevolence as the benevolence of a simpleton. Between Miss

Malkin's taciturnity and the voice within her Rachel had a terrible

three minutes. She was "sneaped"; which fortunately made her red hair

angry, so that she could keep some of her dignity. Louis Fores seemed

to be quite unconscious that a fearful scene was enacting between Miss

Malkin and Rachel, and he blandly insisted on taking the pineapple-tin

and the cocoa-tin and slipping them into the reticule, as though he

had been shopping with Rachel all his life and there was a perfect

understanding between them. The moral effect was very bad. Rachel

blushed again.
When she emerged from the shop she had the illusion of being

breathless, and in the midst of a terrific adventure the end of which

none could foresee. She was furious against Miss Malkin and against

herself. Yet she indignantly justified herself. Was not Louis Fores

Mrs. Maiden's nephew, and were not he and she doing the best thing

they could together under the difficult circumstances of the old

lady's illness? If she was not to co-operate with the old lady's sole

relative in Bursley, with whom was she to co-operate? In vain such

justifications!... She murderously hated Miss Malkin. She said to

herself, without meaning it, that no power should induce her ever to

enter the shop again.
And she thought: "I can't possibly go into another shop to-night—I

can't possibly do it! And yet I must. Why am I such a silly baby?"
As they walked slowly along the pavement she was in the wild dream

anew, and Louis Fores was her only hope and reliance. She clung to

him, though not with her arm. She seemed to know him very intimately,

and still he was more enigmatic to her than ever he had been.
As for Louis, beneath his tranquil mien of a man of experience and

infinite tact, he was undergoing the most extraordinary and delightful

sensations, keener even than those which had thrilled him in Rachel's

kitchen on the previous evening. The social snob in him had somehow

suddenly expired, and he felt intensely the strange charm of going

shopping of a Saturday night with a young woman, and making a

little purchase here and a little purchase there, and thinking about

halfpennies. And in his fancy he built a small house to which he

and Rachel would shortly return, and all the brilliant diversions of

bachelordom seemed tame and tedious compared to the wondrous existence

of this small house.
"Now I have to go to Heath's the butcher's," said Rachel, determined

at all costs to be a woman and not a silly baby. After that plain

announcement her cowardice would have no chance to invent an excuse

for not going into another shop.
But she added—
"And that'll be all."
"I know Master Bob Heath. Known him a long time," said Louis Fores,

with amusement in his voice, as though to imply that he could relate

strange and titillating matters about Heath if he chose, and indeed

that he was a mine of secret lore concerning the citizens.
The fact was that he had travelled once to Woore races with the

talkative Heath, and that Heath had introduced him to his brother

Stanny Heath, a local book-maker of some reputation, from whom Louis

had won five pounds ten during the felicitous day. Ever afterwards Bob

Heath had effusively saluted Louis on every possible occasion, and had

indeed once stopped him in the street and said: "My brother treated

you all right, didn't he? Stanny's a true sport." And Louis had to

be effusive also. It would never do to be cold to a man from whose

brother you had won—and received—five pounds ten on a racecourse.
So that when Louis followed Rachel into Heath's shop at the top

of Duck Bank the fat and happy Heath gave him a greeting in which

astonishment and warm regard were mingled. The shop was empty of

customers, and also it contained little meat, for Heath's was not

exactly a Saturday-night trade. Bob Heath, clothed from head to foot

in slightly blood-stained white, stood behind one hacked counter, and

Mrs. Heath, similarly attired, and rather stouter, stood behind the

other; and each possessed a long steel which hung from an ample loose

girdle.
Heath, a man of forty, had a salute somewhat military in gesture,

though conceived in a softer, more accommodating spirit. He raised his

chubby hand to his forehead, but all the muscles of it were lax and

the fingers loosely curved; at the same time he drew back his left

foot and kicked up the heel a few inches. Louis amiably responded.

Rachel went direct to Mrs. Heath, a woman of forty-five. She had never

before seen Heath in the shop.
"Doing much with the gees lately, Mr. Fores?" Heath inquired in a

cheerful, discreet tone.
"Not me!"
"Well, I can't say I've had much luck myself, sir."
The conversation was begun in proper form. Through it Louis could hear

Rachel buying a cutlet, and then another cutlet, from Mrs. Heath, and

protesting that five-pence was a good price and all she desired to pay

even for the finest cutlet in the shop. And then Rachel asked about

sweetbreads. Heath's voice grew more and more confidential and at

length, after a brief pause, he whispered—
"Ye're not married, are ye, sir? Excuse the liberty."
It was a whisper, but one of those terrible, miscalculated whispers

that can be heard for miles around, like the call of the cuckoo.

Plainly Heath was not aware of the identity of Rachel Fleckring. And

in his world, which was by no means the world of his shop and his

wife, it was incredible that a man should run round shopping with a

woman on a Saturday night unless he was a husband on unescapable duty.
Louis shook his head.
Mrs. Heath called out in severe accents which were a reproof and a

warning: "Got a sweetbread, Robert? It's for Mrs. Maldon."
The clumsy fool understood that he had blundered.
He had no sweetbread—not even for Mrs. Maldon. The cutlets were

wrapped in newspaper, and Louis rather self-consciously opened the maw

of the reticule for them.
"No offence, I hope, sir," said Heath as the pair left the shop,

thus aggravating his blunder. Louis and Rachel crossed Duck Bank in

constrained silence. Rachel was scarlet. The new cinema next to the

new Congregational chapel blazed in front of them.
"Wouldn't care to look in here, I suppose, would you?" Louis

imperturbably suggested.
Rachel did not reply.
"Only for a quarter of an hour or so," said Louis.
Rachel did not venture to glance up at him. She was so agitated that

she could scarcely speak.
"I don't think so," she muttered.
"Why not?" he exquisitely pleaded. "It will do you good."
She raised her head and saw the expression of his face, so charming,

so provocative, so persuasive. The voice within her was insistent, but

she would not listen to it. Nobody had ever looked at her as Louis

was looking at her then. The streets, the town faded. She thought:

"Whatever happens, I cannot withstand that face." She was feverishly

happy, and at the same time ravaged by both pain and fear. She became

a fatalist. And she abandoned the pretence that she was not the slave

of that face. Her eyes grew candidly acquiescent, as if she were

murmuring to him, "I am defenceless against you."

III
It was not surprising that Rachel, who never in her life had beheld

at close quarters any of the phenomena of luxury, should blink her

ingenuous eyes at the blinding splendour of the antechambers of the

Imperial Cinema de Luxe. Eyes less ingenuous than hers had blinked

before that prodigious dazzlement. Even Louis, a man of vast

experience and sublime imperturbability, visiting the Imperial on its

opening night, had allowed the significant words to escape him, "Well,

I'm blest!"—proof enough of the triumph of the Imperial!
The Imperial had set out to be the most gorgeous cinema in the Five

Towns; and it simply was. Its advertisements read: "There is always

room at the top." There was. Over the ceiling of its foyer enormous

crimson peonies expanded like tropic blooms, and the heart of each

peony was a sixteen-candle-power electric lamp. No other two cinemas

in the Five Towns, it was reported, consumed together as much current

as the Imperial de Luxe; and nobody could deny that the degree of

excellence of a cinema is finally settled by its consumption of

electricity.
Rachel now understood better the symbolic meaning of the glare in

the sky caused at night by the determination of the Imperial to make

itself known. She had been brought up to believe that, gas being

dear, no opportunity should be lost of turning a jet down, and that

electricity was so dear as to be inconceivable in any house not

inhabited by crass spendthrift folly. She now saw electricity

scattered about as though it were as cheap as salt. She saw written in

electric fire across the inner entrance the beautiful sentiment, "Our

aim is to please YOU." The "you" had two lines of fire under it.

She saw, also, the polite nod of the official, dressed not less

glitteringly than an Admiral of the Fleet in full uniform, whose sole

duty in life was to welcome and reassure the visitor. All this in

Bursley, which even by Knype was deemed an out-of-the-world spot and

home of sordid decay! In Hanbridge she would have been less surprised

to discover such marvels, because the flaunting modernity of Hanbridge

was notorious. And her astonishment would have been milder had she had

been in the habit of going out at night. Like all those who never went

out at night, she had quite failed to keep pace with the advancing

stride of the Five Towns on the great road of civilization.
More impressive still than the extreme radiance about her was the

easy and superb gesture of Louis as, swinging the reticule containing

pineapple, cocoa, and cutlets, he slid his hand into his pocket

and drew therefrom a coin and smacked it on the wooden ledge of the

ticket-window—gesture of a man to whom money was naught provided

he got the best of everything. "Two!" he repeated, with slight

impatience, bending down so as to see the young woman in white who sat

in another world behind gilt bars. He was paying for Rachel! Exquisite

experience for the daughter and sister of Fleckrings! Experience

unique in her career! And it seemed so right and yet so wondrous,

that he should pay for her!... He picked up the change, and without

a glance at them dropped the coins into his pocket. It was a glorious

thing to be a man! But was it not even more glorious to be a girl

and the object of his princely care?... They passed a heavy draped

curtain, on which was a large card, "Tea-Room," and there seemed to be

celestial social possibilities behind that curtain, though indeed it

bore another and smaller card: "Closed after six o'clock"—the result

of excessive caution on the part of a kill-joy Town Council. A boy in

the likeness of a midshipman took halves of the curving tickets and

dropped them into a tin box, and then next Rachel was in a sudden

black darkness, studded here and there with minute glowing rubies that

revealed the legend: "Exit. Exit. Exit."
Row after row of dim, pale, intent faces became gradually visible,

stretching far back-into complete obscurity; thousands, tens

of thousands of faces, it seemed—for the Imperial de Luxe was

demonstrating that Saturday night its claim to be "the fashionable

rage of Bursley." Then mysterious laughter rippled in the gloom, and

loud guffaws shot up out of the rippling. Rachel saw nothing whatever

to originate this mirth until an attendant in black with a tiny

white apron loomed upon them out of the darkness, and, beckoning them

forward, bent down, and indicated two empty places at the end of a

row, and the great white scintillating screen of the cinema came into

view. Instead of being at the extremity it was at the beginning of the

auditorium. And as Rachel took her seat she saw on the screen—which

was scarcely a dozen feet away—a man kneeling at the end of a

canal-lock, and sucking up the water of the canal through a hose-pipe;

and this astoundingly thirsty man drank with such rapidity that the

water, with huge boats floating on it, subsided at the rate of about a

foot a second, and the drinker waxed enormously in girth. The laughter

grew uproarious. Rachel herself gave a quick, uncontrolled, joyous

laugh, and it was as if the laugh had been drawn out of her violently

unawares. Louis Fores also laughed very heartily.
"Cute idea, that!" he whispered.
When the film was cut off Rachel wanted to take back her laugh. She

felt a little ashamed of having laughed at anything so silly.
"How absurd!" she murmured, trying to be serious.
Nevertheless she was in bliss. She surrendered herself to the joy

of life, as to a new sensation. She was intoxicated, ravished,

bewildered, and quite careless. Perhaps for the first time in her

adult existence she lived without reserve or preoccupation completely

in and for the moment. Moreover the hearty laughter of Louis Fores

helped to restore her dignity. If the spectacle was good enough for

him, with all his knowledge of the world, to laugh at, she need not

blush for its effect on herself. And in another ten seconds, when the

swollen man, staggering along a wide thoroughfare, was run down by

an automobile and squashed flat, while streams of water inundated the

roadway, she burst again into free laughter, and then looked round at

Louis, who at the same instant looked round at her, and they exchanged

an intimate smiling glance. It seemed to Rachel that they were alone

and solitary in the crowded interior, and that they shared exactly the

same tastes and emotions and comprehended one another profoundly and

utterly; her confidence in him, at that instant, was absolute, and

enchanting to her. Half a minute later the emaciated man was in a

room and being ecstatically kissed by a most beautiful and sweetly

shameless girl in a striped shirtwaist; it was a very small room, and

the furniture was close upon the couple, giving the scene an air of

delightful privacy. And then the scene was blotted out and gay music

rose lilting from some unseen cave in front of the screen.
Rachel was rapturously happy. Gazing along the dim rows, she descried

many young couples, without recognizing anybody at all, and most

of these couples were absorbed in each other, and some of the girls

seemed so elegant and alluring in the dusk of the theatre, and some

of the men so fine in their manliness! And the ruby-studded gloom

protected them all, including Rachel and Louis, from the audience at

large.
The screen glowed again. And as it did so Louis gave a start.
"By Jove!" he said, "I've left my stick somewhere. It must have been

at Heath's. Yes, it was. I put it on the counter while I opened this

net thing. Don't you remember? You were taking some money out of your

purse." Louis had a very distinct vision of his Rachel's agreeably

gloved fingers primly unfastening the purse and choosing a shilling

from it.
"How annoying!" murmured Rachel feelingly.
"I wouldn't lose that stick for a five-pound note." (He had a

marvellous way of saying "five-pound note.") "Would you mind very much

if I just slip over and get it, before he shuts? It's only across the

road, you know."
There was something in the politeness of the phrase "mind very

much" that was irresistible to Rachel. It caused her to

imagine splendid drawing-rooms far beyond her modest level, and the

superlative deportment therein of the well-born.
"Not at all!" she replied, with her best affability. "But will they

let you come in again without paying?"
"Oh, I'll risk that," he whispered, smiling superiorly.
Then he went, leaving the reticule, and she was alone.
She rearranged the reticule on the seat by her side. The reticule

being already perfectly secure, there was no need for her to touch

it, but some nervous movement was necessary to her. Yet she was less

self-conscious than she had been with Louis at her elbow. She felt,

however, a very slight sense of peril—of the unreality of the plush

fauteuil on which she sat, and those rows of vaguely discerned faces

on her right; and the reality of distant phenomena such as Mrs. Maldon

in bed. Notwithstanding her strange and ecstatic experiences with

Louis Fores that night in the dark, romantic town, the problem of the

lost money remained, or ought to have remained, as disturbing as ever.

To ignore it was not to destroy it. She sat rather tight in her place,

increasing her primness, and trying to show by her carriage that she

was an adult in full control of all her wise faculties. She set her

lips to judge the film with the cold impartiality of middle age, but

they persisted in being the fresh, responsive, mobile lips of a young

girl. They were saying noiselessly: "He will be back in a moment.

And he will find me sitting here just as he left me. When I hear him

coming I shan't turn my head to look. It will be better not."
The film showed a forest with a wooden house in the middle of it. Out

of this house came a most adorable young woman, who leaped on to a

glossy horse and galloped at a terrific rate, plunging down ravines,

and then trotting fast over the crests of clearings. She came to a man

who was boiling a kettle over a camp-fire, and slipped lithely from

the horse, and the man, with a start of surprise, seized her pretty

waist and kissed her passionately, in the midst of the immense

forest whose every leaf was moving. And she returned his kiss without

restraint. For they were betrothed. And Rachel imagined the free

life of distant forests, where love was, and where slim girls rode

mettlesome horses more easily than the girls of the Five Towns

rode bicycles. She could not even ride a bicycle, had never had the

opportunity to learn. The vision of emotional pleasures that in

her narrow existence she had not dreamed of filled her with mild,

delightful sorrow. She could conceive nothing more heavenly than to

embrace one's true love in the recesses of a forest.... Then came

crouching Indians.... And then she heard Louis Fores behind her. She

had not meant to turn round, but when a hand was put heavily on her

shoulder she turned quickly, resenting the contact.
"I should like a word with ye, if ye can spare a minute, young miss,"

whispered a voice as heavy as the hand. It was old Thomas Batchgrew's

face and whiskers that she was looking up at in the gloom.
As if fascinated, she followed in terror those flaunting whiskers up

the slope of the narrow isle to the back of the auditorium. Thomas

Batchgrew seemed to be quite at home in the theatre; he wore no hat

and there was a pen behind his ear. Never would she have set foot

inside the Imperial de Luxe had she guessed that Thomas Batchgrew was

concerned in it. She thought she had heard once, somewhere, that he

had to do with cinemas in other parts of the country, but it would

not have occurred to her to connect him with a picture-palace so near

home. She was not alone in her ignorance of the councillor's share in

the Imperial. Practically nobody had heard of it until that night, for

Batchgrew had come into the new enterprise by the back door of a loan

to its promoters, who were richer in ideas than in capital; and now,

the harvest being ripe, he was arranging, by methods not unfamiliar to

capitalists, to reap where he had not sown.
Shame and fear overcame Rachel. The crystal dream was shivered

to dust. Awful apprehension, the expectancy of frightful events,

succeeded to it. She perceived that since the very moment of quitting

the house the dread of some disaster had been pursuing her; only she

had refused to see it—she had found oblivion from it in the new and

agitatingly sweet sensations which Louis Fores had procured for her.

But now the real was definitely sifted out from the illusory. And

nothing but her own daily existence, as she had always lived it, was

real. The rest was a snare. There were no forests, no passionate

love, no flying steeds, no splendid adorers—for her. She was Rachel

Fleckring and none else.
Councillor Batchgrew turned to the left, and through a small hole in

the painted wall Rachel saw a bright beam shooting out in the shape of

a cone—forests, and the unreal denizens of forests shimmering across

the entire auditorium to impinge on the screen! And she heard the

steady rattle of a revolving machine. Then Batchgrew beckoned her into

a very small, queerly shaped room furnished with a table and a chair

and a single electric lamp that hung by a cord from a rough hook in

the ceiling. A boy stood near the door holding three tin boxes one

above another in his arms, and keeping the top one in position with

his chin. These boxes were similar to that in which Louis' tickets had

been dropped.
"Did you want your boxes, sir?" asked the boy.
"Put 'em down," Thomas Batchgrew growled.
The boy deposited them in haste on the table and hurried out.
"How is Mrs. Maldon?" demanded Mr. Batchgrew with curtness, after he

had snorted and sniffed. He remained standing near to Rachel.
"Oh, she's very much better," said Rachel eagerly. "She was asleep

when I left."
"Have ye left her by herself?" Mr. Batchgrew continued his inquiry.

His voice was as offensive as thick dark glue.
"Of course not! Mrs. Tams is sitting up with her." Rachel meant her

tone to be a dignified reproof to Thomas Batchgrew for daring

to assume even the possibility of her having left Mrs. Maldon to

solitude. But she did not succeed, because she could not manage her

tone. She desired intensely to be the self-possessed, mature woman,

sure of her position and of her sagacity; but she could be nothing

save the absurd, guilty, stammering, blushing little girl, shifting

her feet and looking everywhere except boldly into Thomas Batchgrew's

horrid eyes.
"So it's Mrs. Tams as is sitting with her!"
Rachel could not help explaining—
"I had to come down town to do some shopping for Sunday. Somebody had

to come. Mr. Fores had called in to ask after Mrs. Maldon, and so he

walked down with me." Every word she said appeared intolerably foolish

to her as she uttered it.
"And then he brought ye in here!" Batchgrew grimly completed the tale.
"We came in here for ten minutes or so, as I'd finished my shopping

so quickly. Mr. Fores has just run across to the butcher's to get

something that was forgotten."
Mr. Batchgrew coughed loosely and loudly. And beyond the cough, beyond

the confines of the ugly little room which imprisoned her so close to

old Batchgrew and his grotesque whiskers, Rachel could hear the harsh,

quick laughter of the audience, and then faint music—far off.
"If young Fores was here," said Mr. Batchgrew brutally, "I should tell

him straight as he might do better than to go gallivanting about the

town until that there money's found."
He turned towards his boxes.
"I don't know what you mean, Mr. Batchgrew," said Rachel, tapping her

foot and trying to be very dignified.
"And I'll tell ye another thing, young miss," Batchgrew went on.

"Every minute as ye spend with young Fores ye'll regret. He's a bad

lot, and ye may as well know it first as last. Ye ought to thank me

for telling of ye, but ye won't."
"I really don't know what you mean, Mr. Batchgrew!" She could not

invent another phrase.
"Ye know what I mean right enough, young miss!... If ye only came in

for ten minutes yer time's up."
Rachel moved to leave.
"Hold on!" Batchgrew stopped her. There was a change in his voice.
"Look at me!" he commanded, but with the definite order was mingled

some trace of cajolery.
She obeyed, quivering, her cheeks the colour of a tomato. In spite of

all preoccupations, she distinctly noticed—and not without a curious

tremor—that his features had taken on a boyish look. In the almost

senile face she could see ambushed the face of the youth that Thomas

Batchgrew had been perhaps half a century before.
"Ye're a fine wench," said he, with a note of careless but genuine

admiration. "I'll not deny it. Don't ye go and throw yerself away.

Keep out o' mischief."
Forgetting all but the last phrase, Rachel marched out of the room,

unspeakably humiliated, wounded beyond any expression of her own. The

cowardly, odious brute! The horrible ancient! What right had he?...

What had she done that was wrong, that would not bear the fullest

inquiry. The shopping was an absolute necessity. She was obliged to

come out. Mrs. Maldon was better, and quietly sleeping. Mrs. Tarns was

the most faithful and capable old person that was ever born. Hence she

was justified in leaving the invalid. Louis Fores had offered to go

with her. How could she refuse the offer? What reason could there be

for refusing it? As for the cinema, who could object to the cinema?

Certainly not Thomas Batchgrew! There was no hurry. And was she not an

independent woman, earning her own living? Who on earth had the right

to dictate to her? She was not a slave. Even a servant had an evening

out once a week. She was sinless....
And yet while she was thus ardently defending herself she knew well

that she had sinned against the supreme social law—the law of "the

look of things." It was true that chance had worked against her. But

common sense would have rendered chance powerless by giving it no

opportunity to be malevolent. She was furious with Rachel Fleckring.

That Rachel Fleckring, of all mortal girls, should have exposed

herself to so dreadful, so unforgettable a humiliation was mortifying

in the very highest degree. Her lips trembled. She was about to burst

into a sob. But at this moment the rattle of the revolving machine

behind the hole ceased, the theatre blazed from end to end with sudden

light, the music resumed, and a number of variegated advertisements

were weakly thrown on the screen. She set herself doggedly to walk

back down the slope of the aisle, not daring to look ahead for Louis.

She felt that every eye was fixed on her with base curiosity.... When,

after the endless ordeal of the aisle, she reached her place, Louis

was not there. And though she was glad, she took offence at his

delay. Gathering up the reticule with a nervous sweep of the hand, she

departed from the theatre, her eyes full of tears. And amid all the

wild confusion in her brain one little thought flashed clear and was

gone: the wastefulness of paying for a whole night's entertainment and

then only getting ten minutes of it!

IV
She met Louis Fores high up Bycars Lane, about a hundred yards below

Mrs. Maldon's house. She saw some one come out of the gate of the

house, and heard the gate clang in the distance. For a moment

she could not surely identify the figure, but as soon as Louis,

approaching, and carrying his stick, grew unmistakable even in the

darkness, all her agitation, which had been subsiding under the

influence of physical exercise, rose again to its original fever.
"Ah!" said Louis, greeting her with a most deferential salute. "There

you are. I was really beginning to wonder. I opened the front door,

but there was no light and no sound, so I shut it again and came back.

What happened to you?"
His ingenuous and delightful face, so confident, good-natured, and

respectful, had exactly the same effect on her as before. At the sight

of it Thomas Batchgrew's vague accusation against Louis was dismissed

utterly as the rancorous malice of an evil old man. For the rest, she

had never given it any real credit, having an immense trust in her own

judgment. But she had no intention of letting Louis go free. As she

had been put in the wrong, so must he be put in the wrong. This

seemed to her only just. Besides, was he not wholly to blame? Also she

remembered with strange clearness the admiration in the mien of the

hated Batchgrew, and the memory gave her confidence.
She said, with an effort after chilly detachment—
"I couldn't wait in the cinema alone for ever."
He was perturbed.
"But I assure you," he said nicely, "I was as quick as ever I could

be. Heath had put my stick in his back parlour to keep it safe for me,

and it was quite a business finding it again. Why didn't you wait?...

I say, I hope you weren't vexed at my leaving you."
"Of course I wasn't vexed," she answered, with heat. "Didn't I tell

you I didn't mind? But if you want to know, old Batchgrew came along

while you were gone and insulted me."
"Insulted you? How? What was he doing there?"
"How should I know what he was doing there? Better ask him questions

like that! All I can tell you is that he came to me and called me into

a room at the back—and—and—told me I'd no business to be there, nor

you either, while Mrs. Maldon was ill in bed."
"Silly old fool! I hope you didn't take any notice of him."
"Yes, that's all very fine, that is! It's easy for you to talk like

that. But—but—well, I suppose there's nothing more to be said!" She

moved to one side; her anger was rising. She knew that it was rising.

She was determined that it should rise. She did not care. She rather

enjoyed the excitement. She smarted under her recent experience; she

was deeply miserable; and yet, at the same time, standing there close

to Louis in the rustling night, she was exultant as she certainly had

never been exultant before.
She walked forward grimly. Louis turned and followed her.
"I'm most frightfully sorry," he said.
She replied fiercely—
"It isn't as if I didn't wait. I waited in the porch I don't know how

long. Then of course I came home, as there was no sign of you."
"When I went back you weren't there; it must have been while you were

with old Batch; so I naturally didn't stay. I just came straight up

here. I was afraid you were vexed because I'd left you alone."
"Well, and if I was!" said Rachel, splendidly contradicting herself.

"It's not a very nice thing for a girl to be left alone like

that—and all on account of a stick!" There was a break in her

voice.
Arrived at the gate, she pushed it open.
"Good-night," she snapped. "Please don't come in."
And within the gate she deliberately stared at him with an unforgiving

gaze. The impartial lamp-post lighted the scene.
"Good-night," she repeated harshly. She was saying to herself: "He

really does take it in the most beautiful way. I could do anything I

liked with him."
"Good-night," said Louis, with strict punctilio.
When she got to the top of the steps she remembered that Louis had the

latch-key. He was gone. She gave a wet sob and impulsively ran down

the steps and opened the gate. Louis returned. She tried to speak and

could not.
"I beg your pardon," said Louis. "Of course you want the key."
He handed her the key with a gesture that disconcertingly melted the

rigour of all her limbs. She snatched at it, and plunged for the gate

just as the tears rolled down her cheeks in a shower. The noise of the

gate covered a fresh sob. She did not look back. Amid all her quite

real distress she was proud and happy—proud because she was old

enough and independent enough and audacious enough to quarrel with

her lover, and happy because she had suddenly discovered life. And the

soft darkness and the wind, and the faint sky reflections of distant

furnace fires, and the sense of the road winding upward, and the very

sense of the black mass of the house in front of her (dimly lighted at

the upper floor) all made part of her mysterious happiness.

CHAPTER VIII
END AND BEGINNING

I
"Mrs. Tams!" said Mrs. Maldon, in a low, alarmed, and urgent voice.
The gas was turned down in the bedroom, and Mrs. Maldon, looking from

her bed across the chamber, could only just distinguish the stout,

vague form of the charwoman asleep in an arm-chair. The light from

the street lamp was strong enough to throw faint shadows of the

window-frames on the blinds. The sleeper did not stir.
Mrs. Maldon summoned again, more loudly—
"Mrs. Tams!"
And Mrs. Tams, starting out of another world, replied with

deprecation—
"Hey, hey!" as if saying: "I am here. I am fully awake and observant.

Please remain calm."
Mrs. Maldon said agitatedly—
"I've just heard the front door open. I'm sure whoever it was was

trying not to make a noise. There! Can't you hear anything?"
"That I canna'!" said Mrs. Tams.
"No!" Mrs. Maldon protested, as Mrs. Tams approached the gas to raise

it. "Don't touch the gas. If anybody's got in let them think we're

asleep."
The mystery of the vanished money and the fear of assassins seemed

suddenly to oppress the very air of the room. Mrs. Maldon was leaning

on one elbow in her bed.
Mrs. Tams said to her in a whisper—
"I mun go see."
"Please don't!" Mrs. Maldon entreated.
"I mun go see," said Mrs. Tams.
She was afraid, but she conceived that she ought to examine the house,

and no fear could have stopped her from going forth into the zone of

danger.
The next moment she gave a short laugh, and said in her ordinary

tone—
"Bless us! I shall be forgetting the nose on my face next. It's Miss

Rachel coming in, of course."
"Miss Rachel coming in!" repeated Mrs. Maldon. "Has she been out? I

was not aware. She said nothing—"
"Her came up a bit since, and said her had to do some shopping."
"Shopping! At this time of night!" murmured Mrs. Maldon.
Said Mrs. Tams laconically—
"To-morrow's Sunday—and pray God ye'll fancy a bite o' summat tasty."
While the two old women, equalized in rank by the fact of Mrs.

Maldon's illness, by the sudden alarm, and by the darkness of the

room, were thus conversing, sounds came from the pavement through

the slightly open windows—voices, and the squeak of the gate roughly

pushed open.
"That's Miss Rachel now," said Mrs. Tams.
"Then who was it came in before?" Mrs. Maldon demanded.
There was the tread of rapid feet on the stone steps, and then the

gate squeaked again.
Mrs. Tams went to the window and pulled aside the blind.
"Aye!" she announced simply. "It's Miss Rachel and Mr. Fores."
Mrs. Maldon caught her breath.
"You didn't tell me she was out with Mr. Fores," said Mrs. Maldon,

stiffly but weakly.
"It's first I knew of it," Mrs. Tams replied, still spying over the

pavement. "He's given her th' key. There! He's gone."
Mrs. Maldon muttered—
"The key? What key?"
"Th' latch-key belike."
"I must speak to Miss Rachel," breathed Mrs. Maldon in a voice of

extreme and painful apprehension.
The front door closing sent a vibration through the bedroom. Mrs.

Tarns hesitated an instant, and then raised the gas. Mrs. Maldon lay

with shut eyes on her left side and gave no sign of consciousness.

Light footsteps could be heard on the stairs.
"I'll go see," said Mrs. Tams.
In the heart of the aged woman exanimate on the bed, and in the heart

of the aging woman whose stout, coarse arm was still raised to the

gas-tap, were the same sentiments of wonder, envy, and pity, aroused

by the enigmatic actions of a younger generation going its perilous,

instinctive ways to keep the race alive.
Mrs. Tarns lighted a benzolene hand-lamp at the gas, and silently left

the bedroom. She still somewhat feared an unlawful invader, but the

arrival of Rachel had reassured her. Preceded by the waving

little flame, she passed Rachel's door, which was closed, and went

downstairs. Every mysterious room on the ground floor was in order and

empty. No sign of an invasion. Through the window of the kitchen she

saw the fresh cutlets under a wire cover in the scullery; and on the

kitchen table were the tin of pineapple and the tin of cocoa, with the

reticule near by. All doors that ought to be fastened were fastened.

She remounted the stairs and blew out the lamp on the threshold of the

mistress's bedroom. And as she did so she could hear Rachel winding

up her alarm-clock in quick jerks, and the light shone bright like a

silver rod under Rachel's door.
"Her's gone reet to bed," said Mrs. Tams softly, by the bedside of

Mrs. Maldon. "Ye've no cause for to worrit yerself. I've looked over

th' house."
Mrs. Maldon was fast asleep.
Mrs. Tams lowered the gas and resumed her chair, and the street lamp

once more threw the shadows of the window-frames on the blinds.

II
The next day Mrs. Tams, who had been appointed to sleep in the spare

room, had to exist under the blight of Rachel's chill disapproval

because she had not slept in the spare room—nor in any bed at all.

The arrangement had been that Mrs. Tams should retire at 4 a.m.,

Rachel taking her place with Mrs. Maldon. Mrs. Tams had not retired at

4 a.m. because Rachel had not taken her place.
As a fact, Rachel had been wakened by a bang of the front door,

at 10.30 a.m. only. Her first glance at the alarm-clock on her

dressing-table was incredulous. And she refused absolutely to believe

that the hour was so late. Yet the alarm-clock was giving its usual

sturdy, noisy tick, and the sun was high. Then she refused to believe

that the alarm had gone off, and in order to remain firm in her belief

she refrained from any testing of the mechanism, which might—indeed,

would—have proved that the alarm had in fact gone off. It became

with her an article of dogma that on that particular morning, of all

mornings, the very reliable alarm-clock had failed in its duty. The

truth was that she had lain awake till nearly three o'clock, turning

from side to side and thinking bitterly upon the imperfections of

human nature, and had then fallen into a deep, invigorating sleep from

which perhaps half a dozen alarm-clocks might not have roused her.
She arose full of health and anger, and in a few minutes she was out

of the bedroom, for she had not fully undressed; like many women, when

there was watching to be done, she loved to keep her armour on and to

feel the exciting strain of the unusual in every movement. She fell

on Mrs. Tams as Mrs. Tams was coming upstairs after letting out the

doctor and refreshing herself with cocoa in the kitchen. A careless

observer might have thought from their respective attitudes that it

was Mrs. Tarns, and not Rachel, who had overslept herself. Rachel

divided the blame between the alarm-clock and Mrs. Tams for not

wakening her; indeed, she seemed to consider herself the victim of

a conspiracy between Mrs. Tams and the alarm-clock. She explicitly

blamed Mrs. Tams for allowing the doctor to come and go without her

knowledge. Even the doctor did not get off scot-free, for he ought to

have asked for Rachel and insisted on seeing her.
She examined Mrs. Tams about the invalid's health as a lawyer examines

a hostile witness. And when Mrs. Tams said that the invalid had slept,

and was sleeping, stertorously in an unaccountable manner, and hinted

that the doctor was not undisturbed by the new symptom and meant to

call again later on, Rachel's tight-lipped mien indicated that this

might not have occurred if only Mrs. Tams had fulfilled her obvious

duty of wakening Rachel. Though she was hungry, she scornfully

repulsed the suggestion of breakfast. Mrs. Tams, thoroughly accustomed

to such behaviour in the mighty, accepted it as she accepted the

weather. But if she had had to live through the night again—after

all, a quite tolerable night—she would still not have wakened Rachel

at 4 a.m.
Rachel softened as the day passed. She ate a good dinner at one

o'clock, with Mrs. Tams in the kitchen, one or the other mounting at

short intervals to see if Mrs. Maldon had stirred. Then she changed

into her second-best frock, in anticipation of the doctor's Sunday

afternoon visit, strictly commanded Mrs. Tams (but with relenting

kindness in her voice) to go and lie down, and established herself

neatly in the sick-room.
Though her breathing had become noiseless again, Mrs. Maldon still

slept. She had wakened only once since the previous night. She lay

calm and dignified in slumber—an old and devastated woman, with that

disconcerting resemblance to a corpse shown by all aged people

asleep, but yet with little sign of positive illness save the slight

distortion of her features caused by the original attack. Rachel sat

idle, prim, in vague reflection, at intervals smoothing her petticoat,

or giving a faint cough, or gazing at the mild blue September sky. She

might have been reading a book, but she was not by choice a reader.

She had the rare capacity of merely existing. Her thoughts flitted to

and fro, now resting on Mrs. Maldon with solemnity, now on Mrs. Tams

with amused benevolence, now on old Batchgrew with lofty disgust, and

now on Louis Fores with unquiet curiosity and delicious apprehension.
She gave a little shudder of fright and instantly controlled it—Mrs.

Maldon, instead of being asleep, was looking at her. She rose and went

to the bedside and stood over the sick woman, by the pillow, benignly,

asking with her eyes what desire of the sufferer's she might fulfil.

And Mrs. Maldon looked up at her with another benignity. And they both

smiled.
"You've slept very well," said Rachel softly.
Mrs. Maldon, continuing to smile, gave a scarcely perceptible

affirmative movement of the head.
"Will you have some of your Revalenta? I've only got to warm it, here.

Everything's ready."
"Nothing, thank you, dear," said Mrs. Maldon, in a firm,

matter-of-fact voice.
The doctor had left word that food was not to be forced on her.
"Do you feel better?"
Mrs. Maldon answered, in a peculiar tone—
"My dear, I shall never feel any better than I do now."
"Oh, you mustn't talk like that!" said Rachel in gay protest.
"I want to talk to you, Rachel," said Mrs. Maldon, once more

reassuringly matter-of-fact. "Sit down there."
Rachel obediently perched herself on the bed, and bent her head. And

her face, which was now much closer to Mrs. Maldon's, expressed

the gravity which Mrs. Maldon would wish, and also the affectionate

condescension of youth towards age, and of health towards infirmity.

And as almost unconsciously she exulted in her own youth, and

strength, delicate little poniards of tragic grief for Mrs. Maldon's

helpless and withered senility seemed to stab through that personal

pride. The shiny, veined right hand of the old woman emerged from

under the bedclothes and closed with hot, fragile grasp on Rachel's

hand.
Within the impeccable orderliness of the bedroom was silence;

and beyond was the vast Sunday afternoon silence of the district,

producing the sensation of surcease, re-creating the impressive

illusion of religion even out of the brutish irreligion that was

bewailed from pulpits to empty pews in all the temples of all the Five

Towns. Only the smoke waving slowly through the clean-washed sky from

a few high chimneys over miles of deserted manufactories made a link

between Saturday and Monday.
"I've something I want to say to you," said Mrs. Maldon, in that

deceptive matter-of-fact voice. "I wanted to tell you yesterday

afternoon, but I couldn't. And then again last night, but I went off

to sleep."
"Yes?" murmured Rachel, duped by Mrs. Maldon's manner into perfect

security. She was thinking: "What's the poor old thing got into her

head now? Is it something fresh about the money?"
"It's about yourself," said Mrs. Maldon.
Rachel exclaimed impulsively—
"What about me?"
She could feel a faint vibration in Mrs. Maldon's hand.
"I want you not to see so much of Louis."
Rachel was shocked and insulted. She straightened her spine and threw

back her head sharply. But she dared not by force withdraw her hand

from Mrs. Maldon's. Moreover, Mrs. Maldon's clasp tightened almost

convulsively.
"I suppose Mr. Batchgrew's been up here telling tales while I was

asleep," Rachel expostulated, hotly and her demeanour was at once

pouting, sulky, and righteously offended.
Mrs. Maldon was puzzled.
"This morning, do you mean, dear?" she asked.
Tears stood in Rachel's eyes. She could not speak, but she nodded her

head. And then another sentence burst from her full breast: "And you

told Mrs. Tams she wasn't to tell me Mr. Batchgrew'd called!"
"I've not seen or heard anything of Mr. Batchgrew," said Mrs. Maldon.

"But I did hear you and Louis talking outside last night."
The information startled Rachel.
"Well, and what if you did, Mrs. Maldon?" she defended herself. Her

foot tapped on the floor. She was obliged to defend herself, and

with care. Mrs. Maldon's tranquillity, self-control, immense age and

experience, superior deportment, extreme weakness, and the respect

which she inspired, compelled the girl to intrench warily, instead

of carrying off the scene in one stormy outburst of resentment as

theoretically she might have done.
Mrs. Maldon said, cajolingly, flatteringly—
"My dear, do be your sensible self and listen to me."
It then occurred to Rachel that during the last day or so (the period

seemed infinitely longer) she had been losing, not her common

sense, but her immediate command of that faculty, of which she was,

privately, very proud. And she braced her being, reaching up towards

her own conception of herself, towards the old invulnerable Rachel

Louisa Fleckring. At any cost she must keep her reputation for common

sense with Mrs. Maldon.
And so she set a watch on her gestures, and moderated her voice,

secretly yielding to the benevolence of the old lady, and said, in

the tone of a wise and kind woman of the world and an incarnation of

profound sagacity—
"What do I see of Mr. Fores, Mrs. Maldon? I see nothing of Mr. Fores,

or hardly. I'm your lady help, and he's your nephew—at least, he's

your great-nephew, and it's your house he comes to. I can't help being

in the house, can I? If you're thinking about last night, well, Mr.

Fores called to see how you were getting on, and I was just going out

to do some shopping. He walked down with me. I suppose I needn't tell

you I didn't ask him to walk down with me. He asked me. I couldn't

hardly say no, could I? And there were some parcels and he walked back

with me."
She felt so wise and so clever and the narrative seemed so entirely

natural, proper, and inevitable that she was tempted to continue—
"And supposing we did go into a cinematograph for a minute or

two—what then?"
But she had no courage for the confession. As a wise woman she

perceived the advisability of letting well alone. Moreover, she hated

confessions, remorse, and gnashing of teeth.
And Mrs. Maldon regarded her worldly and mature air, with its touch of

polite condescension, as both comic and tragic, and thought sadly

of all the girl would have to go through before the air of mature

worldliness which she was now affecting could become natural to her.
"My dear," said Mrs. Maldon, "I have perfect confidence in you." It

was not quite true, because Rachel's protest as to Mr. Batchgrew,

seeming to point to strange concealed incidents, had most certainly

impaired the perfection of Mrs. Maiden's confidence in Rachel.
Rachel considered that she ought to pursue her advantage, and in a

voice light and yet firm, good-natured and yet restive, she said—
"I really don't think anybody has the right to talk to me about Mr.

Fores.... No, truly I don't."
"You mustn't misunderstand me, Rachel," Mrs. Maldon replied, and her

other hand crept out, and stroked Rachel's captive hand. "I am only

saying to you what it is my duty to say to you—or to any other young

woman that comes to live in my house. You're a young woman, and Louis

is a young man. I'm making no complaint. But it's my duty to warn you

against my nephew."
"But, Mrs. Maldon, I didn't know either him or you a month ago!"
Mrs. Maldon, ignoring the interruption, proceeded quietly—
"My nephew is not to be trusted."
Her aged face slowly flushed as in that single brief sentence she

overthrew the grand principle of a lifetime. She who never spoke ill

of anybody had spoken ill of one of her own family.
"But—" Rachel stopped. She was frightened by the appearance of the

flush on those devastated yellow cheeks, and by a quiver in the feeble

voice and in the clasping hand. She could divine the ordeal which Mrs.

Maldon had set herself and through which she had passed. Mrs. Maldon

carried conviction, and in so doing she inspired awe. And on the

top of all Rachel felt profoundly and exquisitely flattered by the

immolation of Mrs. Maiden's pride.
"The money—it has something to do with that!" thought Rachel.
"My nephew is not to be trusted," said Mrs. Maldon again. "I know

all his good points. But the woman who married him would suffer

horribly—horribly!"
"I'm so sorry you've had to say this," said Rachel, very kindly. "But

I assure you that there's nothing at all, nothing whatever, between

Mr. Fores and me." And in that instant she genuinely believed that

there was not. She accepted Mrs. Maldon's estimate of Louis. And

further, and perhaps illogically, she had the feeling of having

escaped from a fatal danger. She expected Mrs. Maldon to agree eagerly

that there was nothing between herself and Louis, and to reiterate

her perfect confidence. But, instead, Mrs. Maldon, apparently treating

Rachel's assurance as negligible, continued with an added solemnity—
"I shall only live a little while longer—a very little while." The

contrast between this and her buoyant announcement on the previous

day that she was not going to die just yet was highly disturbing,

but Rachel could not protest or even speak. "A very little while!"

repeated Mrs. Maldon reflectively. "I've not known you long—as you

say—Rachel. But I've never seen a girl I liked more, if you don't

mind me telling you. I've never seen a girl I thought better of. And I

don't think I could die in peace if I thought Louis was going to

cause you any trouble after I'm gone. No, I couldn't die in peace if I

thought that."
And Rachel, intimately moved, thought: "She has saved me from

something dreadful!" (Without trying to realize precisely from what.)

"How splendid she is!"
And she cast out from her mind all the multitudinous images of Louis

Fores that were there. And, full of affection, and flattered pride and

gratitude and childlike admiration, she bent down and rewarded the old

woman who had so confided in her with a priceless girlish kiss. And

she had the sensation of beginning a new life.

III
And yet, a few moments later, when Mrs. Maldon faintly murmured, "Some

one at the front door," Rachel grew at once uneasy, and the new life

seemed an illusion—either too fine to be true or too leaden to be

desired; and she was swaying amid uncertainties. Perhaps Louis was at

the front door. He had not yet called; but surely he was bound to call

some time during the day! Of the dozen different Rachels in Rachel,

one adventurously hoped that he would come, and another feared that he

would come; one ruled him sharply out of the catalogue of right-minded

persons, and another was ready passionately to defend him.
"I think not," said Rachel.
"Yes, dear; I heard some one," Mrs. Maldon insisted.
Mrs. Maldon, long practised in reconstructing the life of the street

from trifling hints of sound heard in bed, was not mistaken. Rachel,

opening the door of the bedroom, caught the last tinkling of the

front-door bell below. On the other side of the front door somebody

was standing—Louis Fores, or another!
"It may be the doctor," she said brightly, as she left the bedroom.

The coward in her wanted it to be the doctor. But, descending the

stairs, she could see plainly through the glass that Louis himself was

at the front door. The Rachel that feared was instantly uppermost in

her. She was conscious of dread. From the breathless sinking within

her bosom the stairs might have been the deck of a steamer pitching in

a heavy sea.
She thought—
"Here is the Louis to whom I am indifferent. There is nothing between

us, really. But shall I have strength to open the door to him?"
She opened the door, with the feeling that the act was tremendous and

irrevocable.
The street, in the Sabbatic sunshine, was as calm as at midnight.

Louis Fores, stiff and constrained, stood strangely against the

background of it. The unusualness of his demeanour, which was plain to

the merest glance, increased Rachel's agitation. It appeared to Rachel

that the two of them faced each other like wary enemies. She tried to

examine his face in the light of Mrs. Maldon's warning, as though it

were the face of a stranger; but without much success.
"Is auntie well enough for me to see her?" asked Louis, without

greeting or preliminary of any sort. His voice was imperfectly under

control.
Rachel replied curtly—
"I dare say she is."
To herself she said—
"Of course if he's going to sulk about last night—well, he must sulk.

Really and truly he got much less than he deserved. He had no business

at all to have suggested me going to the cinematograph with him. The

longer he sulks the better I shall be pleased."
And in fact she was relieved at his sullenness. She tossed her proud

head, but with primness. And she fervently credited to the full Mrs.

Maldon's solemn insinuations against the disturber.
Louis hesitated a second, then stepped in. Rachel marched

processionally upstairs, and with the detachment of a footman

announced to Mrs. Maldon that Mr. Fores waited below. "Oh, please

bring him up," said Mrs. Maldon, with a mild and casual benevolence

that surprised the girl; for Rachel, in the righteous ferocity of

her years, vaguely thought that an adverse moral verdict ought to be

swiftly followed by something in the nature of annihilation.
"Will you please come up," she invited Louis, from the head of the

stairs, adding privately—"I can be as stiff as you can—and stiffer.

How mistaken I was in you!"
She preceded him into the bedroom, and then with ostentatious

formality left aunt and nephew together. Nobody should ever say any

more that she encouraged the attentions of Louis Fores.
"What is the matter, dear?" Mrs. Maldon inquired from her bed,

perceiving the signs of emotion on Louis' face.
"Has Mr. Batchgrew been here yet?" Louis demanded.
"No. Is he coming?"
"Yes, he's just been to my digs. Came in his car. Auntie, do you know

that he's accusing me of stealing your money—and—and—all sorts of

things! I don't want to hide anything from you. It's true I was with

Rachel at the cinematograph last night, but—"
Mrs. Maldon raised her enfeebled, shaking hand.
"Louis!" she entreated. His troubled, ingenuous face seemed to torture

her.
"I know it's a shame to bother you, auntie. But what was I to do? He's

coming up here. I only want to tell you I've not got your money. I've

not stolen it. I'm absolutely innocent—absolutely. And I'll swear it

on anything you like." His voice almost broke under the strain of its

own earnestness. His plaintive eyes invoked justice and protection.

Who could have doubted that he was sincere in this passionate, wistful

protestation of innocence?
"Louis!" Mrs. Maldon entreated again, committing herself to naught,

taking no side, but finding shelter beneath the enigmatic, appealing

repetition of his name. It was the final triumph of age over crude

youth. "Louis!"

IV
Rachel stood expectant and watchful in the kitchen. She was now filled

with dread. She wanted to go up and waken Mrs. Tams, but was too

proud. The thought had come into her mind: "His coming like this has

something to do with the money. Perhaps he wasn't sulking with me

after all. Perhaps ..." But what it was that she dreaded she could

not have defined. And then she caught the sound of an approaching

automobile. The car threw its shadow across the glazed front door,

which she commanded from the kitchen, and stopped. And the front-door

bell rang uncannily over her head. She opened the door to Councillor

Batchgrew, whose breathing was irregular and rapid.
"Has Louis Fores been here?" Batchgrew asked.
"He's upstairs now with Mrs. Maldon."
Without warning, Thomas Batchgrew strode into the house and straight

upstairs. His long whiskers sailed round the turn of the stairs and

disappeared. Rachel was somewhat discomfited, and very resentful.

But her dread was not thereby diminished. "They'll kill the old lady

between them if they don't take care," she thought.
The next instant Louis appeared at the head of the stairs. With

astounding celerity Rachel slipped into the parlour. She could not

bear to encounter him in the lobby—it was too narrow. She heard Louis

come down the stairs, saw him take his hat from the oak chest and

heard him open the front gate. In the lobby he had looked neither

to right nor left. "How do, Ernest!" she heard him greet the amateur

chauffeur-in-chief of the Batchgrew family. His footfalls on the

pavement died away into the general silence of the street. Overhead

she could hear old Batchgrew walking to and fro. Without reflection

she went upstairs and hovered near the door of Mrs. Maldon's bedroom.

She said to herself that she was not eavesdropping. She listened,

while pretending not to listen, but there was no sign of conversation

within the room. And then she very distinctly heard old Batchgrew

exclaim—
"And they go gallivanting off together to the cinema!"
Upon which ensued another silence.
Rachel flushed with shame, fury, and apprehension. She hated

Batchgrew, and Louis, and all gross masculine invaders.
The mysterious silence within the room persisted. And then old

Batchgrew violently opened the door and glared at Rachel. He showed no

surprise at seeing her there on the landing.
"Ye'd better keep an eye on missis," he said gruffly. "She's gone to

sleep seemingly."
And with no other word he departed.
Before the car had given its warning hoot Rachel was at Mrs. Maldon's

side. The old lady lay in all tranquillity on her left arm. She was

indeed asleep, or she was in a stupor, and the peculiar stertorous

noise of her breathing had recommenced.
Rachel's vague dread vanished as she gazed at the worn features, and

gave place to a new and definite fright.
"They have killed her!" she muttered.
And she ran into the next room and called Mrs. Tams.
"Who's below?" asked Mrs. Tarns, as, wide awake, she came out on to

the landing.
"Nobody," said Rachel. "They've gone."
But the doctor was below. Mr. Batchgrew had left the front door open.
"What a good thing!" cried Rachel.
In the bedroom Dr. Yardley, speaking with normal loudness, just as

though Mrs. Maldon had not been present, said to Rachel—
"I expected this this morning. There's nothing to be done. If you

try to give her food she'll only get it into the lung. It's very

improbable that she'll regain consciousness."
"But are you sure, doctor?" Rachel asked.
The doctor answered grimly—
"No, I'm not—I'm never sure. She may recover."
"She's been rather disturbed this afternoon."
The doctor lifted his shoulders.
"That's got nothing to do with it," said he. "As I told you, she's

had an embolus in one artery of the brain. It lessened at first for

a bit—they do sometimes—and now it's enlarging, that's all. Nothing

external could affect it either way."
"But how long—?" asked Rachel, recoiling.

V
Her chief sensation that evening was that she was alone, for Mrs.

Tams was not a companion, but a slave. She was alone with a grave and

strange responsibility, which she could not evade. Indeed, events had

occurred in such a manner as to make her responsibility seem

natural and inevitable, to give it the sanction of the most correct

convention. Between 4.30 and 6 in the afternoon four separate calls of

inquiry had been made at the house, thus demonstrating Mrs. Maldon's

status in the town. One lady had left a fine bunch of grapes. To all

these visitors Rachel had said the same things, namely, that Mrs.

Maldon had been better on the Saturday, but was worse; that the case

was very serious; that the doctor had been twice that day and was

coming again, that Councillor Batchgrew was fully informed and had

seen the patient; that Mr. Louis Fores, Mrs. Maldon's only near

relative in England, was constantly in and out; that she herself had

the assistance of Mrs. Tams, who was thoroughly capable, and that

while she was much obliged for offers of help, she could think of no

way of utilizing them.
So that when the door closed on the last of the callers, Rachel, who

a month earlier had never even seen Mrs. Maldon, was left in sole

rightful charge of the dying-bed. And there was no escape for her.

She could not telegraph—the day being Sunday. Moreover, except Thomas

Batchgrew, there was nobody to whom she might telegraph. And she did

not want Mr. Batchgrew. Though Mr. Batchgrew certainly had not guessed

the relapse, she felt no desire whatever to let him have news.

She hated his blundering intrusions; and in spite of the doctor's

statements she would insist to herself that he and Louis between them

had somehow brought about the change in Mrs. Maldon. Of course she

might fetch Louis. She did not know his exact address, but he could

be discovered. At any rate, Mrs. Tams might be sent for him. But she

could not bring herself to make any advance towards Louis.
At a little after six o'clock, when the rare chapel-goers had ceased

to pass, and the still rarer church-goers were beginning to respond

to distant bells, Mrs. Tams informed her that tea was ready for her in

the parlour, and she descended and took tea, utterly alone. Mrs. Tams

had lighted the fire, and had moved the table comfortably towards the

fire—act of astounding initiative and courage, in itself a dramatic

proof that Mrs. Maldon no longer reigned at Bycars. Tea finished,

Rachel returned to the sick-room, where there was nothing whatever

to do except watch the minutes recede. She thought of her father and

brother in America.
Then Mrs. Tams, who had been clearing away the tea-things, came into

the bedroom and said—
"Here's Mr. Fores, miss."
Rachel started.
"Mr. Fores! What does he want?" she asked querulously.
Mrs. Tams preserved her blandness.
"He asked for you, miss."
"Didn't he ask how Mrs. Maldon is?"
"No, miss."
"Well, I don't want to see him. You might run down and tell him what

the doctor said, Mrs. Tams." She tried to make her voice casually

persuasive.
"Shall I, miss?" said Miss Tams doubtfully, and turned to the door.
Rachel was again full of fear and resentment. Louis had committed the

infamy of luring her into the cinematograph. It was through him that

she had "got herself talked about." Mrs. Maldon's last words had

been a warning against him. He and Mr. Batchgrew had desecrated the

sick-room with their mysterious visitations. And now Louis was come

again. From what catastrophes had not Mrs. Maldon's warning saved her!
"Here! I'll go," said Rachel, in a sudden resolve.
"I'm glad on it," said Mrs. Tams simply.
In the parlour Louis stood in front of the fire. Although the blinds

were drawn, the gas had not been lighted; but the fire and the

powerful street lamp together sufficed to give clearness to every

object in the room. The table had been restored to its proper

situation. The gift of grapes ornamented the sideboard.
"Good-evening," said Rachel sullenly, as if pouting. She avoided

looking at Louis, and sat down on the Chesterfield.
Louis broke forth in a cascade of words—
"I say, I'm most awfully sorry. I hadn't the faintest notion this

afternoon she was any worse—not the faintest. Otherwise I shouldn't

have dreamt—I met the doctor just now in Moorthorne Road, and he told

me."
"What did he tell you?" asked Rachel, still with averted head, picking

at her frock.
"Well, he gave me to understand there's very little hope, and nothing

to be done. If I'd had the faintest notion—"
"You needn't worry about that," said Rachel. "Your coming made no

difference. The doctor said so." And she asked herself why she should

go out of her way to reassure Louis. It would serve him right to think

that his brusque visit, with Mr. Batchgrew's, was the origin of the

relapse.
"Is there any change?" Louis asked.
Rachel shook her head "No," she said. "We just have to sit and watch."
"Doctor's coming in again to-night, isn't he?"
Rachel nodded.
"It seems it's an embolus."
Rachel nodded once more. She had still no conception of what an

embolus was; but she naturally assumed that Louis could define an

embolus with exactitude.
"I say," said Louis, and his voice was suddenly charged with magical

qualities of persuasion, entreaty, and sincerity—"I say, you might

look at me."
She flushed, but she looked up at him. She might have sat straight and

remarked: "Mr. Fores, what do you mean by talking to me like that?"

But she raised her eyes and her crimson cheeks for one timid instant,

and dropped them. His voice had overcome her. With a single phrase,

with a mere inflection, he had changed the key of the interview. And

the glance at him had exposed her to the appeal of his face, more

powerful than ten thousand logical arguments and warnings. His

face proved that he was a sympathetic, wistful, worried

fellow-creature—and miraculously, uniquely handsome. His face in the

twilight was the most romantic face that Rachel had ever seen. His

gestures had a celestial charm.
He said—
"I know I ought to apologize for the way I came in this afternoon. I

do. But if you knew what cause I had ...! Would you believe that old

Batch had come to my place, and practically accused me of stealing the

old lady's money—stealing it!"
"Never!" Rachel murmured.
"Yes, he did. The fact is, he knew jolly well he'd no business to

have left it in the house that night, so he wanted to get out of it by

making me suffer. You know he's always been down on me. Well,

I came straight up here and I told auntie. Of course I couldn't make a

fuss, with her ill in bed. So I simply told her I hadn't got her money

and I hadn't stolen it, and I left it at that. I thought the less said

the better. But I had to say that much. I wonder what Julian would

have said if he'd been accused. I just wonder!" He repeated the word,

queerly evocative: "Julian!"
"What did Mrs. Maldon say?" Rachel asked.
"Well, she didn't say much. She believed me, naturally. And then old

Batch came. I wasn't going to have a regular scene with him up there,

so I left. I thought that was the only dignified thing to do. I wanted

to tell you, and I've told you. Don't you think it's a shame?"
Rachel answered passionately—
"I do."
She answered thus because she had a tremendous desire to answer thus.

To herself she said: "Do I?... Yes, I do." Louis' eyes drew sympathy

out of her. It seemed to her to be of the highest importance that

those appealing eyes should not appeal in vain.
"Item, he made a fearful fuss about you and me being at the cinema

last night."
"I should like to know what it's got to do with him!" said Rachel,

almost savagely. The word "item" puzzled her. Not understanding it,

she thought she had misheard.
"That's what I thought, too," said Louis, and added, very gravely:

"At the same time I'm really awfully sorry. Perhaps I oughtn't to

have asked you. It was my fault. But old Batch would make the worst of

anything."
Rachel replied with feverish conviction—
"Mr. Batchgrew ought to be ashamed. You weren't to blame, and I won't

hear of it!"
Louis started forward with a sudden movement of the left arm.
"You're magnificent," he said, with emotion.
Rachel trembled, and shut her eyes. She heard his voice again, closer

to her, repeating with even greater emotion: "You're magnificent."

Tears were in her eyes. Through them she looked at him. And his form

was so graceful, his face so nice, so exquisitely kind and lovable and

loving, that her admiration became intense, even to the point of

pain. She thought of Batchgrew, not with hate, but with pity. He was

a monster, but he could not help it. He alone was responsible for all

slanders against Louis. He alone had put Mrs. Maldon against Louis.

Louis was obviously the most innocent of beings. Mrs. Maiden's

warning, "The woman who married him would suffer horribly," was

manifestly absurd. "Suffer horribly"—what a stinging phrase, like a

needle broken in a wound! She felt tired and weak, above all tired of

loneliness.
His hand was on hers. She trembled anew. She was not Rachel, but

some new embodiment of surrender and acquiescence. And the change was

delicious, fearful.... She thought: "I could die for him." She forgot

that a few minutes before she had been steeling herself against him.

She wanted him to kiss her, and waited an eternity. And when he had

kissed her, and she was in a maze of rapture, a tiny idea shaped

itself clearly in her mind for an instant: "This is wrong. But I don't

care. He is mine"—and then melted like a cloud in a burning sky. And

a sense of the miraculousness of destiny overcame her. In two days had

happened enough for two years. It was staggering to think that only

two days earlier she had been dreaming of him as of a star. Could

so much, indeed, happen in two days? She imagined blissfully, in her

ignorance of human experience, that her case was without precedent.

Nay, her case appalled her in the rapidity of its development! And was

thereby the more thrilling! She thought again: "Yes, I could die

for him—and I would!" He was still the star, but—such was the

miracle—she clasped him.
They heard Mrs. Tams knocking at the door. Nothing would ever cure the

charwoman's habit of knocking before entering. Rachel arose from the

sofa as out of a bush of blossoms. And in the artless, honest glance

of her virginity and her simplicity, her eyes seemed to say to Mrs.

Tams: "Behold the phoenix among men! He is to be my husband." Her

pride in the strange, wondrous, incredible state of being affianced

was tremendous, to the tragic point.
"Can ye hear, begging yer pardon?" said Mrs. Tams, pointing through

the open door and upward. "Her's just begun to breathe o' that'n [like

that]."
The loud, stertorous sound of Mrs. Maldon unconsciously drawing the

final breaths of life filled the whole house. Louis and Rachel glanced

at each other, scared, shamed, even horrified, to discover that the

vast pendulum of the universe was still solemnly ticking through their

ecstasy.
"I'm coming," said Rachel.

CHAPTER IX
THE MARRIED WOMAN

I
Wonderful things happen. If anybody had foretold to Mrs. Tams that in

her fifty-eighth year she would accede to the honourable order of the

starched white cap, Mrs. Tams could not have credited the prophecy.

But there she stood, in the lobby of the house at Bycars, frocked

in black, with the strings of a plain but fine white apron stretched

round her stoutness, and the cap crowning her grey hair. It was Louis

who had insisted on the cap, which Rachel had thought unnecessary

and even snobbish, and which Mrs. Tams had nervously deprecated.

Not without pleasure, however, had both women yielded to his indeed

unanswerable argument: "You can't possibly have a servant opening the

door without a cap. It's unthinkable."
Thus in her latter years of grandmotherhood had Mrs. Tams cast off

the sackcloth of the charwoman and become a glorious domestic servant,

with a room of her own in the house, and no responsibilities beyond

the house, and no right to leave the house save once a week, when she

visited younger generations, who still took from her and gave nothing

back. She owed the advancement to Rachel, who, quite unused to

engaging servants, and alarmed by harrowing stories of the futility

of registry offices and advertisements, had seen in Mrs. Tams the

comfortable solution of a fearful problem. Louis would have preferred

a younger, slimmer, nattier, fluffier creature than Mrs. Tams, but was

ready to be convinced that such as he wanted lived only in his fancy.

Moreover, he liked Mrs. Tams, and would occasionally flatter her by a

smack on the shoulder.
So in the April dusk Mrs. Tams stood in the windy lobby, and was full

of vanity and the pride of life. She gazed forth in disdain at

the little crowd of inquisitive idlers and infants that remained

obstinately on the pavement hoping against hope that the afternoon's

marvellous series of social phenomena was not over. She scorned the

slatternly, stupid little crowd for its lack of manners. Yet she ought

to have known, and she did know as well as any one, that though in

Bursley itself people will pretend out of politeness that nothing

unusual is afoot when something unusual most obviously is

afoot, in the small suburbs of Bursley, such as Bycars, no human

or divine power can prevent the populace from loosing its starved

curiosity openly upon no matter what spectacle that may differ from

the ordinary. Alas! Mrs. Tams in the past had often behaved even as

the simple members of that crowd. Nevertheless, all ceremonies being

over, she shut the front door with haughtiness, feeling glad that she

was not as others are. And further, she was swollen and consequential

because, without counting persons named Batchgrew, two visitors had

come in a motor, and because at one supreme moment no less than two

motors (including a Batchgrew motor) had been waiting together at

the curb in front of her cleaned steps. Who could have foreseen this

arrant snobbishness in the excellent child of nature, Mrs. Tams?
A far worse example of spiritual iniquity sat lolling on the

Chesterfield in the parlour. Ignorance and simplicity and a menial

imitativeness might be an excuse for Mrs. Tams; but not for Rachel,

the mistress, the omniscient, the all-powerful, the giver of good,

who could make and unmake with a nod. Rachel sitting gorgeous on the

Chesterfield amid an enormous twilit welter and litter of disarranged

chairs and tables; empty teapots, cups, jugs, and glasses; dishes of

fragmentary remains of cake and chocolate; plates smeared with roseate

ham, sticky teaspoons, loaded ash-trays, and a large general crumby

mess—Rachel, the downright, the contemner of silly social prejudices

and all nonsense, was actually puffed up because she had a servant in

a cap and because automobiles had deposited elegant girls at her door

and whirled them off again. And she would have denied it and yet was

not ashamed.
The sole extenuation of Rachel's base worldliness was that during the

previous six months she had almost continuously had the sensations of

a person crossing Niagara on a tight-rope, and that now, on this very

day, she had leaped to firm ground and was accordingly exultant. After

Mrs. Maldon's death she had felt somehow guilty of disloyalty; she

passionately regretted having had no opportunity to assure the old

lady that her suspicions about Louis were wrong and cruel, and

to prove to her in some mysterious way the deep rightness of the

betrothal. She blushed only for the moment of her betrothal. She had

solemnly bound Louis to keep the betrothal secret until Christmas. She

had laid upon both of them a self-denying ordinance as to meeting.

The funeral over, she was without a home. She wished to find another

situation; Louis would not hear of it. She contemplated a visit to her

father and brother in America. In response to a letter, her brother

sent her the exact amount of the steerage fare, and, ready to accept

it, she was astounded at Louis' fury against her brother and at the

accent with which he had spit out the word "steerage." Her brother

and father had gone steerage. However, she gave way to Louis, chiefly

because she could not bear to leave him even for a couple of months.

She was lodging at Knype, at a total normal expense of ten shillings

a week. She possessed over fifty pounds—enough to keep her for six

months and to purchase a trousseau, and not one penny would she deign

to receive from her affianced.
The disclosure of Mrs. Maldon's will increased the delicacy of her

situation. Mrs. Maldon had left the whole of her property in equal

shares to Louis and Julian absolutely. There were others who by blood

had an equal claim upon her with these two, but the rest had been

mere names to her, and she had characteristically risen above the

conventionalism of heredity. Mr. Batchgrew, the executor, was able

to announce that in spite of losses the heirs would get over three

thousand five hundred pounds apiece. Hence it followed that Rachel

would be marrying for money as well as for position! She trembled

when the engagement was at length announced. And when Louis, after

consultation with Mr. Batchgrew, pointed out that it would be

advantageous not merely to the estate as a whole, but to himself and

to her, if he took over the house at Bycars and its contents at

a valuation and made it their married home, she at first declined

utterly. The scheme seemed sacrilegious to her. How could she dare to

be happy in that house where Mrs. Maldon had died, in that house which

was so intimately Mrs. Maldon's? But the manifold excellences of the

scheme, appealing strongly to her common sense, overcame her scruples.

The dead are dead; the living must live, and the living must not be

morbid; it would be absurd to turn into a pious monument every

house which death has emptied; Mrs. Maldon, had she known all the

circumstances, would have been only too pleased, etc., etc. The affair

was settled, and grew into public knowledge.
Rachel had to emerge upon the world as an engaged girl. Left to

herself she would have shunned all formalities; but Louis, bred up

in Barnes, knew what was due to society. Naught was omitted. Louis'

persuasiveness could not be withstood. Withal, he was so right. And

though Rachel in one part of her mind had a contempt for "fuss," in

another she liked it and was half ashamed of liking it. Further, her

common sense, of which she was still proud, told her that the delicacy

of her situation demanded "fuss," and would be much assuaged thereby.

And finally, the whole thing, being miraculous, romantic, and

incredible, had the quality of a dream through which she lived in a

dazed nonchalance. Could it be true that she had resided with Mrs.

Maldon only for a month? Could it be true that her courtship had

lasted only two days—or at most, three? Never, she thought, had a

sensible, quiet girl ridden such a whirlwind before in the entire

history of the world. Could Louis be as foolishly fond of her as

he seemed? Was she truly to be married? "I shan't have a single

wedding-present," she had said. Then wedding-presents began to come.

"Are we married?" she had said, when they were married and in the

conventional clothes in the conventional vehicle. After that she soon

did realize that the wondrous and the unutterable had happened to her

too. And she swung over to the other extreme: instead of doubting the

reality of her own experiences, she was convinced that her experiences

were more real than those of any other created girl, and hence she

felt a slight condescension towards all the rest. "I am a married

woman," she reflected at intervals, with intense momentary pride.

And her fits of confusion in public would end in recurrences of this

strange, proud feeling.
Then she had to face the return to Bursley, and, later, the At Home

which Louis propounded as a matter of course, and which she knew to be

inevitable. The house was her toy, and Mrs. Tams was her toy. But

the glee of playing with toys had been overshadowed for days by the

delicious dread of the At Home. "It will be the first caller that will

kill me," she had said. "But will anybody really come?" And the first

caller had called. And, finding herself still alive, she had become

radiant, and often during the afternoon had forgotten to be clumsy.

The success of the At Home was prodigious, startling. Now and then

when the room was full, and people without chairs perched on the end

of the Chesterfield, she had whispered to her secret heart in a tiny,

tiny voice: "These are my guests. They all treat me with special

deference. I am the hostess. I am Mrs. Fores." The Batchgrew

clan was well represented, no doubt by order from authority, Mrs.

Yardley came, in surprising stylishness. Visitors arrived from Knype.

Miss Malkin came and atoned for her historic glance in the shop. But

the dazzlers were sundry male friends of Louis, with Kensingtonian

accents, strange phrases, and assurance in the handling of teacups and

the choosing of cake.... One by one and two by two they had departed,

and at last Rachel, with a mind as it were breathless from rapid

flittings to and fro, was seated alone on the sofa.
She was richly dressed in a dark blue taffeta dress that gave

brilliance to her tawny hair. Perhaps she was over-richly dressed,

for, like many girls who as a rule are not very interested in clothes,

she was too interested in them at times, and inexperienced taste was

apt to mislead her into an unfitness. Also her figure was too stiff

and sturdy to favour elegance. But on this occasion the general

effect of her was notably picturesque, and her face and hair, and the

expression of her pose, atoned in their charm for the shortcomings

and the luxuriance of the frock. She was no more the Rachel that

Mrs. Maldon had known and that Louis had first kissed. Her glance had

altered, and her gestures. She would ask herself, could it be true

that she was a married woman? But her glance and gestures announced

it true at every instant. A new languor and a new confidence had

transformed the girl. Her body had been modified and her soul at

once chastened and fired. Fresh in her memory was endless matter for

meditation. And on the sofa, in a negligent attitude of repose,

with shameless eyes gazing far into the caverns of the fire, and an

unreadable faint smile on her face, she meditated. And she was the

most seductive, tantalizing, self-contradictory object for study in

the whole of Bursley. She had never been so interesting as in this

brief period, and she might never be so interesting again.
Mrs. Tams entered. With her voice Mrs. Tams said, "Shall I begin to

clear all these things away, mam?" But with her self-conscious

eyes Mrs. Tams said to the self-conscious eyes of Rachel, "What a

staggering world we live in, don't we?"

II
Rachel sprang from the Chesterfield, smoothed down her frock, shook

her hair, and then ran upstairs to the large front bedroom, where

Louis, to whom the house was just as much a toy as to Rachel, was

about to knock a nail into a wall. Out of breath, she stood close

to him very happily. The At Home was over. She was now definitely

received as a married woman in a town full of married women and girls

waiting to be married women. She had passed successfully through a

trying and exhausting experience; the nervous tension was slackened.

And therefore it might be expected that she would have a sense of

reaction, the vague melancholy which is produced when that which has

long been seen before is suddenly seen behind. But it was not so

in the smallest degree. Every moment of her existence equally was

thrilling and happy. One piquant joy was succeeded immediately by

another as piquant. To Rachel it was not in essence more exciting to

officiate at an At Home than to watch Louis drive a nail into a wall.
The man winked at her in the dusk; she winked back, and put her hand

intimately on his shoulder. She thought, "I am safe with him now in

the house." The feeling of solitude with him, of being barricaded

against the world and at the mercy of Louis alone, was exquisite to

her. Then Louis raised himself on his toes, and raised his left arm

with the nail as high as he could, and stuck the point of the nail

against a pencil-mark on the wall. Then he raised the right hand with

the hammer; but the mark was just too high to be efficiently reached

by both hands simultaneously. Louis might have stood on a chair. This

simple device, however, was too simple for them.
Rachel said—
"Shall I stand on a chair and hold the nail for you?" Louis murmured—
"Brainy little thing! Never at a loss!"
She skipped on to a chair and held the nail. Towering thus above him,

she looked down on her husband and thought: "This man is mine alone,

and he is all mine." And in Rachel's fancy the thought itself seemed

to caress Louis from head to foot.
"Supposing I catch you one?" said Louis, as he prepared to strike.
"I don't care," said Rachel.
And the fact was that really she would have liked him to hit her

finger instead of the nail—not too hard, but still smartly. She would

have taken pleasure in the pain: such was the perversity of the young

wife. But Louis hit the nail infallibly every time.
He took up a picture which had been lying against the wall in a dark

corner, and thrust the twisting wire of it over the nail.
Rachel, when in the deepening darkness she had peered into the frame,

exclaimed, pouting—
"Oh, darling, you aren't going to hang that here, are you? It's so

old-fashioned. You said it was old-fashioned yourself. I did want that

thing that came this morning to be put somewhere here. Why can't

you stick this in the spare room?... Unless, of course, you

prefer...." She was being deferential to the art-expert in him,

as well as to the husband.
"Not in the least!" said Louis, acquiescent, and unhooked the picture.
Taste changes. The rejected of Rachel was a water-colour by the late

Athelstan Maldon, adored by Mrs. Maldon. Already it had been degraded

from the parlour to the bedroom, and now it was to be pushed away

like a shame into obscurity. It was a view of the celebrated Vale of

Llangollen, finicking, tight, and hard in manner, but with a certain

sentiment and modest skill. The way in which the initials "A.M."

had been hidden amid the foreground foliage in the left-hand corner

disclosed enough of the painter's quiet and proud temperament to

show that he "took after" his mother. Yet a few more years, and the

careless observer would miss those initials altogether and would

be contemptuously inquiring, "Who did this old daub, I wonder?" And

nobody would know who did the old daub, or that the old daub for

thirty years had been an altar for undying affection, and also a

distinguished specimen—admired by a whole generation of townsfolk—of

the art of water-colour.
And the fate of Athelstan's sketch was symptomatic. Mrs. Maiden's

house had been considered perfect, up to the time of her death. Rachel

had at first been even intimidated by it; Louis had sincerely

praised it. And indeed its perfection was an axiom of drawing-room

conversation. But as soon as Louis and Rachel began to look on the

house with the eye of inhabitants, the axiom fell to a dogma, and the

dogma was exploded. The dreadful truth came out that Mrs. Maldon had

shown a strange indifference to certain aspects of convenience, and

that, in short, she must have been a peculiar old lady with ideas

of her own. Louis proved unanswerably that in the hitherto faultless

parlour the furniture was ill arranged, and suddenly the sideboard and

the Chesterfield had changed places, and all concerned had marvelled

that Mrs. Maldon had for so long kept the Chesterfield where so

obviously the sideboard ought to have been, and the sideboard where so

obviously the Chesterfield ought to have been.
And still graver matters had come to light. The house had an attic

floor, which was unused and the scene of no activity except spring

cleaning. A previous owner, infected by the virus of modernity, had

put a bath into one of the attics. Now Mrs. Maldon, as experiments

disclosed, had actually had the water cut off from the bath. Eyebrows

were lifted at the revelation of this caprice. The restoration of

the supply of water and the installing of a geyser were the only

expenditures which thrifty Rachel had sanctioned in the way of

rejuvenating the house. Rachel had decided that the house must, at any

rate for the present, be "made to do." That such a decision should be

necessary astonished Rachel; and Mrs. Maldon would have been more

than astonished to learn that the lady help, by fortitude and

determination, was making her perfect house "do." As regards the

household inventory, Rachel had been obliged to admit exceptions to

her rule of endurance. Perhaps her main reason for agreeing to live in

the house had been that there would be no linen to buy. But truly

Mrs. Maldon's notion of what constituted a sufficiency of—for

example—towels, was quite too inadequate. Louis protested that he

could comfortably use all Mrs. Maldon's towels in half a day. More

towels had to be obtained. There were other shortages, but some of

them were set right by means of veiled indications to prospective

givers of gifts.
"You mean that 'Garden of the Hesperides' affair for up here, do you?"

said Louis.
Rachel gazed round the bedchamber. A memory of what it had been shot

painfully through her mind. For the room was profoundly changed

in character. Two narrow bedsteads given by Thomas Batchgrew, and

described by Mrs. Tarns, in a moment of daring, as "flighty," had

taken the place of Mrs. Maldon's bedstead, which was now in the spare

room, the spare-room bedstead having been allotted to Mrs. Tams,

and Rachel's old bedstead sold. Bright crocheted and embroidered

wedding-presents enlivened the pale tones of the room. The wardrobe,

washstand, dressing-table, chairs, carpet, and ottoman remained.

But there were razors on the washstand and boot-trees under it; the

wardrobe had been emptied, and filled on strange principles with

strange raiment; and the Maldon family Bible, instead of being on the

ottoman, was in the ottoman—so as to be out of the dust.
"Perhaps we may as well keep that here, after all," said Rachel,

indicating Athelsan's water-colour. Her voice was soft. She remembered

that the name of Mrs. Maldon, only a little while since a major

notability of Bursley and the very mirror of virtuous renown, had

been mentioned but once, and even then apologetically, during the

afternoon.
Louis asked, sharply—
"Why, if you don't care for it? I don't."
"Well—" said Rachel. "As you like, then, dearest."
Louis walked out of the room with the water-colour, and in a moment

returned with a photogravure of Lord Leighton's "The Garden of the

Hesperides," in a coquettish gold frame—a gift newly arrived from

Louis' connections in the United States. The marmoreal and academic

work seemed wonderfully warm and original in that room at Bycars.

Rachel really admired it, and admired herself for admiring it. But

when Louis had hung it and flicked it into exact perpendicularity, and

they had both exclaimed upon its brilliant effect even in the dusk,

Rachel saw it also with the eyes of Mrs. Maldon, and wondered what

Mrs. Maldon would have thought of it opposite her bed, and knew what

Mrs. Maldon would have thought of it.
And then, the job being done and the progress of civilization assured,

Louis murmured in a new appealing voice—
"I say, Louise!"
"Louise" was perhaps his most happy invention, and the best proof

that Louis was Louis. Upon hearing that her full Christian names

were Rachel Louisa, he had instantly said—"I shall call you Louise."

Rachel was ravished, Louisa is a vulgar name—at least it is vulgar

in the Five Towns, where every second general servant bears it. But

Louise was full of romance, distinction, and beauty. And it was the

perfect complement to Louis. Louis and Louise—ideal coincidence!

"But nobody except me is to call you Louise," he had added. And thus

completed her bliss.
"What?" she encouraged him amorously.
"Suppose we go to Llandudno on Saturday for the week-end?"
His tone was gay, gentle, innocent, persuasive. Yet the words stabbed

her and her head swam.
"But why?" she asked, controlling her utterance.
"Oh, well! Be rather a lark, wouldn't it?" It was when he talked in

this strain that the inconvenient voice of sagacity within her would

question for one agonizing instant whether she was more secure as the

proud, splendid wife of Louis Fores than she had been as a mere lady

help. And the same insistent voice would repeat the warnings which she

had had from Mrs. Maldon and from Thomas Batchgrew, and would remind

her of what she herself had said to herself when Louis first kissed

her—"This is wrong. But I don't care. He is mine."
Upon hearing of his inheritance from Mrs. Maldon, Louis was for

throwing up immediately his situation at Horrocleave's. Rachel had

dissuaded him from such irresponsible madness. She had prevented him

from running into a hundred expenses during their engagement and in

connection with the house. And he had in the end enthusiastically

praised her common sense. But that very morning at the midday meal he

had surprised her by announcing that on account of the reception he

should not go to the works at all in the afternoon, though he had

omitted to warn Horrocleave. Ultimately she had managed, by guile, to

dispatch him to the works for two hours. And now in the evening he

was alarming her afresh. Why go to Llandudno? What point was there in

rushing off to Llandudno, and scattering in three days more money than

they could save in three weeks? He frightened her ingrained prudence,

and her alarm was only increased by his obvious failure to realize the

terrible defect in himself. (For to her it was terrible.) The joyous

scheme of an excursion to Llandudno had suddenly crossed his mind,

exciting the appetite for pleasure. Hence the appetite must be

immediately indulged!... Rachel had been brought up otherwise. And as

a direct result of Louis' irresponsible suggestion she had a vision of

the house with county-court bailiffs lodged in the kitchen.... She had

only to say—"Yes, let's go," and they would be off on the absurd and

wicked expedition.
"I'd really rather not," she said, smiling, but serious.
"All serene. But, anyhow, next week's Easter, and we shall have to go

somewhere then, you know."
She put her hands on his shoulders and looked close at him, knowing

that she must use her power and that the heavy dusk would help her.
"Why?" she asked again. "I'd much sooner stay here at Easter. Truly I

would!... With you!"
The episode ended with an embrace. She had won.
"Very well! Very well!" said Louis. "Easter in the coal-cellar if you

like. I'm on for anything."
"But don't you see, dearest?" she said.
And he imitated her emphasis, full of teasing good humour—
"Yes, I see, dearest."
She breathed relief, and asked—
"Are you going to give me my bicycle lesson?"

III
Louis had borrowed a bicycle for Rachel to ruin while learning to

ride. He said that a friend had lent it to him—a man in Hanbridge

whose mother had given up riding on account of stoutness—but who

exactly this friend was Rachel knew not, Louis' information being

characteristically sketchy and incomplete; and with his air of candour

and good humour he had a strange way of warding off questions; so that

already Rachel had grown used to a phrase which she would utter only

in her mind, "I don't like to ask him—"
It pleased Louis to ride this bicycle out of the back yard, down

the sloping entry, and then steer it through another narrow gateway,

across the pavement, and let it solemnly bump, first with the front

wheel and then with the back wheel, from the pavement into the road.

During this feat he stood on the pedals. He turned the machine up

Bycars Lane, and steadily climbed the steep at Rachel's walking pace.

And Rachel, hurrying by his side, watched in the obscurity the play of

his ankles as he put into practice the principles of pedalling which

he had preached. He was a graceful rider; every movement was natural

and elegant. Rachel considered him to be the most graceful cyclist

that ever was. She was fascinated by the revolutions of his feet.
She felt ecstatically happy. The episode of his caprice for the

seaside was absolutely forgotten; after all, she asked for nothing

more than possession of him, and she had that, though indeed it seemed

too marvellous to be true. The bicycle lesson was her hour of magic;

and more so on this night than on previous nights.
"I must change my dress," she had said. "I can't go in this one."
"Quick, then!"
His impatience could not wait. He had helped her. He undid hooks, and

fastened others.... The rich blue frock lay across the bed and looked

lovely on the ivory-coloured counterpane. It seemed indeed to be a

part of that in her which was Louise. Then she was in a short skirt

which she had devised herself, and he was pushing her out of the room,

his hand on her back. And she had feigned reluctance, resisting his

pressure, while laughing with gleeful eagerness to be gone. No delay

had been allowed. As they passed through the kitchen, not one instant

for parley with Mrs. Tams as to the domestic organization of the

evening! He was still pushing her.... Thus she had had to confide her

precious house and its innumerable treasures to Mrs. Tams. And in this

surrender to Louis' whim there was a fearful joy.
When Louis turned at last into Park Road, and stepped from between the

wheels, she exclaimed, a little breathless from quick walking level

with him up the hill—
"I can't bear to see you ride so well. Oh!" She crunched her teeth

with a loving, cruel gesture. "I should like to hurt you frightfully!"
"What for?"
"Because I shall never, never be able to ride as well as you do!"
He winked.
"Here! Take hold."
"I'm not ready! I'm not ready!" she cried.
But he loosed the machine, and she was obliged to seize it as it fell.

That was his teasing.
Park Road had been the scene of the lesson for three nights. It was

level, and it was unfrequented. "And the doctor's handy in case

you break your neck," Louis had said. Dr. Yardley's red lamp shone

amicably among yellow lights, and its ray with theirs was lost in the

mysterious obscurities of the closed park. Not only was it socially

advisable for Rachel to study the perverse nature of the bicycle at

night—for not to know how to ride the bicycle was as shameful as not

to know how to read and write—but she preferred the night for the

romantic feeling of being alone with Louis, in the dark and above the

glow of the town. She loved the sharp night wind on her cheek, and

the faint clandestine rustling of the low evergreens within the park

palisade, and the invisible and almost tangible soft sky, revealed

round the horizon by gleams of fire. She had longed to ride the

bicycle as some girls long to follow the hunt or to steer an

automobile or a yacht. And now her ambition was being attained amid

all circumstances of bliss.
And yet she would shrink from beginning the lesson.
"The lamp! You've forgotten to light the lamp!" she said.
"Get on," said he.
"But suppose a policeman comes?"
"Suppose you get on and start! Do you think I don't know you?

Policemen are my affair. Besides, all nice policemen are in bed....

Don't be afraid. It isn't alive. I've got hold of the thing. Sit well

down. No! There are only two pedals. You seem to think there are about

nineteen. Right! No, no, no! Don't—do not—cling to those

blooming handle-bars as if you were in a storm at sea. Be a nice

little cat in front of the fire—all your muscles loose. Now! Are you

ready?"
"Yes," she murmured, with teeth set and dilated eyes staring ahead at

the hideous dangers of Park Road.
He impelled. The pedals went round. The machine slid terribly forward.
And in a moment Louis said, mischievously—
"I told you you'd have to go alone to-night. There you are!"
His footsteps ceased.
"Louis!" she cried, sharply and yet sadly upbraiding his unspeakable

treason. Her fingers gripped convulsively the handle-bars. She was

moving alone. It was inconceivably awful and delightful. She was on

the back of a wild pony in the forest. The miracle of equilibrium was

being accomplished. The impossible was done, and at the first attempt.

She thought very clearly how wondrous was life, and how perfectly

happy fate had made her. And then she was lying in a tangle amid

dozens of complex wheels, chains, and bars.
"Hurt?" shouted Louis, as he ran up.
She laughed and said "No," and sat up stiffly, full of secret dolours.

Yet he knew and she knew that the accidents of the previous two nights

had covered her limbs with blue discolorations, and that the latest

fall was more severe than any previous one. Her courage enchanted

Louis and filled him with a sense of security. She was not graceful in

these exercises. Her ankles were thick and clumsy. Not merely had she

no natural aptitude for physical feats—apparently she was not lissom,

nor elegant in motion. But what courage! What calm, bright endurance!

What stoicism! Most girls would have reproached him for betraying them

to destruction, would have pouted, complained, demanded petting and

apologies. But not she! She was like a man. And when he helped her

to pick herself up he noticed that after all she was both lissom and

agile, and exquisitely, disturbingly girlish in her short dusty skirt;

and that she did trust him and depend on him. And he realized that he

was safe for life with her. She was created for him.
Work was resumed.
"Now don't let go of me till I tell you," she enjoined lightly.
"I won't," he answered. And it seemed to him that his loyalty to her

expanded and filled all his soul.
Later, as she approached the other end of Park Road, near Moorthorne

Road, a tram-car hurled itself suddenly down Moorthorne Road and

overthrew her. It is true that the tram-car was never less than twenty

yards away from her. But even at twenty yards it could overthrow.

Rachel sat dazed in the road, and her voice was uncertain as she

told Louis to examine the bicycle. One of the pedals was bent, and

prevented the back wheel from making a complete revolution.
"It's nothing," said Louis. "I'll have it right in the morning."
"Who's that?" Rachel, who had risen, gasping, turned to him excitedly

as he was bending over the bicycle. Conscious that somebody had been

standing at the corner of the street, he glanced up. A figure was

moving quickly down Moorthorne Road in the direction of the station.
"I dun'no," said he.
"It's not Julian, is it?"
In a peculiar tone Louis replied—
"Looks like him, doesn't it?" And then impulsively he yelled

"Hi!"
The figure kept on its way.
"Seeing that the inimitable Julian's still in South Africa, it can't

very well be him. And, anyhow, I'm not going to run after him."
"No, of course it can't," Rachel assented.
Presently the returning procession was re-formed. Louis pushed the

bicycle on its front wheel, and Rachel tried to help him to support

the weight of the suspended part. He had attempted in vain to take the

pedal off the crank.
"It's perhaps a good thing you fell just then," said Louis. "Because

old Batch is coming in to-night, and we'd better not be late."
"But you never told me!"
"Didn't I? I forgot," he said blandly.
"Oh, Louis!... He's not coming for supper, I hope?"
"My child, if there's a chance of a free meal, old Batch will be on

the spot."
The unaccustomed housewife foretold her approaching shame, and

proclaimed Louis to be the author of it. She began to quicken her

steps.
"You certainly ought to have let me know sooner, dearest," she said

seriously. "You really are terrible."
Hard knocks had not hurt her. But she was hurt now. And Louis'

smile was very constrained. Her grave manner of saying "dearest" had

disquieted him.

CHAPTER X
THE CHASM

I
It is true that Rachel held Councillor Thomas Batchgrew in hatred,

that she had never pardoned him for the insult which he had put upon

her in the Imperial Cinema de Luxe; and that, indeed, she could never

pardon him for simply being Thomas Batchgrew. Nevertheless, there was

that evening in her heart a little softening towards him. The fact

was that the councillor had been flattering her. She would have denied

warmly that she was susceptible to flattery; even if authoritatively

informed that no human being whatever is unsusceptible to flattery,

she would still have protested that she at any rate was, for, like

numerous young and inexperienced women, she had persuaded herself that

she was the one exception to various otherwise universal rules.
It remained that Thomas Batchgrew had been flattering her. On arrival

he had greeted her with that tinge of deference which from an old man

never fails to thrill a girl. Rachel's pride as a young married woman

was tigerishly alert and hungry that evening. Thomas Batchgrew, little

by little, tamed and fed it very judiciously at intervals, until at

length it seemed to purr content around him like a cat. The phenomenon

was remarkable, and the more so in that Rachel was convinced that,

whereas she was as critical and inimical as ever, old Batchgrew had

slightly improved. He behaved "heartily," and everybody appreciates

such behaviour in the Five Towns. He was by nature far too insensitive

to notice that the married lovers were treating each other with

that finished courtesy which is the symptom of a tiff or of a

misunderstanding. And the married lovers, noticing that he noticed

nothing, were soon encouraged to make peace; and by means of certain

tones and gestures peace was declared in the very presence of the

unperceiving old brute, which was peculiarly delightful to the

contracting parties.
Rachel had less difficulty with the supper than she feared, whereby

also her good-humour was fostered. With half a cold leg of mutton,

some cheeses, and the magnificent fancy remains of an At Home tea,

arrayed with the d'oyleys and embroidered cloths which brides always

richly receive in the Five Towns, a most handsome and impressive

supper can be concocted. Rachel was astonished at the splendour of her

own table. Mr. Batchgrew treated this supper with unsurpassable tact.

The adjectives he applied to it were short and emphatic and spoken

with a full mouth. He ate the supper; he kept on eating it; he passed

his plate with alacrity; he refused naught. And as the meal neared its

end he emitted those natural inarticulate noises from his throat which

in Persia are a sign of high breeding. Useless for Rachel in her heart

to call him a glutton—his attitude towards her supper was impeccable.
And now the solid part of the supper was over. One extremity of the

Chesterfield had been drawn closer to the fire—an operation easily

possible in its new advantageous position—and Louis as master of the

house had mended the fire after his own method, and Rachel sat upright

(somewhat in the manner of Mrs. Maldon) in the arm-chair opposite Mr.

Batchgrew, extended half-reclining on the Chesterfield. And Mrs. Tams

entered with coffee.
"You'll have coffee, Mr. Batchgrew?" said the hostess.
"Nay, missis! I canna' sleep after it."
Secretly enchanted by the sweet word "missis," Rachel was nevertheless

piqued by this refusal.
"Oh, but you must have some of Louise's coffee," said Louis, standing

negligently in front of the fire.
Already, though under a month old as a husband, Louis, following the

eternal example of good husbands, had acquired the sure belief that

his wife could achieve a higher degree of excellence in certain

affairs than any other wife in the world. He had selected coffee as

Rachel's speciality.
"Louise's?" repeated old Batchgrew, puzzled, in his heavy voice.
Rachel flushed and smiled.
"He calls me Louise, you know," said she.
"Calls you Louise, does he?" Batchgrew muttered indifferently. But he

took a cup of coffee, stirred part of its contents into the saucer

and on to the Chesterfield, and began to sup the remainder with a

prodigious splutter of ingurgitation.
"And you must have a cigarette, too," Louis carelessly insisted. And

Mr. Batchgrew agreed, though it was notorious that he only smoked once

in a blue moon, because all tobacco was apt to be too strong for him.
"You can clear away," Rachel whispered, in the frigid tones of one

accustomed to command cohorts of servants in the luxury of historic

castles.
"Yes, ma'am," Mrs. Tams whispered back nervously, proud as a

major-domo, though with less than a major-domo's aplomb.
No pride, however, could have outclassed Rachel's. She had had a full

day, and the evening was the crown of the day, because in the evening

she was entertaining privately for the first time. She was the one

lady of the party; for these two men she represented woman, and they

were her men. They depended on her for their physical well-being, and

not in vain. She was the hostess; hers to command; hers the complex

responsibility of the house. She had begun supper with painful

timidity, but the timidity had now nearly vanished in the flush

of social success. Critical as only a young wife can be, she was

excellently well satisfied with Louis' performance in the role of

host. She grew more than ever sure that there was only one Louis. See

him manipulate a cigarette—it was the perfection of worldliness and

agreeable, sensuous grace! See him hold a match to Mr. Batchgrew's

cigarette!
Now Mr. Batchgrew smoked a cigarette clumsily. He seemed not to be

able to decide whether a cigarette was something to smoke or something

to eat. Mr. Batchgrew was more ungainly than ever, stretched in his

characteristic attitude at an angle of forty-five degrees; his long

whiskers were more absurdly than ever like two tails of a wire-haired

white dog; his voice more coarsely than ever rolled about the room

like undignified thunder. He was an old, old man, and a sinister. It

was precisely his age that caressed Rachel's pride. That any man so

old should have come to her house for supper, should be treating her

as an equal and with the directness of allusion in conversation due to

a married woman but improper to a young girl—this was very sweet to

Rachel. The subdued stir made by Mrs. Tams in clearing the table was

for Rachel a delicious background to the scene. The one flaw in it

was her short skirt, which she had not had time to change. Louis

had protested that it was entirely in order, and indeed admirably

coquettish, but Rachel would have preferred a long train of soft

drapery disposed with art round the front of her chair.
"What you want here is electricity," said Thomas Batchgrew, gazing

at the incandescent gas; he could never miss a chance, and was never

discouraged in the pursuit of his own advantage.
"You think so?" murmured Louis genially.
"I could put ye in summat as 'u'd—;"
Rachel broke in a clear, calm decision—
"I don't think we shall have any electricity just yet."
The gesture of the economical wife in her was so final that old

Batchgrew raised his eyebrows with a grin at Louis, and Louis

humorously drew down the corners of his mouth in response. It was as

if they had both said, in awe—
"She has spoken!"
And Rachel, still further flattered and happy, was obliged to smile.
When Mrs. Tams had made her last tiptoe journey from the room and

closed the door with due silent respect upon those great ones, the

expression of Thomas Batchgrew's face changed somewhat; he looked

round, as though for spies, and then drew a packet of papers from his

pocket. And the expression of the other two faces changed also. For

the true purpose of the executor's visit was now to be made formally

manifest.
"Now about this statement of account—re Elizabeth Maldon,

deceased," he growled deeply.
"By the way," Louis interrupted him. "Is Julian back?"
"Julian back? Not as I know of," said Mr. Batchgrew aggressively.

"Why?"
"We thought we saw him walking down Moorthorne Road to-night."
"Yes," said Rachel. "We both thought we saw him."
"Happen he is if he aeroplaned it!" said Batchgrew, and fumbled

nervously with the papers.
"It couldn't have been Julian," said Louis, confidently, to Rachel.
"No, it couldn't," said Rachel.
But neither conjured away the secret uneasiness of the other. And

as for Rachel, she knew that all through the evening she had,

inexplicably, been disturbed by an apprehension that Julian, after

his long and strange sojourn in South Africa, had returned to the

district. Why the possible advent of Julian should disconcert her, she

thought she could not divine. Mr. Batchgrew's demeanour as he answered

Louis' question mysteriously increased her apprehension. At one moment

she said to herself, "Of course it wasn't Julian." At the next, "I'm

quite sure I couldn't be mistaken." At the next, "And supposing it was

Julian—what of it?"

II
When Batchgrew and Louis, sitting side by side on the Chesterfield,

began to turn over documents and peer into columns, and carry the

finger horizontally across sheets of paper in search of figures,

Rachel tactfully withdrew, not from the room, but from the

conversation, it being her proper role to pretend that she did not

and could not understand the complicated details which they were

discussing. She expected some rather dazzling revelation of men's

trained methods at this "business interview" (as Louis had announced

it), for her brother and father had never allowed her the slightest

knowledge of their daily affairs. But she was disappointed. She

thought that both the men were somewhat absurdly and self-consciously

trying to be solemn and learned. Louis beyond doubt was

self-conscious—acting as it were to impress his wife—and Batchgrew's

efforts to be hearty and youthful with the young roused her private

ridicule.
Moreover, nothing fresh emerged from the interview. She had known all

of it before from Louis. Batchgrew was merely repeating and resuming.

And Louis was listening with politeness to recitals with which he was

quite familiar. In words almost identical with those already reported

to her by Louis, Batchgrew insisted on the honesty and efficiency of

the valuer in Hanbridge, a lifelong friend of his own, who had for a

specially low fee put a price on the house at Bycars and its contents

for the purpose of a division between Louis and Julian. And now, as

previously with Louis, Rachel failed to comprehend how the valuer, if

he had been favourably disposed towards Louis, as Batchgrew averred,

could at the same time have behaved honestly towards Julian. But

neither Louis nor Batchgrew seemed to realize the point. They

both apparently flattered themselves with much simplicity upon the

partiality of the lifelong friend and valuer for Louis, without

perceiving the logical deduction that if he was partial he was a

rascal. Further, Thomas Batchgrew "rubbed Rachel the wrong way" by

subtly emphasizing his own marvellous abilities as a trustee and

executor, and by assuring Louis repeatedly that all conceivable books

of account, correspondence, and documents were open for his inspection

at any time. Batchgrew, in Rachel's opinion, might as well have said,

"You naturally suspect me of being a knave, but I can prove to you

that you are wrong."
Finally, they came to the grand total of Louis' inheritance, which

Rachel had known by heart for several days past; yet Batchgrew rolled

it out as a piece of tremendous news, and immediately afterwards

hinted that the sum represented less than the true worth of Louis'

inheritance, and that he, Batchgrew, as well as his lifelong friend

the valuer, had been influenced by a partiality for Louis. For

example, he had contrived to put all the house property, except the

house at Bycars, into Julian's share; which was extremely advantageous

for Louis because the federation of the Five Towns into one borough

had rendered property values the most capricious and least calculable

of all worldly possessions.... And Louis tried to smile knowingly at

the knowing trustee and executor with his amiable partiality for one

legatee as against the other. Louis' share, beyond the Bycars house,

was in the gilt-edged stock of limited companies which sold water and

other necessaries of life to the public on their own terms.
Rachel left the pair for a moment, and returned from upstairs with

a grey jacket of Louis' from which she had to unstitch the black

crêpe armlet announcing to the world Louis' grief for his dead

great-aunt; the period of mourning was long over, and it would not

have been quite nice for Louis to continue announcing his grief.
As she came back into the room she heard the word "debentures,"

and that single word changed her mood instantly from bland feminine

toleration to porcupinish defensiveness. She did not, as a fact, know

what debentures were. She could not for a fortune have defined

the difference between a debenture and a share. She only knew that

debentures were connected with "limited companies"—not waterworks

companies, which she classed with the Bank of England—but just any

limited companies, which were in her mind a bottomless pit for the

savings of the foolish. She had an idea that a debenture was, if

anything, more fatal than a share. She was, of course, quite wrong,

according to general principles; but, unfortunately, women, as all men

sooner or later learn, have a disconcerting habit of being right

in the wrong way for the wrong reasons. In a single moment, without

justification, she had in her heart declared war on all debentures.

And as soon as she gathered that Thomas Batchgrew was suggesting to

Louis the exchange of waterworks stock for seven per cent. debentures

in the United Midland Cinemas Corporation, Limited, she became more

than ever convinced that her instinct about debentures was but too

correct. She sat down primly, and detached the armlet, and removed all

the bits of black cotton from the sleeve, and never raised her head

nor offered a remark, but she was furious—furious to protect her

husband against sharks and against himself.
The conduct and demeanour of Thomas Batchgrew were now explained.

His visit, his flattery, his heartiness, his youthfulness, all had a

motive. He had safeguarded Louis' interests under the will in order

to rob him afterwards as a cinematograph speculator. The thing was

as clear as daylight. And yet Louis did not seem to see it. Louis

listened to Batchgrew's ingenious arguments with naïve interest and

was obviously impressed. When Batchgrew called him "a business man as

smart as they make 'em," and then proved that the money so invested

would be as safe as in a stocking, Louis agreed with a great air of

acumen that certainly it would. When Batchgrew pointed out that, under

the proposed new investment, Louis would be receiving in income thirty

or thirty-five shillings for every pound under the old investments,

Louis' eye glistened—positively glistened! Rachel trembled. She saw

her husband beggared, and there was nothing that frightened her more

than the prospect of Louis without a reserve of private income. She

did not argue the position—she simply knew that Louis without sure

resources behind him would be a very dangerous and uncertain Louis,

perhaps a tragic Louis. She frankly admitted this to herself. And old

Batchgrew went on talking and inveigling until Rachel was ready to

believe that the device of debentures had been originally invented by

Thomas Batchgrew himself with felonious intent.
An automobile hooted in the street.
"Well, ye'll think it over," said Thomas Batchgrew.
"Oh I will!" said Louis eagerly.
And Rachel asked herself, almost shaking—"Is it possible that he is

such a simpleton?"
"Only I must know by Tuesday," said Thomas Batchgrew. "I thought I'd

give ye th' chance, but I can't keep it open later than Tuesday."
"Thanks, awfully," said Louis. "I'm very much obliged for the offer.

I'll let you know—before Tuesday."
Rachel frowned as she folded up the jacket. If, however, the two men

could have seen into her mind they would have perceived symptoms of

danger more agitating than one little frown.
"Of course," said Thomas Batchgrew easily, with a short laugh, in the

lobby, "if it hadna been for her making away with that nine

hundred and sixty-odd pound, you'd ha' had a round sum o' thousands to

invest. I've been thinking o'er that matter, and all I can see for it

is as her must ha' thrown th' money into th' fire in mistake for th'

envelope, or with th' envelope. That's all as I can see for it."
Louis flushed slightly as he slapped his thigh.
"Never thought of that!" he cried. "It very probably was that.

Strange it never occurred to me!"
Rachel said nothing. She had extreme difficulty in keeping control of

herself while old Batchgrew, with numerous senile precautions, took

his slow departure. She forgot that she was a hostess and a woman of

the world.

III
"Hello! What's that?" Rachel asked, in a self-conscious voice, when

they were in the parlour again.
Louis had almost surreptitiously taken an envelope from his pocket,

and was extracting a paper from it.
On finding themselves alone they had not followed their usual

custom of bursting into comment, favourable or unfavourable, on the

departed—a practice due more to a desire to rouse and enjoy each

other's individualities than to a genuine interest in the third

person. Nor had they impulsively or deliberately kissed, as they

were liable to do after release from a spell of worldliness. On the

contrary, both were still constrained, as if the third person was

still with them. The fact was that there were two other persons in

the room, darkly discerned by Louis and Rachel—namely, a different,

inimical Rachel and a different, inimical Louis. All four, the seen

and the half-seen, walked stealthily, like rival beasts in the edge of

the jungle.
"Oh!" said Louis with an air of nonchalance. "It came by the last post

while old Batch was here, and I just shoved it into my pocket."
The arrivals of the post were always interesting to them, for during

the weeks after marriage letters are apt to be more numerous than

usual, and to contain delicate and enchanting surprises. Both of

them were always strictly ceremonious in the handling of each other's

letters, and yet both deprecated this ceremoniousness in the beloved.

Louis urged Rachel to open his letters without scruple, and Rachel

did the same to Louis. But both—Louis by chivalry and Rachel by

pride—were prevented from acting on the invitation. The envelope in

Louis' hand did not contain a letter, but only a circular. The fact

that the flap of the envelope was unsealed and the stamp a

mere halfpenny ought rightly to have deprived the packet of all

significance as a subject of curiosity. Nevertheless, the different,

inimical Rachel, probably out of sheer perversity, went up to Louis

and looked over his shoulder as he read the communication, which was a

printed circular, somewhat yellowed, with blanks neatly filled in, and

the whole neatly signed by a churchwarden, informing Louis that his

application for sittings at St. Luke's Church (commonly called the Old

Church) had been granted. It is to be noted that, though applications

for sittings in the Old Church were not overwhelmingly frequent, and

might indeed very easily have been coped with by means of autograph

replies, the authorities had a sufficient sense of dignity always to

circularize the applicants.
This document, harmless enough, and surely a proof of laudable

aspirations in Louis, gravely displeased the different, inimical

Rachel, and was used by her for bellicose purposes.
"So that's it, is it?" she said ominously.
"But wasn't it understood that we were to go to the Old Church?" said

the other Louis, full of ingenious innocence.
"Oh! Was it?"
"Didn't I mention it?"
"I don't remember."
"I'm sure I did."
The truth was that Louis had once casually remarked that he supposed

they would attend the Old Church. Rachel would have joyously attended

any church or any chapel with him. At Knype she had irregularly

attended the Bethesda Chapel—sometimes (in the evenings) with her

father, oftener alone, never with her brother. During her brief

employment with Mrs. Maldon she had been only once to a place of

worship, the new chapel in Moorthorne Road, which was the nearest to

Bycars and had therefore been favoured by Mrs. Maldon when her

limbs were stiff. In the abstract she approved of religious rites.

Theologically her ignorance was such that she could not have

distinguished between the tenets of church and the tenets of chapel,

and this ignorance she shared with the large majority of the serious

inhabitants of the Five Towns. Why, then, should she have "pulled a

face" (as the saying down there is) at the Old Parish Church?
One reason, which would have applied equally to church or chapel, was

that she was disconcerted and even alarmed by Louis' manifest tendency

to settle down into utter correctness. Louis had hitherto been a

devotee of joy—never as a bachelor had he done aught to increase the

labour of churchwardens—and it was somehow as a devotee of joy that

Rachel had married him. Rachel had been settled down all her life, and

naturally desired and expected that an unsettling process should now

occur in her career. It seemed to her that in mere decency Louis

might have allowed at any rate a year or two to pass before occupying

himself so stringently with her eternal welfare. She belonged to the

middle class (intermediate between the industrial and the aristocratic

employing) which is responsible for the Five Towns' reputation for

joylessness, the class which sticks its chin out and gets things done

(however queer the things done may be), the class which keeps the

district together and maintains its solidity, the class which is

ashamed of nothing but idleness, frank enjoyment, and the caprice of

the moment. (Its idiomatic phrase for expressing the experience of

gladness, "I sang 'O be joyful,'" alone demonstrates its unwillingness

to rejoice.) She had espoused the hedonistic class (always secretly

envied by the other), and Louis' behaviour as a member of that class

had already begun to disappoint her. Was it fair of him to say in his

conduct: "The fun is over. We must be strictly conventional now"? His

costly caprices for Llandudno and the pleasures of idleness were quite

beside the point.
Another reason for her objection to Louis' overtures to the Old Church

was that they increased her suspicion of his snobbishness. No person

nourished from infancy in chapel can bring himself to believe that

the chief motive of church-goers is not the snobbish motive of social

propriety. And dissenters are so convinced that, if chapel means

salvation in the next world, church means salvation in this, that to

this day, regardless of the feelings of their pastors, they will go

to church once in their lives—to get married. At any rate, Rachel was

positively sure that no anxiety about his own soul or about hers had

led Louis to join the Old Church.
"Have you been confirmed?" she asked.
"Yes, of course," Louis replied politely.
She did not like that "of course."
"Shall I have to be?"
"I don't know."
"Well," said she, "I can tell you one thing—I shan't be."

IV
Rachel went on—
"You aren't really going to throw your money away on those debenture

things of Mr. Batchgrew's, are you?"
Louis now knew the worst, and he had been suspecting it. Rachel's tone

fully displayed her sentiments, and completed the disclosure that "the

little thing" was angry and aggressive. (In his mind Louis regarded

her at moments, as "the little thing.") But his own politeness was

so profoundly rooted that practically no phenomenon of rudeness could

overthrow it.
"No," he said, "I'm not going to 'throw my money away' on them."
"That's all right, then," she said, affecting not to perceive his

drift. "I thought you were."
"But I propose to put my money into them, subject to anything you, as

a financial expert, may have to say."
Nervously she had gone to the window and was pretending to straighten

a blind.
"I don't think you need to make fun of me," she said. "You think I

don't notice when you make fun of me. But I do—always."
"Look here, young 'un," Louis suddenly began to cajole, very

winningly.
"I'm about as old as you are," said she, "and perhaps in some ways a

bit older. And I must say I really wonder at you being ready to help

Mr. Batchgrew after the way he insulted me in the cinema."
"Insulted you in the cinema!" Louis cried, genuinely startled, and

then somewhat hurt because Rachel argued like a woman instead of like

a man. In reflecting upon the excellences of Rachel he had often

said to himself that her unique charm consisted in the fact that she

combined the attractiveness of woman with the powerful commonsense of

man. In common with a whole enthusiastic army of young husbands he had

been convinced that his wife was the one female creature on earth to

whom you could talk as you would to a male. "Oh!" he murmured.
"Have you forgotten it, then?" she asked coldly. To herself she was

saying: "Why am I behaving like this? After all, he's done no harm

yet." But she had set out, and she must continue, driven by the

terrible fear of what he might do. She stared at the blind. Through a

slit of window at one side of it she could see the lamp-post and the

iron kerb of the pavement.
"But that's all over long ago," he protested amiably. "Just look how

friendly you were with him yourself over supper! Besides—"
"Besides what? I wasn't friendly. I was only polite. I had to be.

Nobody's called Mr. Batchgrew worse names than you have. But you

forget. Only I don't forget. There's lots of things I don't forget,

although I don't make a song about them. I shan't forget in a hurry

how you let go of my bike without telling me and I fell all over the

road. I know I'm lots more black and blue even than I was."
If Rachel would but have argued according to his rules of debate,

Louis was confident that he could have conducted the affair to a

proper issue. But she would not. What could he say? In a flash he

saw a vista of, say, forty years of conjugal argument with a woman

incapable of reason, and trembled. Then he looked again, and saw

the lines of Rachel's figure in her delightful short skirt and was

reassured. But still he did not know what to say. Rachel spared

him further cogitation on that particular aspect of the question

by turning round and exclaiming, passionately, with a break in her

voice—
"Can't you see that he'll swindle you out of the money?"
It seemed to her that the security of their whole future depended on

her firmness and strong sagacity at that moment. She felt herself to

be very wise and also, happily, very vigorous. But at the same time

she was afflicted by a kind of despair at the thought that Louis had

indeed been, and still was, ready to commit the disastrous folly of

confiding money to Thomas Batchgrew for investment. And as Louis had

had a flashing vision of the future, so did Rachel now have such a

vision. But hers was more terrible than his. Louis foresaw merely

vexation. Rachel foresaw ruin doubtfully staved off by eternal

vigilance on her part and by nothing else—an instant's sleepiness,

and they might be in the gutter and she the wife of a ne'er-do-well.

She perceived that she must be reconciled to a future in which the

strain of intense vigilance could never once be relaxed. Strange that

a creature so young and healthy and in love should be so pessimistic,

but thus it was! She remembered in in spite of herself the warnings

against Louis which she had been compelled to listen to in the

previous year.
"Odd, of course!" said Louis. "But I can't exactly see how he'll

swindle me out of the money! A debenture is a debenture."
"Is it?"
"Do you know what a debenture is, my child?"
"I don't need to know what a debenture is, when Mr. Batchgrew's mixed

up in it."
Louis suppressed a sigh. He first thought of trying to explain to her

just what a debenture was. Then he abandoned the enterprise as too

complicated, and also as futile. Though he should prove to her that

a debenture combined the safety of the Bank of England with the

brilliance of a successful gambling transaction, she would not budge.

He was acquiring valuable and painful knowledge concerning women every

second. He grew sad, not simply with the weight of this new knowledge,

but more because, though he had envisaged certain difficulties of

married existence, he had not envisaged this difficulty. He had not

dreamed that a wife would demand a share, and demand it furiously, in

the control of his business affairs. He had sincerely imagined

that wives listened with much respect and little comprehension when

business was on the carpet, content to murmur soothingly from time to

time, "Just as you think best, dear." Life had unpleasantly astonished

him.
It was on the tip of his tongue to say to Rachel, with steadying

facetiousness—
"You mustn't forget that I know a bit about these things, having spent

years of my young life in a bank."
But a vague instinct told him that to draw attention to his career in

the bank might be unwise—at any rate, in principle.
"Can't you see," Rachel charged again, "that Mr. Batchgrew has only

been flattering you all this time so as to get hold of your money? And

wasn't it just like him to begin again harping on the electricity?>"
"Flattering me?"
"Well, he couldn't bear you before—if you'd only heard the things he

used to say!—and now he simply licks your boots."
"What things did he say?" Louis asked, disturbed.
"Oh, never mind!"
Louis became rather glum and obstinate.
"The money will be perfectly safe," he insisted, "and our income

pretty nearly doubled. I suppose I ought to know more about these

things than you."
"What's the use of income being doubled if you lose the capital?"

Rachel snapped, now taking a horrid, perverse pleasure in the perilous

altercation. "And if it's so safe why is he ready to give you so much

interest?"
The worst of women, Louis reflected, is that in the midst of a silly

argument that you can shatter in ten words they will by a fluke insert

some awkward piece of genuine ratiocination, the answer to which must

necessarily be lengthy and ineffective.
"It's no good arguing," he said pleasantly, and then repeated, "I

ought to know more about these things than you."
Rachel raised her voice in exasperation—
"I don't see it, I don't see it at all. If it hadn't been for me you'd

have thrown up your situation—and a nice state of affairs there would

have been then! And how much money would you have wasted on holidays

and so on and so on if I hadn't stopped you, I should like to know!"
Louis was still more astonished. Indeed, he was rather nettled. His

urbanity was unimpaired, but he permitted himself a slight acidity of

tone as he retorted with gentle malice—
"Well, you can't help the colour of your hair. So I'll keep my nerve."
"I didn't expect to be insulted!" cried Rachel, flushing far redder

than that rich hair of hers, and paced pompously out of the room, her

face working violently. The door was ajar. She passed Mrs. Tams on the

stairs, blindly, with lowered head.

V
In the conjugal bedroom, full of gas-glare and shadows, there were two

old women. One was Mrs. Tams, ministering; the other was Rachel Fores,

once and not long ago the beloved and courted girlish Louise of a

chevalier, now aged by all the sorrow of the world. She lay in bed—in

her bed nearest the fireplace and farthest from the door.
She had undressed herself with every accustomed ceremony, arranging

each article of attire, including the fine frock left on the bed,

carefully in its place, as is meet in a chamber where tidiness depends

on the loyal cooperation of two persons, but through her tears.

She had slipped sobbing into bed. The other bed was empty, and its

emptiness seemed sinister to her. Would it ever be occupied again?

Impossible that it should ever be occupied again! Its rightful

occupant was immeasurably far off, along miles of passages, down

leagues of stairs, separated by impregnable doors, in another

universe, the universe of the ground floor. Of course she might have

sprung up, put on her enchanting dressing-gown, tripped down a few

steps in a moment of time, and peeped in at the parlour door—just

peeped in, in that magic ribboned peignoir, and glanced—and the whole

planet would have been reborn. But she could not. If the salvation of

the human race had depended on it, she could not—partly because she

was a native of the Five Towns, where such things are not done, and no

doubt partly because she was just herself.
She was now more grieved than angry with Louis. He had been wrong; he

was a foolish, unreliable boy—but he was a boy. Whereas she was his

mother, and ought to have known better. Yes, she had become his mother

in the interval. For herself she experienced both pity and anger. What

angered her was her clumsiness. Why had she lost her temper and her

head? She saw clearly how she might have brought him round to her view

with a soft phrase, a peculiar inflection, a tiny appeal, a caress,

a mere dimpling of the cheek. She saw him revolving on her little

finger.... She knew all things now because she was so old. And then

suddenly she was bathing luxuriously in self-pity, and young and

imperious, and violently resentful of the insult which he had put upon

her—an insult which recalled the half-forgotten humiliations of her

school-days, when loutish girls had baptized her with the name of a

vegetable.... And then, again suddenly, she deeply desired that Louis

should come upstairs and bully her.
She attached a superstitious and terrible importance to the tragical

episode in the parlour because it was their first quarrel as husband

and wife. True, she had stormed at him before their engagement, but

even then he had kept intact his respect for her, whereas now, a

husband, he had shamed her. The breach, she knew, could never be

closed. She had only to glance at the empty bed to be sure that it was

eternal. It had been made slowly yet swiftly; and it was complete and

unbridgable ere she had realized its existence. When she contrasted

the idyllic afternoon with the tragedy of the night, she was astounded

by the swiftness of the change. The catastrophe lay, not in the

threatened loss of vast sums of money and consequent ruin—that had

diminished to insignificance!—but in the breach.
And then Mrs. Tams had inserted herself in the bedroom. Mrs. Tams knew

or guessed everything. And she would not pretend that she did not; and

Rachel would not pretend—did not even care to pretend, for Mrs. Tams

was so unimportant that nobody minded her. Mrs. Tams had heard and

seen. She commiserated. She stroked timidly with her gnarled hand the

short, fragile sleeve of the nightgown, whereat Rachel sobbed afresh,

with more plenteous tears, and tried to articulate a word, and could

not till the third attempt. The word was "handkerchief." She was not

weeping in comfort. Mrs. Tams was aware of the right drawer and

drew from it a little white thing—yet not so little, for Rachel was

Rachel!—and shook out its quadrangular folds, and it seemed beautiful

in the gaslight; and Rachel took it and sobbed "Thank you."
Mrs. Tams rose higher than even a general servant; she was the

soubrette, the confidential maid, the very echo of the young and

haughty mistress, leagued with the worshipped creature against the

wickedness and wile of a whole sex. Mrs. Tams had no illusions save

the sublime illusion that her mistress was an angel and a martyr. Mrs.

Tams had been married, and she had seen a daughter married. She was

an authority on first quarrels and could and did tell tales of first

quarrels—tales in which the husband, while admittedly an utterly

callous monster, had at the same time somehow some leaven of decency.

Soon she was launched in the epic recital of the birth and death of

a grandchild; Rachel, being a married women like the rest, could

properly listen to every interesting and recondite detail. Rachel

sobbed and sympathized with the classic tale. And both women, as it

was unrolled, kept well in their minds the vision of the vile man,

mysterious and implacable, alone in the parlour. Occasionally Mrs.

Tams listened for a footstep, ready discreetly to withdraw at the

slightest symptom on the stairs. Once when she did this, Rachel

murmured, weakly, "He won't—" and then lapsed into new weeping. And

after a little time Mrs. Tams departed.

VI
Mrs. Tams had decided to undertake an enterprise involving extreme

gallantry—surpassing the physical. She went downstairs and stood

outside the parlour door, which was not quite shut. Within the

parlour, or throne-room, existed a beautiful and superior being, full

of grace and authority, who belonged to a race quite different from

her own, who was beyond her comprehension, who commanded her and kept

her alive and paid money to her, who accepted her devotion casually

as a right, who treated her as a soft cushion between himself and

the drift and inconvenience of the world, and who occasionally, as a

supreme favour, caught her a smart slap on the back, which flattered

her to excess. She went into the throne-room if she was called

thither, or if she had cleansing or tidying work there; she spoke to

the superior being if he spoke to her. But she had never till then

conceived the breath-taking scheme of entering the throne-room for

a purpose of her own, and addressing the superior being without an

invitation to do so.
Nevertheless, since by long practice she was courageous, she meant to

execute the scheme. And she began by knocking at the door. Although

Rachel had seriously warned her that for a domestic servant to

knock at the parlour door was a grave sin, she simply could not help

knocking. Not to knock seemed to her wantonly sacrilegious. Thus she

knocked, and a voice told her to come in.
There was the superior being, his back to the fire and his legs

apart—formidable!
She curtsied—another sin according to the new code. Then she

discovered that she was inarticulate.
"Well?"
Words burst from her—
"Her's crying her eyes out up yon, mester."
And Mrs. Tams also snivelled.
The superior being frowned and said testily, yet not without a touch

of careless toleration—
"Oh, get away, you silly old fool of a woman!"
Mrs. Tarns got away, not entirely ill-content.
In the lobby she heard an unusual rapping on the glass of the front

door, and sharply opened it to inform the late disturber that there

existed a bell and a knocker for respectable people. A shabby youth

gave her a note for "Louis Fores, Esq.," and said that there was an

answer. So that she was forced to renew the enterprise of entering the

throne-room.
In another couple of minutes Louis was running upstairs. His wife

heard him, and shook in bed from excitement at the crisis which

approached. But she could never have divined the nature of the

phenomenon by which the unbridgable breach was about to be closed.
"Louise!"
"Yes," she whimpered. Then she ventured to spy at his face through

an interstice of the bedclothes, and saw thereon a most queer, white

expression.
"Some one's just brought this. Read it."
He gave her the note, and she deciphered it as well as she could—
DEAR Louis,—If you aren't gone to bed I want to see you
to-night about that missing money of aunt's. I've something I
must tell you and Rachel. I'm at the "Three Tuns."
JULIAN MALDON.
"But what does he mean?" demanded Rachel, roused from her heavy mood

of self-pity.
"I don't know."
"But what can he mean?" she insisted.
"Haven't a notion."
"But he must mean something!"
Louis asked—
"Well, what should you say he means?"
"How very strange!" Rachel murmured, not attempting to answer the

question. "And the 'Three Tuns'! Why does he write from the 'Three

Tuns'? What's he doing at the 'Three Tuns'? Isn't it a very low

public-house? And everybody thought he was still in South Africa!... I

suppose, then, it must have been him that we saw to-night."
"You may bet it was."
"Then why didn't he come straight here? That's what I want to know. He

couldn't have called before we got here, because if he had Mrs. Tams

would have told us."
Louis nodded.
"Didn't you think Mr. Batchgrew looked very queer when you

mentioned Julian to-night?" Rachel continued to express her curiosity

and wonder.
"No. I didn't notice anything particular," Louis replied vaguely.
Throughout the conversation his manner was self-conscious. Rachel

observed it, while feigning the contrary, and in her turn grew uneasy

and even self-conscious also. Further, she had the feeling that Louis

was depending upon her for support, and perhaps for initiative. His

glance, though furtive, had the appealing quality which rendered him

sometimes so exquisitely wistful to her. As he stood over her by the

bed, he made a peculiar compound of the negligent, dominant masculine

and the clinging feminine.
"And why didn't he let anybody know of his return?" Rachel went on.
Louis, veering towards the masculine, clenched the immediate point—
"The question before the meeting is," he smiled demurely, "what answer

am I to send?"
"I suppose you must see him to-night."
"Nothing else for it, is there? Well, I'll scribble him a bit of a

note."
"But I shan't see him, Louis."
"No?"
In an instant Rachel thought to herself: "He doesn't want me to see

him."
Aloud she said: "I should have to dress myself all over again.

Besides, I'm not fit to be seen."
She was referring, without any apparent sort of shame, to the redness

of her eyes.
"Well, I'll see him by myself, then."
Louis turned to leave the bedroom. Whereat Rachel was very

disconcerted and disappointed. Although the startling note from Julian

had alarmed her and excited in her profound apprehensions whose very

nature she would scarcely admit to herself, the main occupation of her

mind was still her own quarrel with Louis. The quarrel was now over,

for they had conversed in quite sincere tones of friendliness, but she

had desired and expected an overt, tangible proof and symbol of peace.

That proof and symbol was a kiss.
Louis was at the door ... he was beyond the door ... she was lost.
"Louis!" she cried.
He put his face in at the door.
"Will you just pass me my hand-mirror. It's on the dressing-table."
Louis was thrilled by this simple request. The hand-mirror had arrived

in the house as a wedding-present. It was backed with tortoise-shell,

and seemingly the one thing that had reconciled Rachel the

downright to the possession of a hand-mirror was the fact that the

tortoise-shell was real tortoise-shell. She had "made out" that a

hand-mirror was too frivolous an object for the dressing-table of

a serious Five Towns woman. She had always referred to it as "the"

hand-mirror—as though disdaining special ownership. She had derided

it once by using it in front of Louis with the mimic foolish graces of

an empty-headed doll. And now she was asking for it because she wanted

it; and she had said "my" hand-mirror!
This revelation of the odalisque in his Rachel enchanted Louis, and

incidentally it also enchanted Rachel. She had employed a desperate

remedy, and the result on both of them filled her with a most

surprising gladness. Louis judged it to be deliciously right that

Rachel should be anxious to know whether her weeping had indeed made

her into an object improper for the beholding of the male eye, and

Rachel to her astonishment shared his opinion. She was "vain," and

they were both well content. In taking it she touched his hand. He

bent and kissed her. Each of them was ravaged by formidable fears for

the future, tremendously disturbed in secret by the mysterious word

from Julian; and yet that kiss stood unique among their kisses, and

in their simplicity they knew not why. And as they kissed they hated

Julian, and the past, and the whole world, for thus coming between

them and deranging their love. They would, had it been possible, have

sold all the future for tranquillity in that moment.

VII
Going downstairs, Louis found Mrs. Tarns standing in the back part of

the lobby between the parlour door and the kitchen; obviously she had

stationed herself there in order to keep watch on the messenger from

the "Three Tuns." As the master of the house approached with dignity

the foot of the stairs, the messenger stirred, and in the classic

manner of messengers fingered uneasily his hat. The fingers were

dirty. The hat was dirty and shabby. It had been somebody else's hat

before coming into the possession of the messenger. The same applied

to his jacket and trousers. The jacket was well cut, but green; the

trousers, with their ragged, muddy edges, yet betrayed a pattern of

distinction. Round his neck the messenger wore a thin muffler, and

on his feet an exhausted pair of tennis-shoes. These noiseless shoes

accentuated and confirmed the stealthy glance of his eyes. Except for

an unshaven chin, and the confidence-destroying quality that lurked

subtly in his aspect, he was not repulsive to look upon. His features

were delicate enough, his restless mouth was even pretty, and

his carriage graceful. He had little of the coarseness of

industrialism—probably because he was not industrial. His age was

about twenty, and he might have sold Signals in the street, or

run illegal errands for street-bookmakers. At any rate, it was certain

that he was not above earning a chance copper from a customer of the

"Three Tuns." His clear destiny was never to inspire respect or trust,

nor to live regularly (save conceivably in prison), nor to do any

honest daily labour. And if he did not know this, he felt it. All his

movements were those of an outcast who both feared and execrated the

organism that was rejecting him.
Louis, elegant, self-possessed, and superior, passed into the parlour

exactly as if the messenger had been invisible. He was separated from

the messenger by an immeasurable social prestige. He was raised to

such an altitude above the messenger that he positively could not see

the messenger with the naked eye. And yet for one fraction of a second

he had the illusion of being so intimately akin to the messenger

that a mere nothing might have pushed him into those vile clothes

and endowed him with that furtive look and that sinister aspect of

a helot. For one infinitesimal instant he was the messenger; and

shuddered. Then the illusion as swiftly faded, and—such being Louis'

happy temperament—was forgotten. He disappeared into the parlour,

took a piece of paper and an envelope from the small writing-table

behind Rachel's chair, and wrote a short note to Julian—a note from

which facetiousness was not absent—inviting him to come at once. He

rang the bell. Mrs. Tams entered, full of felicity because the great

altercation was over and concord established.
"Give this to that chap," said Louis, casually imperative, holding out

the note but scarcely glancing at Mrs. Tams.
"Yes, sir," said Mrs. Tarns with humble eagerness, content to be a

very minor tool in the hidden designs of the exalted.
"And then you can go to bed."
"Oh! It's of no consequence, I'm sure, sir," Mrs. Tams answered.
Louis heard her say importantly and condescendingly to the messenger—
"Here ye are, young man."
She shut the front door as though much relieved to get such a source

of peril and infection out of the respectable house.
Immediately afterwards strange things happened to Louis in the

parlour. He had intended to return at once to his wife in order to

continue the vague, staggered conversation about Julian's thunderbolt.

But he discovered that he could not persuade himself to rejoin Rachel.

A self-consciousness, growing every moment more acute and troublesome,

prevented him from so doing. He was afraid that he could not discuss

the vanished money without blushing, and it happened rarely that he

lost control of his features, which indeed he could as a rule mould

to the expression of a cherub whenever desirable. So he sat down in

a chair, the first chair to hand, any chair, and began to reflect. Of

course he was safe. The greatest saint on earth could not have been

safer than he was from conviction of a crime. He might be suspected,

but nothing could possibly be proved against him. Moreover, despite

his self-consciousness, he felt innocent; he really did feel innocent,

and even ill-used. The money had forced itself upon him in an

inexcusable way; he was convinced that he had never meant to

misappropriate it; assuredly he had received not a halfpenny of

benefit from it. The fault was entirely the old lady's. Yes, he was

innocent and he was safe.
Nevertheless, he did not at all like the resuscitation of the affair.

The affair had been buried. How characteristic of the inconvenient

Julian to rush in from South Africa and dig it up! Everybody concerned

had decided that the old lady on the night of her attack had not been

responsible for her actions. She had annihilated the money—whether by

fire, as Batchgrew had lately suggested, or otherwise, did not matter.

Or, if she had not annihilated the money, she had "done something"

with it—something unknown and unknowable. Such was the acceptable

theory, in which Louis heartily concurred. The loss was his—at least

half the loss was his—and others had no right to complain. But Julian

was without discretion. Within twenty-four hours Julian might well set

the whole district talking.
Louis was dimly aware that the district already had talked, but he was

not aware to what extent it had talked. Neither he nor anybody else

was aware how the secret had escaped out of the house. Mrs. Tarns

would have died rather than breathe a word. Rachel, naturally, had

said naught; nor had Louis. Old Batchgrew had decided that his highest

interest also was to say naught, and he had informed none save Julian.

Julian might have set the secret free in South Africa, but in a highly

distorted form it had been current in certain strata of Five Towns

society long before it could have returned from South Africa. The

rough, commonsense verdict of those select few who had winded the

secret was simply that "there had been some hanky-panky," and that

beyond doubt Louis was "at the bottom of it," but that it had little

importance, as Mrs. Maldon was dead, poor thing. As for Julian, "a

rough customer, though honest as the day," he was reckoned to be

capable of protecting his own interests.
And then, amid all his apprehensions, a new hope sprouted in Louis'

mind. Perhaps Julian was acquainted with some fact that might lead to

the recovery of a part of the money. Had Louis not always held

that the pile of notes which had penetrated into his pocket did

not represent the whole of the nine hundred and sixty-five pounds?

Conceivably it represented about half of the total, in which case a

further sum of, say, two hundred and fifty pounds might be coming to

Louis. Already he was treating this two hundred and fifty pounds as

a windfall, and wondering in what most pleasant ways he could employ

it!... But with what kind of fact could Julian be acquainted?...

Had Julian been dishonest? Louis would have liked to think Julian

dishonest, but he could not. Then what ...?
He heard movements above. And the front gate creaked. As if a spring

had been loosed, he jumped from the chair and ran upstairs—away from

the arriving Julian and towards his wife. Rachel was just getting up.
"Don't trouble," he said. "I'll see him. I'll deal with him. Much

better for you to stay in bed."
He perceived that he did not want Rachel to hear what Julian had to

say until after he had heard it himself.
Rachel hesitated.
"Do you think so?... What have you been doing? I thought you were

coming up again at once."
"I had one or two little things—"
A terrific knock resounded on the front door.
"There he is!" Louis muttered, as it were aghast.

CHAPTER XI
JULIAN'S DOCUMENT

I
Julian Maldon faced Louis in the parlour. Louis had conducted him

there without the assistance of Mrs. Tams, who had been not merely

advised, but commanded, to go to bed. Julian had entered the house

like an exasperated enemy—glum, suspicious, and ferocious. His mien

seemed to say: "You wanted me to come, and I've come. But mind you

don't drive me to extremities." Impossible to guess from his grim

face that he had asked permission to come! Nevertheless he had shaken

Louis' hand with a ferocious sincerity which Louis felt keenly the

next morning. He was the same Julian except that he had grown a brown

beard. He had exactly the same short, thick-set figure, and the same

defiant stare. South Africa had not changed him. No experience could

change him. He would have returned from ten years at the North Pole

or at the Equator, with savages or with uncompromising intellectuals,

just the same Julian. He was one of those beings who are violently

themselves all the time. By some characteristic social clumsiness

he had omitted to remove his overcoat in the lobby. And now, in

the parlour, he could not get it off. As a man seated, engaged in

conversation by a woman standing, forgets to rise at once and then

cannot rise, finding himself glued to the chair, so was Julian with

his overcoat; to take it off he would have had to flay himself alive.
"Won't you take off your overcoat?" Louis suggested.
"No."
With his instinctive politeness Louis turned to improve the fire.

And as he poked among the coals he said, in the way of amiable

conversation—
"How's South Africa?"
"All right," replied Julian, who hated to impart his sensations. If

Julian had witnessed Napoleon's retreat from Moscow he would have come

to the Five Towns and, if questioned—not otherwise—would have said

that it was all right.
Louis, however, suspected that his brevity was due to Julian's

resentment of any inquisitiveness concerning his doings in South

Africa; and he therefore at once abandoned South Africa as a subject

of talk, though he was rather curious to know what, indeed, Julian had

been about in South Africa for six mortal months. Nobody in the Five

Towns knew for certain what Julian had been about in South Africa. It

was understood that he had gone there as a commercial traveller

for his own wares, when his business was in a highly unsatisfactory

condition, and that he had meant to stay for only a month. The

excursion had been deemed somewhat mad, but not more mad than sundry

other deeds of Julian. Then Julian's manager, Foulger, had (it

appeared) received authority to assume responsible charge of the

manufactory until further notice. From that moment the business had

prospered: a result at which nobody was surprised, because Foulger was

notoriously a "good man" who had hitherto been baulked in his ideas by

an obstinate young employer.
In a community of stiff-necked employers, Julian already held a high

place for the quality of being stiff-necked. Jim Horrocleave, for

example, had a queer, murderous manner with customers and with

"hands," but Horrocleave was friendly towards scientific ideas in the

earthenware industry, and had even given half a guinea to the fund for

encouraging technical education in the district. Whereas Julian Maldon

not only terrorized customers and work-people (the latter nevertheless

had a sort of liking for him), but was bitingly scornful of "cranky

chemists," or "Germans," as he called the scientific educated experts.

He was the pure essence of the British manufacturer. He refused to

make what the market wanted, unless the market happened to want what

he wanted to make. He hated to understand the reasons underlying

the processes of manufacture, or to do anything which had not been

regularly done for at least fifty years. And he accepted orders like

insults. The wonder was, not that he did so little business, but that

he did so much. Still, people did respect him. His aunt Maldon, with

her skilled habit of finding good points in mankind, had thought that

he must be remarkably intelligent because he was so rude.
Beyond a vague rumour that Julian had established a general pottery

agency in Cape Town with favourable prospects, no further news of

him had reached England. But of course it was admitted that his

inheritance had definitely saved the business, and also much improved

his situation in the eyes of the community ... And now he had achieved

a reappearance which in mysteriousness excelled even his absence.
"So you see we're installed here," said Louis, when he had finished

with the fire.
"Aye!" muttered Julian dryly, and shut his lips.
Louis tried no more conversational openings. He was afraid. He waited

for Julian's initiative as for an earthquake; for he knew now at the

roots of his soul that the phrasing of the note was misleading, and

that Julian had come to charge him with having misappropriated the sum

of nine hundred and sixty-five pounds. He had, in reality, surmised as

much on first reading the note, but somehow he had managed to put away

the surmise as absurd and incredible.
After a formidable silence Julian said savagely—
"Look here. I've got something to tell you. I've written it all down,

and I thought to send it ye by post. But after I'd written it I said

to myself I'd tell it ye face to face or I'd die for it. And so here I

am."
"Oh!" Louis murmured. He would have liked to be genially facetious,

but his mouth was dried up. He could not ask any questions. He waited.
"Where's missis?" Julian demanded.
Louis started, not instantly comprehending.
"Rachel? She's—she's in bed. She'd gone to bed before you sent

round."
"Well, I'll thank ye to get her up, then!" Julian pronounced. "She's

got to hear this at first hand, not at second." His gaze expressed a

frank distrust of Louis.
"But—"
At this moment Rachel came into the parlour, apparently fully dressed.

Her eyes were red, but her self-control was complete.
Julian glared at Louis as at a trapped liar.
"I thought ye said she was in bed."
"She was," said Louis. He could find nothing to say to his wife.
Rachel nonchalantly held out her hand.
"So you've come," she said.
"Aye!" said Julian gruffly, and served Rachel's hand as he had served

Louis'.
She winced without concealment.
"Was it you we saw going down Moorthorne Road to-night?" she asked.
"It was," said Julian, looking at the carpet.
"Well, why didn't you come in then?"
"I couldn't make up my mind, if you must know."
"Aren't you going to sit down?"
Julian sat down.
Louis reflected that women were astonishing and incalculable, and the

discovery seemed to him original, even profound. Imagine her tackling

Julian in this fashion, with no preliminaries! She might have seen

Julian last only on the previous day! The odalisque had vanished in

this chill and matter-of-fact housewife.
"And why were you at the 'Three Tuns'?" she went on.
Julian replied with extraordinary bitterness—
"I was at the 'Three Tuns' because I was at the 'Three Tuns.'"
"I see you've grown a beard," said Rachel.
"Happen I have," said Julian. "But what I say is, I've got something

to tell you two. I've written it all down and I thought to post it to

ye. But after I'd written it I says to myself, 'I'll tell 'em face to

face or I'll die for it.'"
"Is it about that money?" Rachel inquired.
"Aye!"
"Then Mr. Batchgrew did write and tell you about it. Won't you take

that great, thick overcoat off?"
Julian jumped up as if in fury, pulled off the overcoat with violent

gestures, and threw in on the Chesterfield. Then he sat down again,

and, sticking out his chin, stared inimically at Louis.
Louis' throat was now so tight that he was nervously obliged to make

the motion of swallowing. He could look neither at Rachel nor at

Julian. He was nonplussed. He knew not what to expect nor what

he feared. He could not even be sure that what he feared was an

accusation. "I am safe. I am safe," he tried to repeat to himself,

deeply convinced, nevertheless, against his reason, that he was not

safe. The whole scene, every aspect of it, baffled and inexpressibly

dismayed him.
Julian still stared, with mouth open, threatening. Then he slapped his

knee.
"Nay!" said he. "I shall read it to ye." And he drew some sheets of

foolscap from his pocket. He opened the sheets, and frowned at them,

and coughed. "Nay!" said he. "There's nothing else for it. I must

smoke."
And he produced a charred pipe which might or might not have been

the gift of Mrs. Maldon, filled it, struck a match on his boot,

and turbulently puffed outrageous quantities of smoke. Louis, with

singular courage, lit a cigarette, which gave him a little ease of

demeanour, if not confidence.

II
And then at length Julian began to read—
"'Before I went to South Africa last autumn I found myself in

considerable business difficulties. The causes of said difficulties

were bad trade, unfair competition, and price-cutting at home and

abroad, especially in Germany, and the modern spirit of unrest among

the working-classes making it impossible for an employer to be master

on his own works. I was not insolvent, but I needed capital, the

life-blood of industry. In justice to myself I ought to explain that

my visit to South Africa was very carefully planned and thought out. I

had a good reason to believe that a lot of business in door-furniture

could be done there, and that I could obtain some capital from a

customer in Durban. I point this out merely because trade rivals have

tried to throw ridicule upon me for going out to South Africa when I

did. I must ask you to read carefully'—you see, this was a letter

to you," he interjected—"read carefully all that I say. I will now

proceed."
"'When I came to Aunt Maldon's the night before I left for South

Africa I wanted a wash, and I went into the back room—I mean the room

behind the parlour—and took off my coat preparatory to going into

the scullery to perform my ablutions. While in the back room I noticed

that the picture nearest the cupboard opposite the door was hung very

crooked. When I came back to put my coat on again after washing, my

eye again caught the picture. There was a chair almost beneath it.

I got on the chair and put the picture into an horizontal position.

While I was standing on the chair I could see on the top of the

cupboard, where something white struck my attention. It was behind the

cornice of the cupboard, but I could see it. I took it off the top of

the cupboard and carefully scrutinized it by the gas, which, as you

know, is at the corner of the fireplace, close to the cupboard. It

was a roll consisting of Bank of England notes, to the value of four

hundred and fifty pounds. I counted them at once, while I was standing

on the chair. I then put them in the pocket of my coat which I had

already put on. I wish to point out that if the chair had not been

under the picture I should in all human probability not have attempted

to straighten the picture. Also—'"
"But surely, Julian," Louis interrupted him, in a constrained voice,

"you could have reached the picture without standing on the chair?" He

interrupted solely from a tremendous desire for speech. It would have

been impossible for him to remain silent. He had to speak or perish.
"I couldn't," Julian denied vehemently. "The picture's practically as

high as the top of the cupboard—or was."
"And could you see on to the top of the cupboard from a chair?"

Louis, with a peculiar gaze, was apparently estimating Julian's total

height from the ground when raised on a chair.
Julian dashed down the papers.
"Here! Come and look for yourself!" he exclaimed with furious

pugnacity. "Come and look." He jumped up and moved towards the door.
Rachel and Louis followed him obediently. In the back room it was he

who struck a match and lighted the gas.
"You've shifted the picture!" he cried, as soon as the room was

illuminated.
"Yes, we have," Louis admitted.
"But there's where it was!" Julian almost shouted, pointing. "You

can't deny it! There's the marks. Are they as high as the top of

the cupboard, or aren't they?" Then he dragged along a chair to the

cupboard and stood on it, puffing at his pipe. "Can I see on to the

top of the cupboard or can't I?" he demanded. Obviously he could see

on to the top of the cupboard.
"I didn't think the top was so low," said Louis.
"Well, you shouldn't contradict," Julian chastised him.
"It's just as your great-aunt said," put in Rachel, in a meditative

tone. "I remember she told us she pushed a chair forward with her

knee. I dare say in getting on to the chair she knocked her elbow or

something against the picture, and no doubt she left the chair more or

less where she'd pushed it. That would be it."
"Did she say that to you?" Louis questioned Rachel.
"It doesn't matter much what she said," Julian growled. "That's how

it was, anyway. I'm telling you. I'm not here to listen to

theories."
"Well," said Louis amiably, "you put the notes into your pocket. What

then?"
Julian removed his pipe from his mouth.
"What then? I walked off with 'em."
"But you don't mean to tell us you meant—to appropriate them, Julian?

You don't mean that!" Louis spoke reassuringly, good-naturedly, and

with a slight superiority.
"No, I don't. I don't mean I appropriated 'em." Julian's voice rose

defiantly. "I mean I stole them.... I stole them, and what's more,

I meant to steal them. And so there ye are! But come back to the

parlour. I must finish my reading."
He strode away into the parlour, and the other two had no alternative

but to follow him. They followed him like guilty things; for the

manner of his confession was such as apparently to put his hearers,

more than himself, in the wrong. He confessed as one who accuses.
"Sit down," said he, in the parlour.
"But surely," Louis protested, "if you're serious—"
"If I'm serious, man! Do you take me for a bally mountebank? Do you

suppose I'm doing this for fun?"
"Well," said Louis, "if you are serious, you needn't tell us

any more. We know, and that's enough, isn't it?"
Julian replied curtly, "You've got to hear me out."
And picking up his document from the floor, he resumed the perusal.
"'Also, if the gas hadn't been where it is, I should not have noticed

anything on the top of the cupboard. I took the notes because I was

badly in need of money, and also because I was angry at money being

left like that on the tops of cupboards. I had no idea Aunt Maldon was

such a foolish woman.'"
Louis interjected soothingly: "But you only meant to teach the old

lady a lesson and give the notes back."
"I didn't," said Julian, again extremely irritated. "Can't ye

understand plain English? I say I stole the money, and I meant to

steal it. Don't let me have to tell ye that any more. I'll go on: 'The

sight of the notes was too sore a temptation for me, and I yielded

to it. And all the more shame to me, for I had considered myself

an honest man up to that very hour. I never thought about the

consequences to my Aunt Maldon, nor how I was going to get rid of

the notes. I wanted money bad, and I took it. As soon as I'd left the

house I was stricken with remorse. I could not decide what to do. The

fact is I had no time to reflect until I was on the steamer, and

it was then too late. Upon arriving at Cape Town I found the cable

stating that Aunt Maldon was dead. I draw a veil over my state of

mind, which, however, does not concern you. I ought to have returned

to England at once, but I could not. I might have sent to Batchgrew

and told him to take half of four hundred and fifty pounds off my

share of Aunt Maldon's estate and put it into yours. But that would

not have helped my conscience. I had it on my conscience, as it might

have been on my stomach. I tried religion, but it was no good to me.

It was between a prayer-meeting and an experience-meeting at Durban

that I used part of the ill-gotten money. I had not touched it till

then. But two days later I got back the very note that I'd spent.

A prey to remorse, I wandered from town to town, trying to do

business.'"

III
Rachel stood up.
"Julian!"
It was the first time in her life that she had called him by his

Christian name.
"What?"
"Give me that." As he hesitated, she added, "I want it."
He handed her the written confession.
"I simply can't bear to hear you reading it," said Rachel

passionately. "All about a prey to remorse and so on and so on! Why

do you want to confess? Why couldn't you have paid back the money and

have done with it, instead of all this fuss?"
"I must finish it now I've begun," Julian insisted sullenly.
"You'll do no such thing—not in my house."
And, repeating pleasurably the phrase "not in my house," Rachel

stuck the confession into the fire, and feverishly forced it into the

red coals with lunges of the poker. When she turned away from the fire

she was flushing scarlet. Julian stood close by her on the hearth-rug.
"You don't understand," he said, with half-fearful resentment. "I had

to punish myself. I doubt I'm not a religious man, but I had to punish

myself. There's nobody in the world as I should hate confessing to as

much as Louis here, and so I said to myself, I said, 'I'll confess

to Louis.' I've been wandering about all the evening trying to bring

myself to do it.... Well, I've done it."
His voice trembled, and though the vibration in it was almost

imperceptible, it was sufficient to nullify the ridiculousness of

Julian's demeanour as a wearer of sackcloth, and to bring a sudden

lump into Rachel's throat. The comical absurdity of his bellicose

pride because he had accomplished something which he had sworn to

accomplish was extinguished by the absolutely painful sincerity of his

final words, which seemed somehow to damage the reputation of Louis.

Rachel could feel her emotion increasing, but she could not have

defined what her emotion was. She knew not what to do. She was in the

midst of a new and intense experience, which left her helpless. All

she was clearly conscious of was an unrepentant voice in her heart

repeating the phrase: "I don't care! I'm glad I stuck it in the fire!

I don't care! I'm glad I stuck it in the fire." She waited for the

next development. They were all waiting, aware that individual forces

had been loosed, but unable to divine their resultant, and afraid of

that resultant. Rachel glanced furtively at Louis. His face had an

uneasy, stiff smile.
With an aggrieved air Julian knocked the ashes out of his pipe.
"Anyhow," said Louis at length, "this accounts for four hundred and

fifty out of nine sixty-five. What we have to find out now, all of us,

is what happened to the balance."
"I don't care a fig about the balance," said Julian impetuously. "I've

said what I had to say and that's enough for me."
And he did not, in fact, care a fig about the balance. And if the

balance had been five thousand odd instead of five hundred odd, he

still probably would not have cared. Further, he privately considered

that nobody else ought to care about the balance, either, having

regard to the supreme moral importance to himself of the four hundred

and fifty.
"Have you said anything to Mr. Batchgrew?" Louis asked, trying to

adopt a casual tone, and to keep out of his voice the relief and joy

which were gradually taking possession of his soul. The upshot of

Julian's visit was so amazingly different from the apprehension of it

that he could have danced in his glee.
"Not I!" Julian answered ferociously. "The old robber has been writing

me, wanting me to put money into some cinema swindle or other. I gave

him a bit of my mind."
"He was trying the same here," said Rachel. The words popped by

themselves out of her mouth, and she instantly regretted them.

However, Louis seemed to be unconscious of the implied reproach on a

subject presumably still highly delicate.
"But you can tell him, if you've a mind," Julian went on

challengingly.
"We shan't do any such thing," said Rachel, words again popping by

themselves out of her mouth. But this time she put herself right by

adding, "Shall we, Louis?"
"Of course not," Louis agreed very amiably.
Rachel began to feel sympathetic towards the thief. She thought: "How

strange to have some one close to me, and talking quite naturally,

who has stolen such a lot of money and might be in prison for it—a

convict!" Nevertheless, the thief seemed to be remarkably like

ordinary people.
"Oh!" Julian ejaculated. "Well, here's the notes." He drew a lot of

notes from a pocket-book and banged them down on the table. "Four

hundred and fifty. The identical notes. Count 'em." He glared afresh,

and with even increased virulence.
"That's all right," said Louis. "That's all right. Besides, we only

want half of them."
Sundry sheets of the confession, which had not previously caught

fire, suddenly blazed up with a roar in the grate, and all looked

momentarily at the flare.
"You've got to have it all!" said Julian, flushing.
"My dear fellow," Louis repeated, "we shall only take half. The other

half's yours."
"As God sees me," Julian urged, "I'll never take a penny of that

money! Here—"
He snatched up all the notes and dashed wrathfully out of the parlour.

Rachel followed quickly. He went to the back room, where the gas had

been left burning high, sprang on to a chair in front of the cupboard,

and deposited the notes on the top of the cupboard, in the very place

from which he had originally taken them.
"There!" he exclaimed, jumping down from the chair. The symbolism of

the action appeared to tranquillize him.

IV
For a moment Rachel, as a newly constituted housewife to whom every

square foot of furniture surface had its own peculiar importance, was

enraged to see Julian's heavy and dirty boots again on the seat of her

unprotected chair. But the sense of hurt passed like a spasm as her

eyes caught Julian's. They were alone together in the back room and

not far from each other. And in the man's eyes she no longer saw

the savage Julian, but an intensely suffering creature, a creature

martyrized by destiny. She saw the real Julian glancing out in torment

at the world through those eyes. The effect of the vibration in

Julian's voice a few minutes earlier was redoubled. Her emotion nearly

overcame her. She desired very much to succour Julian, and was aware

of a more distinct feeling of impatience against Louis.
She thought Julian had been magnificently heroic, and all his faults

of demeanour were counted to him for excellences. He had been a thief;

but the significance of the word "thief" was indeed completely altered

for her. She had hitherto envisaged thieves as rascals in handcuffs

bandied along the streets by policemen at the head of a procession of

urchins—dreadful rascals! But now a thief was just a young man like

other young men—only he had happened to see some bank-notes lying

about and had put them in his pocket and then had felt very sorry

for what he had done. There was no crime in what he had done ... was

there? She pictured Julian's pilgrimage through South Africa, all

alone. She pictured his existence at Knype, all alone; and his very

ferocity rendered him the more wistful and pathetic in her sight. She

was sure that his mother and sisters had never understood him; and she

did not think it quite proper on their part to have gone permanently

to America, leaving him solitary in England, as they had done. She

perceived that she herself was the one person in the world capable

of understanding Julian, the one person who could look after him,

influence him, keep him straight, civilize him, and impart some charm

to his life. And she was glad that she had the status of a married

woman, because without that she would have been helpless.
Julian sat down, or sank, on to the chair.
"I'm very sorry I spoke like that to you in the other room—I mean

about what you'd written," she said. "I suppose I ought not to have

burnt it."
She spoke in this manner because to apologize to him gave her a

curious pleasure.
"That's nothing," he answered, with the quietness of fatigue. "I dare

say you were right enough. Anyhow, ye'll never see me again."
She exclaimed, kindly protesting—
"Why not, I should like to know?"
"You won't want me here as a visitor, after all this." He faintly

sneered.
"I shall," she insisted.
"Louis won't."
She replied: "You must come and see me. I shall expect you to. I must

tell you," she added confidentially, in a lower tone, "I think you've

been splendid to-night. I'm sure I respect you much more than I did

before—and you can take it how you like!"
"Nay! Nay!" he murmured deprecatingly. All the harshness had melted

out of his voice.
Then he stood up.
"I'd better hook it," he said briefly. "Will you get me my overcoat,

missis."
She comprehended that he wished to avoid speaking to Louis again that

night, and, nodding, went at once to the parlour and brought away the

overcoat.
"He's going," she muttered hastily to Louis, who was standing near the

fire. Leaving the parlour, she drew the door to behind her.
She helped Julian with his overcoat and preceded him to the front

door. She held out her hand to be tortured afresh, and suffered the

grip of the vice with a steady smile.
"Now don't forget," she whispered.
Julian seemed to try to speak and to fail.... He was gone. She

carefully closed and bolted the door.

V
Louis had not followed Julian and Rachel into the back room because

he felt the force of an instinct to be alone with his secret

satisfaction. In those moments it irked him to be observed, and

especially to be observed by Rachel, not to mention Julian. He was

glad for several reasons—on account of his relief, on account of the

windfall of money, and perhaps most of all on account of the discovery

that he was not the only thief in the family. The bizarre coincidence

which had divided the crime about equally between himself and Julian

amused him. His case and Julian's were on a level. Nevertheless, he

somewhat despised Julian, patronized him, condescended to him. He

could not help thinking that Julian was, after all, a greater sinner

than himself. Never again could Julian look him (Louis) in the face as

if nothing had happened. The blundering Julian was marked for life, by

his own violent, unreasonable hand. Julian was a fool.
Rachel entered rather solemnly.
"Has he really gone?" Louis asked. Rachel did not care for her

husband's tone, which was too frivolous for her. She was shocked to

find that Louis had not been profoundly impressed by the events of the

night.
"Yes," she said.
"What's he done with the money?"
"He's left it in the other room." She would not disclose to Louis that

Julian had restored the notes to the top of the cupboard, because she

was afraid that he might treat the symbolic act with levity.
"All of it?"
"Yes. I'll bring it you."
She did so. Louis counted the notes and casually put them in his

breast pocket.
"Oddest chap I ever came across!" he observed, smiling.
"But aren't you sorry for him?" Rachel demanded.
"Yes," said Louis airily. "I shall insist on his taking half,

naturally."
"I'm going to bed," said Rachel. "You'll see all the lights out."
She offered her face and kissed him tepidly.
"What's come over the kid?" Louis asked himself, somewhat

disconcerted, when she had gone.
He remained smoking, purposeless, in the parlour until all sounds had

ceased overhead in the bedroom. Then he extinguished the gas in the

parlour, in the back room, in the kitchen, and finally in the lobby,

and went upstairs by the light of the street lamp. In the bedroom

Rachel lay in bed, her eyes closed. She did not stir at his entrance.

He locked the bank-notes in a drawer of the dressing-table, undressed

with his usual elaborate care, approached Rachel's bed and gazed at

her unresponsive form, turned down the gas to a pinpoint, and got into

bed himself. Not the slightest sound could be heard anywhere, either

in or out of the house, save the faint breathing of Rachel. And after

a few moments Louis no longer heard even that. In the darkness the

mystery of the human being next him began somehow to be disquieting.

He was capable of imagining that he lay in the room with an utter

stranger. Then he fell asleep.

CHAPTER XII
RUNAWAY HORSES

I
Rachel, according to her own impression the next morning, had no sleep

during that night. The striking of the hall clock could not be heard

in the bedroom with the door closed, but it could be felt as a faint,

distinct concussion; and she had thus noted every hour, except four

o'clock, when daylight had come and the street lamp had been put out.

She had deliberately feigned sleep as Louis entered the room, and had

maintained the soft, regular breathing of a sleeper until long after

he was in bed. She did not wish to talk; she could not have talked

with any safety.
Her brain was occupied much by the strange and emotional episode of

Julian's confession, but still more by the situation of her husband in

the affair. Julian's story had precisely corroborated one part of Mrs.

Maldon's account of her actions on the evening when the bank-notes had

disappeared. Little by little that recital of Mrs. Maldon's had been

discredited, and at length cast aside as no more important than the

delirium of a dying creature; it was an inconvenient story, and would

only fit in with the alternative theories that money had wings and

could fly on its own account, or that there had been thieves in

the house. Far easier to assume that Mrs. Maldon in some lapse had

unwittingly done away with the notes! But Mrs. Maldon was now suddenly

reinstated as a witness. And if one part of her evidence was true, why

should not the other part be true? Her story was that she had put the

remainder of the bank-notes on the chair on the landing, and then (she

thought) in the wardrobe. Rachel recalled clearly all that she had

seen and all that she had been told. She remembered once more the

warnings that had been addressed to her. She lived the evening and

the night of the theft over again, many times, monotonously, and with

increasing woe and agitation.
Then with the greenish dawn, that the blinds let into the room, came

some refreshment and new health to the brain, but the trend of

her ideas was not modified. She lay on her side and watched the

unconscious Louis for immense periods, and occasionally tears

filled her eyes. The changes in her existence seemed so swift and so

tremendous as to transcend belief. Was it conceivable that only twelve

hours earlier she had been ecstatically happy? In twelve hours—in six

hours—she had aged twenty years, and she now saw the Rachel of

the reception and of the bicycle lesson as a young girl, touchingly

ingenuous, with no more notion of danger than a baby.
At six o'clock she arose. Already she had formed the habit of arising

before Louis, and had reconciled herself to the fact that Louis had to

be forced out of bed. Happily, his feet once on the floor, he became

immediately manageable. Already she was the conscience and time-keeper

of the house. She could dress herself noiselessly; in a week she had

perfected all her little devices for avoiding noise and saving time.

She finally left the room neat, prim, with lips set to a thousand

responsibilities. She had a peculiar sensation of tight elastic about

her eyes, but she felt no fatigue, and she did not yawn. Mrs. Tams,

who had just descended, found her taciturn and exacting. She would

have every household task performed precisely in her own way, without

compromise. And it appeared that the house, which had the air of being

in perfect order, was not in order at all, that indeed the processes

of organization had, in young Mrs. Fores' opinion, scarcely yet begun.

It appeared that there was no smallest part or corner of the house as

to which young Mrs. Fores had not got very definite ideas and plans.

The individuality of Mrs. Tams was to have scope nowhere. But after

all, this seemed quite natural to Mrs. Tams.
When Rachel went back to the bedroom, about 7.30, to get Louis by

ruthlessness and guile out of bed, she was surprised to discover that

he had already gone up to the bathroom. She guessed, with vague alarm,

from this symptom that he had a new and very powerful interest in

life. He came to breakfast at three minutes to eight, three minutes

before it was served. When she entered the parlour in the wake of

Mrs. Tams he kissed her with gay fervour. She permitted herself to be

kissed. Her unresponsiveness, though not marked, disconcerted him and

somewhat dashed his mood. Whereupon Rachel, by the reassurance of her

voice, set about to convince him that he had been mistaken in deeming

her unresponsive. So that he wavered between two moods.
As she sat behind the tray, amid the exquisite odours of fresh coffee

and Ted Malkin's bacon (for she had forgiven Miss Malkin), behaving

like a staid wife of old standing, she well knew that she was a

mystery for Louis. She was the source of his physical comfort, the

origin of the celestial change in his life which had caused him to

admit fully that to live in digs was "a rotten game"; but she was

also, that morning, a most sinister mystery. Her behaviour was

faultless. He could seize on no definite detail that should properly

disturb him; only she had woven a veil between herself and him. Still,

his liveliness scarcely abated.
"Do you know what I'm going to do this very day as ever is?" he asked.
"What is it?"
"I'm going to buy you a bike. I've had enough of that old crock I

borrowed for you. I shall return it and come back with a new 'un. And

I know the precise bike that I shall come back with. It's at Bostock's

at Hanbridge. They've just opened a new cycle department."
"Oh, Louis!" she protested.
His scheme for spending money on her flattered her. But nevertheless

it was a scheme for spending money. Two hundred and twenty-five

pounds had dropped into his lap, and he must needs begin instantly to

dissipate it. He could not keep it. That was Louis! She refused to

see that the purchase of a bicycle was the logical consequence of her

lessons. She desired to believe that by some miracle at some future

date she could possess a bicycle without a bicycle being bought—and

in the meantime was there not the borrowed machine?
Suddenly she yawned.
"Didn't you sleep well?" he demanded.
"Not very."
"Oh!"
She could almost see into the interior of his brain, where he was

persuading himself that fatigue alone was the explanation of her

peculiar demeanour, and rejoicing that the mystery was, after all,

neither a mystery nor sinister.
"I say," he began between two puffs of a cigarette after breakfast, "I

shall send back half of that money to Julian. I'll send the notes by

registered post."
"Shall you?"
"Yes. Don't you think he'll keep them?"
"Supposing I was to take them over to him myself—and insist?" she

suggested.
"It's a notion. When?"
"Well, on Saturday afternoon. He'll be at home probably then."
"All right," Louis agreed. "I'll give you the money later on."
Nothing more was said as to the Julian episode. It seemed that husband

and wife were equally determined not to discuss it merely for the sake

of discussing it.
Shortly after half-past eight Louis was preparing the borrowed bicycle

and his own in the back yard.
"I shall ride mine and tow the crock," said he, looking up at Rachel

as he screwed a valve. She had come into the yard in order to show a

polite curiosity in his doings.
"Isn't it dangerous?"
"Are you dangerous?" he laughed.
"But when shall you go?"
"Now."
"Shan't you be late at the works?"
"Well, if I'm late at the beautiful works I shall be late at the

beautiful works. Those who don't like it will have to lump it."
Once more, it was the consciousness of a loose, entirely available two

hundred and twenty-five pounds that was making him restive under the

yoke of regular employment. For a row of pins, that morning, he would

have given Jim Horrocleave a week's notice, or even the amount of a

week's wages in lieu of notice! Rachel sighed, but within herself.
In another minute he was elegantly flying down Bycars Lane, guiding

his own bicycle with his right hand and the crock with his left

hand. The feat appeared miraculous to Rachel, who watched from the

bow-window of the parlour. Beyond question he made a fine figure. And

it was for her that he was flying to Hanbridge! She turned away to her

domesticity.

II
It seemed to her that he had scarcely been gone ten minutes when one

of the glorious taxicabs which had recently usurped the stand of the

historic fly under the Town Hall porch drew up at the front door, and

Louis got out of it. The sound of his voice was the first intimation

to Rachel that it was Louis who was arriving. He shouted at the

cabman as he paid the fare. The window of the parlour was open and the

curtains pinned up. She ran to the window, and immediately saw that

Louis' head was bandaged. Then she ran to the door. He was climbing

rather stiffly up the steps.
"All right! All right!" he shouted at her. "A spill. Nothing of the

least importance. But both the jiggers are pretty well converted into

old iron. I tell you it's all right! Shut the door."
He bumped down on the oak chest, and took a long breath.
"But you are frightfully hurt!" she exclaimed. She could not properly

see his face for the bandages.
Mrs. Tams appeared. Rachel murmured to her in a flash—
"Go out the back way and fetch Dr. Yardley at once."
She felt herself absolutely calm. What puzzled her was Louis'

shouting. Then she understood he was shouting from mere excitement and

did not realize that he shouted.
"No need for any doctor! Quite simple!" he called out.
But Rachel gave a word confirming the original order to Mrs. Tams, who

disappeared.
"First thing I knew I was the centre of an admiring audience, and fat

Mrs. Heath, in her white apron and the steel hanging by her side, was

washing my face with a sponge and a basin of water, and Heath stood by

with brandy. It was nearly opposite their shop. People in the tram had

a rare view of me."
"But was it the tram-car you ran into?" Rachel asked eagerly.
He replied with momentary annoyance—
"Tram-car! Of course it wasn't the tram-car. Moreover, I didn't run

into anything. Two horses ran into me. I was coming down past the

Shambles into Duck Bank—very slowly, because I could hear a tram

coming along from the market-place—and just as I got past the

Shambles and could see along the market-place, I saw a lad on a

cart-horse and leading another horse. No stirrups, no saddle. He'd no

more control over either horse than a baby over an elephant. Not a bit

more. Both horses were running away. The horse he was supposed to

be leading was galloping first. They were passing the tram at a fine

rate."
"But how far were they off you?"
"About ten yards. I said to myself, 'If that chap doesn't look out

he'll be all over me in two seconds.' I turned as sharp as I could

away to the left. I could have turned sharper if I'd had your bicycle

in my right hand instead of my left. But it wouldn't have made any

difference. The first horse simply made straight for me. There was

about a mile of space for him between me and the tram, but he wouldn't

look at it. He wanted me, and he had me. They both had me. I never

felt the actual shock. Curious, that! I'm told one horse put his foot

clean through the back wheel of my bike. Then he was stopped by the

front palings of the Conservative Club. Oh! a pretty smash! The other

horse and the boy thereon finished half-way up Moorthorne Road. He

could stick on, no mistake, that kid could. Midland Railway horses.

Whoppers. Either being taken to the vets' or brought from the

vet's—I don't know. I forget."
Rachel put her hand on his arm.
"Do come into the parlour and have the easy-chair."
"I'll come—I'll come," he said, with the same annoyance. "Give us a

chance." His voice was now a little less noisy.
"But you might have been killed!"
"You bet I might! Eight hoofs all over me! One tap from any of the

eight would have settled yours sincerely."
"Louis!" She spoke firmly. "You must come into the parlour. Now come

along, do, and sit down and let me look at your face." She removed his

hat, which was perched rather insecurely on the top of the bandages.

"Who was it looked after you?"
"Well," he hesitated, following her into the parlour, "it seems to

have been chiefly Mrs. Heath."
"But didn't they take you to a chemist's? Isn't there a chemist's

handy?"
"The great Greene had one of his bilious attacks and was in bed,

it appears. And the great Greene's assistant is only just out of

petticoats, I believe. However, everybody acted for the best, and here

I am. And if you ask me, I think I've come out of it rather well."
He dropped heavily on to the Chesterfield. What she could see of his

cheeks was very pale.
"Open the window," he murmured. "It's frightfully stuffy here."
"The window is open," she said. In fact, a noticeable draught blew

through the room. "I'll open it a bit more."
Before doing so she lifted his feet on to the Chesterfield.
"That's better. That's better," he breathed.
When, a moment later, she returned to him with a glass of water which

she had brought from the kitchen, spilling drops of it along the whole

length of the passage, he smiled at her and then winked.
It was the wink that seemed pathetic to her. She had maintained her

laudable calm until he winked, and then her throat tightened.
"He may have some dreadful internal injury," she thought. "You never

know. I may be a widow soon. And every one will say, 'How young she is

to be a widow!' It will make me blush. But such things can't happen to

me. No, he's all right. He came up here alone. They'd never have let

him come up here alone if he hadn't been all right. Besides, he can

walk. How silly I am!"
She bent down and kissed him passionately.
"I must have those bandages off, dearest," she whispered. "I suppose

to-morrow I'd better return them to Mrs. Heath."
He muttered: "She said she always kept linen for bandages in the

shop because they so often cut themselves. Now, I used to think in my

innocence that butchers never cut themselves."
Very gently and intently Rachel unfastened two safety-pins that were

hidden in Louis' untidy hair. Then she began to unwind a long strip

of linen. It stuck to a portion of the cheek close to the ear. Louis

winced. The inner folds of the linen were discoloured. Rachel had a

glimpse of a wound....
"Go on!" Louis urged. "Get at it, child!"
"No," she said. "I think I shall leave it just as it is for the doctor

to deal with. Shall you mind if I leave you for a minute? I must get

some warm water and things ready against the doctor comes."
He retorted facetiously: "Oh! Do what you like! Work your will on

me.... Doctor! Any one 'ud think I was badly injured. Why, you cuckoo,

it's only skin wounds!"
"But doesn't it hurt?"
"Depends what you call hurt. It ain't a picnic."
"I think you're awfully brave," she said simply.
At the door she stopped and gazed at him, undecided.
"Louis," she said in a motherly tone, "I should like you to go to bed.

I really should. You ought to, I'm sure."
"Well, I shan't," he replied.
"But please! To please me! You can get up again."
"Oh, go to blazes!" he cried resentfully. "What in thunder should I go

to bed for, I should like to know? Have a little sense, do!" He shut

his eyes.
He had never till then spoken to her so roughly.
"Very well," she agreed, with soothing acquiescence. His outburst had

not irritated her in the slightest degree.
In the kitchen, as she bent over the kettle and the fire, each object

was surrounded by a sort of halo, like the moon in damp weather. She

brushed her hand across her eyes, contemptuous of herself. Then she

ran lightly upstairs and searched out an old linen garment and tore

the seams of it apart. She crept back to the parlour and peeped in.

Louis had not moved on the sofa. His eyes were still closed. After a

few seconds, he said, without stirring—
"I've not yet passed away. I can see you."
She responded with a little laugh, somewhat forced.
After an insupportable delay Mrs. Tams reappeared, out of breath.

Dr. Yardley had just gone out, but he was expected back very soon and

would then be sent down instantly.
Mrs. Tams, quite forgetful of etiquette, followed Rachel, unasked,

into the parlour.
"What?" said Louis loudly. "Two of you! Isn't one enough?"
Mrs. Tams vanished.
"Heath took charge of the bikes," Louis murmured, as if to the

ceiling.
Over half an hour elapsed before the gate creaked.
"There he is!" Rachel exclaimed happily. After having conceived a

hundred different tragic sequels to the accident, she was lifted by

the mere creak of the gate into a condition of pure optimism, and

she realized what a capacity she had for secretly being a ninny in an

unexpected crisis. But she thought with satisfaction: "Anyhow, I don't

show it. That's one good thing!" She was now prepared to take oath

that she had not for one moment been really anxious about

Louis. Her demeanour, as she stated the case to the doctor, was a

masterpiece of tranquil unconcern.

III
Dr. Yardley said that he was in a hurry—that, in fact, he ought to

have been quite elsewhere at the time. He was preoccupied, and showed

no sympathy with the innocent cyclist who had escaped the fatal

menace of hoofs. When Rachel offered him the torn linen, he silently

disdained it, and, opening a small bag which he had brought with

him, produced therefrom a roll of cotton-wool in blue paper, and

a considerable quantity of sticking-plaster on a brass reel. He

accepted, however, Rachel's warm water.
"You might get me some Condy's Fluid," he said shortly.
She had none! It was a terrible lapse for a capable housewife.
Dr. Yardley raised his eyebrows: "No Condy's Fluid in the house!"
She was condemned.
"I do happen to have a couple of tablets of Chinosol," he said, "but I

wanted to keep them in reserve for later in the day."
He threw two yellow tablets into the basin of water.
Then he laid Louis flat on the sofa, asked him a few questions, and

sounded him in various parts. And at length he slowly, but firmly,

drew off Mrs. Heath's bandages, and displayed Louis' head to the

light.
"Hm!" he exclaimed.
Rachel restrained herself from any sound. But the spectacle was

ghastly. The one particle of comfort in the dreadful matter was that

Louis could not see himself.
Thenceforward Dr. Yardley seemed to forget that he ought to have been

elsewhere. Working with extraordinary deliberation, he coaxed out

of Louis' flesh sundry tiny stones and many fragments of mud,

straightened twisted bits of skin, and he removed other pieces

entirely. He murmured, "Hm!" at intervals. He expressed a brief

criticism of the performance of Mrs. Heath, as distinguished from her

intentions. He also opined that the great Greene might not perhaps

have succeeded much better than Mrs. Heath, even if he had not been

bilious. When the dressing was finished, the gruesome terror of Louis'

appearance seemed to be much increased. The heroic sufferer rose and

glanced at himself in the mirror, and gave a faint whistle.
"Oh! So that's what I look like, is it? Well, what price me as a

victim of the Inquisition!" he remarked.
"I should advise you not to take exercise just now, young man," said

the doctor. "D'you feel pretty well?"
"Pretty well," answered Louis, and sat down.
In the lobby the doctor, once more in a hurry, said to Rachel—
"Better get him quietly to bed. The wounds are not serious, but he's

had a very severe shock."
"He's not marked for life, is he?" Rachel asked anxiously.
"I shouldn't think so," said the doctor, as if the point was a minor

one. "Let him have some nourishment. You can begin with hot milk—but

put some water to it," he added when he was half-way down the steps.
As Rachel re-entered the parlour she said to herself: "I shall just

have to get him to bed somehow, whatever he says! If he's unpleasant

he must be unpleasant, that's all."
And she hardened her heart. But immediately she saw him again, sitting

forlornly in the chair, with the whole of the left side of his face

criss-crossed in whitish-grey plaster, she was ready to cry over him

and flatter his foolishest whim. She wanted to take him in her arms,

if he would but have allowed her. She felt that she could have borne

his weight for hours without moving, had he fallen asleep against her

bosom.... Still, he must be got to bed. How negligent of the doctor

not to have given the order himself!
Then Louis said: "I say! I think I may as well lie down!"
She was about to cry out, "Oh, you must!"
But she forbore. She became as wily as old Batchgrew.
"Do you think so?" she answered, doubtfully.
"I've nothing else particular on hand," he said.
She knew that he wanted to surrender without appearing to surrender.
"Well," she suggested, "will you lie down on the bed for a bit?"
"I think I will."
"And then I'll give you some hot milk."
She dared not help him to mount the stairs, but she walked close

behind him.
"I was thinking," he said on the landing, "I'd stroll down and take

stock of those bicycles later in the day. But perhaps I'm not fit to

be seen."
She thought: "You won't stroll down later in the day—I shall see to

that."
"By the way," he said, "you might send Mrs. Tams down to Horrocleave's

to explain that I shan't give them my valuable assistance to-day....

Oh! Mrs. Tams"—the woman was just bustling out of the bedroom, duster

in hand—"will you toddle down to the works and tell them I'm not

coming?"
"Eh, mester!" breathed Mrs. Tams, looking at him. "It's a mercy it's

no worse."
"Yes," Louis teased her, "but you go and look at the basin downstairs,

Mrs. Tams. That'll give you food for thought."
Shaking her head, she smiled at Rachel, because the master had spirit

enough to be humorous with her.
In the bedroom, Louis said, "I might be more comfortable if I took

some of my clothes off."
Thereupon he abandoned himself to Rachel. She did as she pleased with

him, and he never opposed. Seven bruises could be counted on his left

side. He permitted himself to be formally and completely put to bed.

He drank half a glass of hot milk, and then said that he could not

possibly swallow any more. Everything had been done that ought to be

done and that could be done. And Rachel kept assuring herself that

there was not the least cause for anxiety. She also told herself that

she had been a ninny once that morning, and that once was enough.

Nevertheless, she remained apprehensive, and her apprehensions

increased. It was Louis' unnatural manageableness that disturbed her.
And when, about three hours later, he murmured, "Old girl, I feel

pretty bad."
"I knew it," she said to herself.
His complaint was like a sudden thunderclap in her ears, after long

faint rumblings of a storm.
Towards tea-time she decided that she must send for the doctor again.

Louis indeed demanded the doctor. He said that he was very ill. His

bruised limbs and his damaged face caused him a certain amount of

pain. It was not, however, the pain that frightened him, but a general

and profound sensation of illness. He could describe no symptoms.

There were indeed no symptoms save the ebbing of vitality. He said he

had never in his life felt as he felt then. His appearance confirmed

the statement. The look of his eyes was tragic. His hands were

pale. His agonized voice was extremely distressing to listen to. The

bandages heightened the whole sinister effect. Dusk shadowed the room.

Rachel lit the gas and drew the blinds. But in a few moments Louis

complained of the light, and she had to lower the jet.
The sounds of the return of Mrs. Tams could be heard below. Mrs.

Tams had received instructions to bring the doctor back with her, but

Rachel's ear caught no sign of the doctor. She went out to the head

of the stairs. The doctor simply must be there. It was not conceivable

that when summoned he should be "out" twice in one day, but so it was.

Mrs. Tams, whispering darkly from the dim foot of the stairs, said

that Mrs. Yardley hoped that he would be in shortly, but could not be

sure.
"What am I to do?" thought Rachel. "This is a crisis. Everything

depends on me. What shall I do? Shall I send for another doctor?" She

decided to risk the chances and wait. It would be too absurd to have

two doctors in the house. What would people say of her and of Louis,

if the rumour ran that she had lost her head and filled the house with

doctors when the case had no real gravity? People would say that she

was very young and inexperienced, and a freshly married wife, and so

on. And Rachel hated to be thought young or freshly married. Besides,

another doctor might be "out" too. And further, the case could not be

truly serious. Of course, if afterwards it did prove to be serious,

she would never forgive herself.
"He'll be here soon," she said cheerfully, to Louis in the bedroom.
"If he isn't—" moaned Louis, and stopped.
She gave him some brandy, against his will. Then, taking his wrist to

feel it, she felt his fingers close on her wrist, as if for aid. And

she sat thus on the bed holding his hand in the gloom of the lowered

gas.

IV
His weakness and his dependence on her gave her a feeling of kind

superiority. And also her own physical well-being was such that she

could not help condescending towards him. She cared for a trustful,

helpless little dog. She thought a great deal about him; she longed

ardently to be of assistance to him; she had an acute sense of her

responsibility and her duty. Yet, notwithstanding all that, her brain

was perhaps chiefly occupied with herself and her own attitude towards

existence. She became mentally and imaginatively active to an intense

degree. She marvelled at existence as she had never marvelled before,

and while seeming suddenly to understand it better she was far more

than ever baffled by it. Was it credible that the accident of a lad

losing control of a horse could have such huge and awful consequences

on two persons utterly unconnected with the lad? A few seconds sooner,

a few seconds later—and naught would have occurred to Louis, but he

must needs be at exactly a certain spot at exactly a certain instant,

with the result that now she was in torture! If this, if that, if the

other—Louis would have been well and gay at that very moment, instead

of a broken organism humiliated on a bed and clinging to her like a

despairing child.
The rapidity and variety of events in her life again startled her, and

once more she went over them. The disappearance of the bank-notes was

surely enough in itself. But on the top of that fell the miracle of

her love affair. Her marriage was like a dream of romance to her,

untrue, incredible. Then there was the terrific episode of Julian

on the previous night. One would have supposed that after that the

sensationalism of events would cease. But, no! The unforeseeable had

now occurred, something which reduced all else to mere triviality.
And yet what had in fact occurred? Acquaintances, in recounting her

story, would say that she had married her mistress's nephew, that

there had been trouble between Louis and Julian about some bank-notes,

and that Louis had had a bicycle accident. Naught more! A most

ordinary chronicle! And if he died now, they would say that Louis

had died within a month of the wedding and how sad it was! Husbands

indubitably do die, young wives indubitably are transformed into

widows—daily event, indeed!... She seemed to perceive the deep,

hidden meaning of life. There were three Rachels in her—one who

pitied Louis, one who pitied herself, and one who looked on and

impartially comprehended. The last was scarcely unhappy—only

fervently absorbed in the prodigious wonder of the hour.
"Can't you do anything?" Louis murmured.
"If Dr. Yardley doesn't come quick, I shall send for some other

doctor," she said, with decision.
He sighed.
"Better send for a lawyer at the same time," he said.
"A lawyer?"
"Yes. You know I've not made my will."
"Oh, Louis! Please don't talk like that! I can't bear to hear you."
"You'll have to hear worse things than that," he said pettishly,

loosing her hand. "I've got to have a solicitor here. Later on you'll

probably be only too glad that I had enough common sense to send for

a solicitor. Somebody must have a little common sense. I expect you'd

better send for Lawton.... Oh! It's Friday afternoon—he'll have left

early for his week-end golf, I bet." This last discovery seemed to

exhaust his courage.
In another minute the doctor, cheerful and energetic, was actually in

the room, and the gas brilliant. He gazed at an exanimate Louis, made

a few inquiries and a few observations of his own, gave some brief

instructions, and departed. The day was in truth one of his busy days.
He seemed surprised when Rachel softly called to him on the stairs.
"I suppose everything's all right, doctor?"
"Yes," said he casually. "He'll feel mighty queer for a few days.

That's all."
"Then there's no danger?"
"Certainly not."
"But he thinks he's dying."
Dr. Yardley smiled carelessly.
"And do you?... He's no more dying than I am. That's only the effect

of the shock. Didn't I tell you this morning? You probably won't be

able to stop him just yet from thinking he's dying—it is a horrid

feeling—but you needn't think so yourself, Mrs. Fores." He smiled.
"Oh, doctor," she burst out, "you don't know how you've relieved me!"
"You'll excuse me if I fly away," said Dr. Yardley calmly. "There's a

crowd of insurance patients waiting for me at the surgery."

V
In the middle of the night Rachel was awakened by Louis' appeal. She

was so profoundly asleep that for a few moments she could not recall

what it was that had happened during the previous day to cause her

anxiety.
After the visit of the doctor, Louis' moral condition had apparently

improved. He had affected to be displeased by the doctor's air of

treating his case as though it was deprived of all importance. He

had said that the doctor had failed to grasp his case. He had stated

broadly that in these days of State health insurance all doctors

were too busy and too wealthy to be of assistance to private patients

capable of paying their bills in the old gentlemanly fashion. But his

remarks had not been without a touch of facetiousness in their wilful

disgust. And the mere tone of his voice proved that he felt better. To

justify his previous black pessimism he had of course been obliged to

behave in a certain manner (well known among patients who have been

taking themselves too seriously), and Rachel had understood and

excused. She would have been ready, indeed, to excuse for worse

extravagances than any that could have occurred to the fancy of a

nature so polite and benevolent as that of Louis; for, in order to

atone for her silly school-girlishness, she had made a compact with

herself to be an angel and a serpent simultaneously for the entire

remainder of her married life.
Then Mrs. Tams had come in, from errands of marketing, with a copy of

the early special of the Signal, containing a description of

the accident. Mrs. Tams had never before bought such a thing as a

newspaper, but an acquaintance of hers who "stood the market" with

tripe and chitterlings had told her that Mr. Fores was "in" the

Signal, and accordingly she had bravely stopped a news-boy

in the street and made the purchase. To Rachel she pointed out the

paragraph with pride, and to please her and divert Louis, Rachel

had introduced the newspaper into the bedroom. The item was headed:

"Runaway Horses in Bursley Market-place. Providential Escape." It

spoke of Mr. Louis Fores' remarkable skill and presence of mind in

swerving away with two bicycles. It said that Mr. Louis Fores was an

accomplished cyclist, and that after a severe shaking Mr. Louis Fores

drove home in a taxicab "apparently little the worse, save for facial

contusions, for his perilous adventure." Lastly, it said that a

representative of the Midland Railway had "assured our representative

that the horses were not the property of the Midland Railway." Louis

had sardonically repeated the phrase "apparently little the worse,"

murmuring it with his eyes shut. He had said, "I wish they could see

me." Still, he had made no further mention of sending for a solicitor.

He had taken a little food and a little drink. He had asked Rachel

when she meant to go to bed. And at length Rachel, having first

arranged food for use in the night, and fixed a sheet of note-paper on

the gas-bracket as a screen between the gas and Louis, had undressed

and got into bed, and gone off into a heavy slumber with a mind

comparatively free.
In response to his confusing summons, she stumbled to her peignoir and

slipped it on.
"Yes, dear?" she spoke softly.
"I couldn't bear it any longer," said the voice of Louis. "I just had

to waken you."
She raised the gas, and her eyes blinked as she stared at him. His

bedclothes were horribly disarranged.
"Are you in pain?" she asked, smoothing the blankets.
"No. But I'm so ill. I—I don't want to frighten you—"
"The doctor said you'd feel ill. It's the shock, you know."
She stroked his hand. He did indubitably look very ill. His appearance

of woe, despair, and dreadful apprehension was pitiable in the highest

degree. With a gesture of intense weariness he declined food, nor

could she persuade him to take anything whatever.
"You'll be ever so much better to-morrow. I'll sit up with you. You

were bound to feel worse in the night."
"It's more than shock that I've got," he muttered. "I say, Rachel,

it's all up with me. I know I'm done for. You'll have to do the

best you can."
The notion shot through her head that possibly, after all, the doctor

might have misjudged the case. Suppose Louis were to die in the night?

Suppose the morning found her a widow? The world was full of the

strangest happenings.... Then she was herself again and immovably

cheerful in her secret heart. She thought: "I can go through worse

nights than this. One night, some time in the future, either he will

really be dying or I shall. This night is nothing." And she held his

hand and sat in her old place on his bed. The room was chilly. She

decided that in five minutes she would light the gas-stove, and also

make some tea with the spirit-lamp. She would have tea whether he

still refused or not. His watch on the night-table showed half-past

two. In about an hour the dawn would be commencing. She felt that she

had reserves of force against any contingency, against any nervous

strain.
Then he said, "I say, Rachel."
He was too ill to call her "Louise."
"I shall make some tea soon," she answered.
He went on: "You remember about that missing money—I mean before

auntie died. You remember—"
"Don't talk about that, dear," she interrupted him eagerly. "Why

should you bother about that now?"
In one instant those apparently exhaustless reserves of moral force

seemed to have ebbed away. She had imagined herself equal to any

contingency, and now there loomed a contingency which made her quail.
"I've got to talk about that," he said in his weak and desperate

voice. His bruised head was hollowed into the pillow, and he stared

monotonously at the ceiling, upon which the paper screen of the gas

threw a great trembling shadow. "That's why I wakened you. You don't

know what the inside of my brain's like.... Why did you say to them

you found the scullery door open that night? You know perfectly well

it wasn't open."
She could scarcely speak.
"I—I—Louis don't talk about that now. You're too ill," she implored.
"I know why you said it."
"Be quiet!" she said sharply, and her voice broke.
But he continued in the same tone—
"You made up that tale about the scullery door because you guessed

I'd collared the money and you wanted to save me from being suspected.

Well, I did collar the money! Now I've told you!"
She burst into a sob, and her head dropped on to his body.
"Louis!" she cried passionately, amid her sobs. "Why ever did you tell

me? You've ruined everything now. Everything!"
"I can't help that," said Louis, with a sort of obstinate and defiant

weariness. "It was on my mind, and I just had to tell you. You don't

seem to understand that I'm dying."
Rachel jumped up and sprang away from the bed.
"Of course you're not dying!" she reproached him. "How can you imagine

such things?"
Her heart suddenly hardened against him—against his white-bandaged

head and face, against his feeble voice of a beaten martyr. It seemed

to her disgraceful that he, a strong male creature, should be lying

there damaged, helpless, and under the foolish delusion that he was

dying. She recalled with bitter gusto the tone in which the doctor had

said, "He's no more dying than I am!" All her fears that the doctor

might be wrong had vanished away. She now resented her husband's

illness; as a nurse, when danger is over, will resent a patient's long

convalescence, somehow charging it to him as a sin.
"I found the other half of the notes under the chair on the—" Louis

began again.
"Please!" she objected with quick resounding violence, and raised a

hand.
He said—
"You must listen."
She answered, passionately—
"I won't listen! I won't listen! And if you don't stop I shall leave

the room! I shall leave you all alone!... Yes, I shall!" She moved a

little towards the door.
His gloomy and shifty glance followed her, and there was a short

silence.
"You needn't work yourself up into such a state," murmured Louis at

length. "But I should like to know whether the scullery door

was open or not, when you came downstairs that night?"
Rachel's glance fell. She blushed. The tears had ceased to drop from

her eyes. She made no answer.
"You see," said Louis, with a half-sneering triumph, "I knew jolly

well it wasn't open. So did old Batchgrew know, too."
She shut her lips together, went decisively to the mantelpiece, struck

a match, and lit the stove. Like the patent gas-burner downstairs,

the stove often had to be extinguished after the first lighting and

lighted again with a second and different kind of explosion. And so

it was now. She flung down the match pettishly into the hearth.

Throughout the whole operation she sniffed convulsively, to prevent a

new fit of sobbing. Her peignoir being very near to the purple-green

flames that folded themselves round the asbestos of the stove, she

reflected that the material was probably inflammable, and that a

careless movement might cause it to be ignited. "And not a bad thing,

either!" she said to herself. Then, without looking at all towards

the bed, she lit the spirit-lamp in order to make tea. The sniffing

continued, as she went through the familiar procedure.
The water would not boil, demonstrating the cruel truth of proverbs.

She sat down and, gazing into the stove, now a rich red, ignored the

saucepan. The dry heat from the stove burnt her ankles and face. Not

a sound from the small saucepan, balanced on its tripod over the

wavering blue flame of the spirit-lamp! At last, uncontrollably

impatient, she lifted the teapot off the inverted lid of the saucepan,

where she had placed it to warm, and peered into the saucepan. The

water was cheerfully boiling! She made the tea, and sat down again to

wait until it should be infused. She had to judge the minutes as well

as she could, for she would not go across to the night-table to look

at Louis' watch; her own was out of order, and so was the clock. She

counted two hundred and fifty, and then, anticipating feverishly

the tonic glow of the tea in her breast, she poured out a cup. Only

colourless steaming water came forth from the pot. She had forgotten

to put in the tea! Misfortune not unfamiliar to dazed makers of tea in

the night! But to Rachel now the consequences of the omission seemed

to amount to a tragedy. Had she the courage to begin the interminable

weary process afresh? She was bound to begin it afresh. With her

eyes obscured by tears, she put the water back into the saucepan and

searched for the match-box. The water boiled almost immediately, and

by so doing comforted her.
While waiting for the infusion, she realized little by little that for

a few moments she must have been nearly hysterical, and she partially

resumed possession of herself. The sniffing ceased, her vision

cleared; she grew sardonic. All her chest was filled with cold lead.

"This truly is the end," she thought. She had thought that Julian's

confession must be the end of the violent experiences which had

befallen her in Mrs. Malden's house. Then she had thought that Louis'

accident must be the end. Each time she had been mistaken. But she

could not be mistaken now. No conceivable event, however awful,

could cap Louis' confession that he had thieved—and under such

circumstances!
She did not drink the first cup of tea. No! She must needs carry it,

spilling it, to Louis in bed. He was asleep, or he was in a condition

that resembled sleep. Assuredly he was ill. He made a dreadful object

in his bandages amid the disorder of the bed, upon which strong

shadows fell from the gas and from the stove. No matter! If he was

ill, he was ill. So much the worse for him! He was not dangerously

ill. He was merely passing through a stress which had to be passed

through. It would soon be over, and he would be the same eternal Louis

that he had always been.
"Here!" she said.
He stirred, opened his eyes.
"Here's some tea!" she said coldly. "Drink it."
He gave a gesture of dissent. But it was useless. She had brewed the

tea and had determined that he should drink a cup. Whether he desired

it or loathed it was a question irrelevant. He was appointed to

drink some tea, and she would not taste until he had drunk. This

self-sacrifice was her perverse pleasure.
"Come!... Please don't make it any more awkward for me."
With her right arm she raised the pillow and his head on it. He drank,

his sick lips curling awkwardly upon the rim of the cup, which

she held for him. When he had drunk, she put the cup down on the

night-table, and tidied his bed, as though he had been a naughty

child. And then she left him, and drank tea slowly, savouringly, by

herself in a chair near the dressing-table, out of the same cup.

VI
She had lied about the scullery door being open when she went

downstairs on the night of the disappearance of the bank-notes.

The scullery door had not been open. The lie was clumsy, futile,

ill-considered. It had burst out of the impulsiveness and generosity

of her nature. She had perceived that suspicion was falling, or might

fall, upon Louis Fores, and the sudden lie had flashed forth to defend

him. That she could ultimately be charged with having told the lie in

order to screen herself from suspicion had never once occurred to her.

And it did not even occur to her now as she sat perched uncomfortably

on the chair in the night of desolation. She was now deeply ashamed

of the lie—and she ought not to have been ashamed, for it was a lie

magnanimous and fine; she might rather have taken pride in it. She was

especially ashamed of her repetition of the lie on the following day

to Thomas Batchgrew, and of her ingenious embroidery upon it. She

hated to remember that she had wept violently in front of Thomas

Batchgrew when he had charged her with having a secret about the loss

of the notes. He must have well known that she was lying; he must

have suspected her of some complicity; and if later he had affected to

ignore all the awkward aspects of the episode it was only because he

wished to remain on good terms with Louis for his own ends.
Had she herself all the time suspected Louis? In the harsh realism

of the night hours she was not able positively to assert that she

had never suspected him until after Julian's confession had made her

think; but, on the other hand, she would not directly accuse herself

of having previously suspected him. The worst that she could say was

that she had been determined to believe him guiltless. She loved him;

she had wanted his love; she would permit nothing to prevent their

coming together; and so in her mind she had established his innocence

apparently beyond any overthrowing. She might have allowed herself

to surmise that in the early past he had been naughty, untrustworthy,

even wicked—but that was different, that did not concern her. His

innocence with regard to the bank-notes alone mattered. And she had

been genuinely convinced of it. A few moments before he kissed her for

the first time, she had been genuinely convinced of it. And after the

betrothal her conviction became permanent. She tried to scorn now the

passion which had blinded her. Mrs. Maldon, at any rate, must have

known that he was connected with the disappearance of the notes. In

the light of Louis' confession Rachel could see all that Mrs. Maldon

was implying in that last conversation between them.
So that she might win him she had been ready to throttle every doubt

of his honesty. But now the indubitable fact that he was a thief

seemed utterly monstrous and insupportable. And, moreover, his crime

was exceptionally cruel. Was it conceivable that he could so lightly

cause so much distress of spirit to a woman so aged, defenceless, and

kind? According to the doctor, the shock of the robbery had not been

the originating cause of Mrs. Maldon's death; but it might have been;

quite possibly it had hastened death.... Louis was not merely a thief;

he was a dastardly thief.
But even that in her eyes did not touch the full height of his

offence. The vilest quality in him was his capacity to seem innocent.

She could recall the exact tone in which he had exclaimed: "Would

you believe that old Batch practically accused me of stealing the

old lady's money?... Don't you think it's a shame?" The recollection

filled her with frigid anger. Her resentment of the long lie which he

had lived in her presence since their betrothal was tremendous in its

calm acrimony. A man who could behave as he had behaved would stop at

nothing, would be capable of all.
She contrasted his conduct with the grim candour of Julian Maldon,

whom she now admired. It was strange and dreadful that both the

cousins should be thieves; the prevalence of thieves in that family

gave her a shudder. But she could not judge Julian Maldon severely.

He did not appear to her as a real thief. He had committed merely an

indiscretion. It was his atonement that made her admire him. Though

she hated confessions, though she had burnt his exasperating document,

she nevertheless liked the manner of his atonement. Whereas she

contemned Louis for having confessed.
"He thought he was dying and so he confessed!" she reflected with

asperity. "He hadn't even the pluck to go through with what he had

begun.... Ah! If I had committed a crime and once denied it, I would

deny it with my last breath, and no torture should drag it out of me!"
And she thought: "I am punished. This is my punishment for letting

myself be engaged while Mrs. Maldon was dying."
Often she had dismissed as childish the notion that she was to blame

for accepting Louis just when she did. But now it returned full of

power and overwhelmed her. And like a whipped child she remembered

Mrs. Maldon's warning: "My nephew is not to be trusted. The woman

who married him would suffer horribly." And she was the woman who had

married him. It seemed to her that the warnings of the dying must of

necessity prove to be valid.
Some mysterious phenomenon on the window-blind at her right hand

attracted her attention, and she looked round, half startled. It was

the dawn, furtive and inexorable. She had watched dawns, and she had

watched them in that very bedroom. Only on the previous morning the

dawn had met her smarting and wakeful eyes, and she had imagined that

no dawn could be more profoundly sad!... And a little earlier still

she had been desolating herself for hours because Louis was going to

be careless about his investments, because he was unreliable and she

would have to watch ceaselessly over his folly. She had imagined then

that no greater catastrophe could overtake her than some material

result of his folly!... What a trivial apprehension! What a child she

had been!
In the excitement and alarm of his accident she had honestly forgotten

her suspicions of him. That disconcerted her.
She rose from the chair, stiff. The stove, with its steady faint

roar of imperfectly consumed gas, had thoroughly heated the room. In

careful silence she put the tea-things together. Then she ventured to

glance at Louis. He was asleep. He had been restlessly asleep for a

long time. She eyed him bitterly in his bandages. Only last night

she had been tormented by that fear that his face might be marked

for life. Again the trivial! What did it matter whether his face was

marked for life or not?...
It did not occur to her to attempt to realize how intense must have

been the spiritual tribulation which had forced him to confess. She

knew that he was not dying, that he was in no danger whatever, and

she was perfectly indifferent to the genuineness of his own conviction

that he was dying. She simply thought: "He had to go through all that.

If he fancied he was dying, can I help it?" ... Then she looked at her

own empty bed. He reposed; he slept. But she did not repose nor sleep.
She drew aside one of the blinds, and as she did so she could feel the

steady slight current of cold air entering the room from the window

open at the top. The street seemed to be full of daylight. The dawn

had been proceeding in its vast secrecy and was now accomplished.

She drew up the blind slowly, and then the gas-flame over the

dressing-table seemed so pale and futile that she extinguished it,

from a sort of pity. In silence she pulled out the iron bolts in the

window-sash that had been Mrs. Maldon's device for preventing burglars

from opening further a window already open a little, thus combining

security with good hygiene. Louis had laughed at these bolts, but Mrs.

Maldon had so instilled their use into both Rachel and Mrs. Tams that

to insert them at night was part of the unchangeable routine of the

house. Rachel gently pushed up the lower sash and looked forth.
Bycars Lane, though free from mud, was everywhere heavily bedewed. The

narrow pavement glistened. The roofs glistened. Drops of water hung

on all the edges of the great gas-lamp beneath her, which was still

defying the dawn. The few miserable trees and bushes on the vague

lands beyond the lane were dripping with water. The sky was low and

heavy, in scarcely distinguishable shades of purplish grey, and Bycars

Pool, of which she had a glimpse, appeared in its smooth blackness to

be not more wet than the rest of the scene. Nothing stirred. Not the

tiniest branch stirred on the leafless trees, nor a leaf on a grey

rhododendron-bush in a front garden below. Every window within sight

had its blind drawn. No smoke rose from any house-chimney, and the

distant industrial smoke on the horizon hung in the lower air, just

under the clouds, undecided and torpid. The wet air was moveless, and

yet she could feel it impinging with its cool, sharp humidity on her

cheek.
The sensation of this contact was delicious. She was surrounded, not

by the slatternly Five Towns landscape and by the wretchedness of the

familiar bedroom, but by the unanswerable, intimidating, inspiring

mystery of life itself. A man came hurrying with a pole out of the

western vista of the lane, and stopped in front of the gas-lamp, and

in an instant the flame was reduced to a little fat worm of blue, and

the man passed swiftly up the lane, looking straight ahead with bent

shoulders, and was gone. Never before had Rachel actually seen the

lamp put out. Never before had she noticed, as she noticed now, that

the lamp had a number, an identity—1054. The meek acquiescence of

the lamp, and the man's preoccupied haste, seemed to bear some deep

significance, which, however, she could not seize. But the aspect of

the man afflicted her, she did not know why.
Then a number of other figures, in a long spasmodic procession, passed

up the lane after the man, and were gone out of sight. Their heavy

boots clacked on the pavement. They wore thick, dirty greyish-black

clothes, but no overcoats; small tight caps in their hands, and dark

kerchiefs round their necks: about thirty of them in all, colliers

on their way to one of the pits on the Moorthorne ridge. They walked

quickly, but they did not hurry as their forerunner hurried. Several

of them smoked pipes. Though some walked in pairs, none spoke; none

looked up or aside. With one man walked stolidly a young woman, her

overskirt raised and pulled round her head from the back for a shawl;

but even these two did not converse. The procession closed with one or

two stragglers. Rachel had never seen these pilgrims before, but she

had heard them; and Mrs. Maldon had been acquainted with all their

footfalls. They were tragic to Rachel; they infected her with the most

recondite horror of existence; they left tragedy floating behind them

in the lane like an invisible but oppressive cloud. Their utterly

incurious indifference to Rachel in her peignoir at the window was

somehow harrowing.
The dank lane and vaporous, stagnant landscape were once more dead and

silent, and would for a long time remain so, for though potters begin

work early, colliers begin work much earlier, living in a world of

customs of their own. At last a thin column of smoke issued magically

from a chimney down to the left. Some woman was about; some woman's

day had opened within that house. At the thought of that unseen woman

in that unknown house Rachel could have cried. She could not remain at

the window. She was unhappy; but it was not her woe that overcame her,

for if she was unhappy, her unhappiness was nevertheless exquisite.

It was the mere realization that men and women lived that rendered her

emotions almost insupportable. She felt her youth. She thought, "I am

only a girl, and yet my life is ruined already." And even that thought

she hugged amorously as though it were beautiful. Amid the full

disaster and regret, she was glad to be alive. She could not help

exulting in the dreadful moment.
She closed the sash and began to dress, seldom glancing at Louis,

who slept and dreamed and muttered. When she was dressed she looked

carefully in the drawer where he deposited certain articles from his

pockets, in order to find the bundle of notes left by Julian. In vain!

Then she searched for his bunch of keys (which ultimately she found

in one of his pockets) and unlocked his private drawer. The bundle

of notes lay there. She removed it, and hid it away in one of her

own secret places. After she had made preparations to get ready some

invalid's food at short notice, she went downstairs.

VII
She went downstairs without any definite purpose—merely because

activity of some kind was absolutely necessary to her. The clock

in the lobby showed dimly a quarter past five. In the chilly twilit

kitchen the green-lined silver-basket lay on the table in front of the

window, placed there by a thoughtful and conscientious Mrs. Tams. On

the previous morning Rachel had given very precise orders about the

silver (as the workaday electro-plate was called), but owing to the

astounding events of the day the orders had not been executed. Mrs.

Tams had evidently determined to carry them out at an early hour.
Rachel opened a cupboard and drew forth the apparatus for cleaning.

She was intensely fatigued, weary, and seemingly spiritless, but she

began to clean the silver—at first with energy and then with serious

application. She stood at the table, cleaning, as she had stood there

when Louis came into her kitchen on the night of the robbery; and she

thought of his visit and of her lost bliss, and the tears fell

from her eyes on the newspaper which protected the whiteness of the

scrubbed table. She would not think of the future; could not. She went

on cleaning, and that silver had never been cleaned as she cleaned it

then. She cleaned it with every attribute of herself, forgetting her

fatigue. The tears dried on her cheek. The faithful, scrupulous work

either drugged or solaced her. Just as she was finishing, Mrs. Tarns,

with her immense bodice unfastened, came downstairs, apronless. The

lobby clock struck six.
"Eh, missis!" breathed Mrs. Tams. "What's this?"
Rachel gave a nervous laugh.
"I was up. Mr. Fores was asleep, and I had to do something, so I

thought—"
"Has he had a good night, ma'am?"
"Fair. Yes, pretty good. I must run up and see if he is awake."
Mrs. Tams saw the stains on Rachel's cheeks, but she could not mention

them. Rachel had an impulse to fall on Mrs. Tams' enormous breast and

weep. But the conventions of domesticity were far too strong for

her also. Mrs. Tams was the general servant; what Louis occasionally

called "the esteemed skivvy." Once Mrs. Tams had been wife, mother,

grandmother, victim, slave, diplomatist, serpent, heroine. Once she

had bent from morn till night under the terrific weight of a million

perils and responsibilities. Once she could never be sure of her next

meal, or the roof over her head, or her skin, or even her bones. Once

she had been the last resource and refuge not merely of a house, but

of half a street, and she had had a remedy for every ill, a balm

for every wound. But now she was safe, out of harm's way. She had no

responsibilities worth a rap. She had everything an old woman ought

to desire. And yet the silly old woman felt a lack, as she impotently

watched Rachel leave the kitchen. Perhaps she wanted her eye blacked,

or the menace of a policeman, or a child down with diphtheria, to

remind her that the world revolved.

CHAPTER XIII
DEAD-LOCK

I
Louis had wakened up a few minutes before Rachel returned to

the bedroom from that most wonderfully conscientious spell of

silver-cleaning. He was relieved to find himself alone. He was ill,

perhaps very ill, but he felt unquestionably better than in the night.

He was delivered from the appalling fear of death which had tortured

and frightened him, and his thankfulness was intense; and yet at the

same time he was aware of a sort of heroical sentimental regret that

he was not, after all, dead; he would almost have preferred to die

with grandeur, young, unfortunate, wept for by an inconsolable

wife doomed to everlasting widowhood. He was ashamed of his bodily

improvement, which rendered him uncomfortably self-conscious, for

he had behaved as though dying when, as the event proved, he was not

dying.
When Rachel came in, this self-consciousness grew terrible. And in his

weakness, his constraint, his febrile perturbation which completely

destroyed presence of mind, he feebly remarked—
"Did any one call yesterday to ask how I was?"
As soon as he had said it he knew that it was inept, and quite

unsuitable to the role which he ought to play.
Rachel had gone straight to the dressing-table, apparently ignoring

him, though she could not possibly have failed to notice that he was

awake. She turned sharply and gazed at him with a look of inimical

contempt that aggrieved and scarified him very acutely. Making no

answer to his query, content solely to condemn it with her eyes as

egotistic and vain, she said—
"I'm going to make you some food."
And then she curtly showed him her bent back, and over the foot of the

bed he could see her preparations—preliminary stirring with a spoon,

the placing of the bright tin saucepan on the lamp, the opening of the

wick, seizing of the match-box.
As soon as the cooking was in train, she threw up the window wide and

then came to the bed.
"I'll just put your bed to rights again," she remarked, and seized the

pillow, waiting implacably for him to raise his head. He had to raise

his head.
"I'm very ill," he moaned.
She replied in a tone of calm indifference—
"I know you are. But you'll soon be better. You're getting a little

better every hour." And she finished arranging the bed, which was

presently in a state of smooth geometrical correctness. He could find

no fault with her efficiency, nor with her careful handling of his

sensitive body. But the hard, the marmoreal cruelty of his wife's

spirit exquisitely wounded his soul, which, after all, was at least as

much in need of consolation as his body. He was positively daunted.

II
He had passed through dreadful moments in the early part of the night

while Rachel slept. When he had realized that he was doomed—for the

conviction that death was upon him had been absolutely sincere and

final for a long time—he was panic-stricken, impressed, and strangely

proud, all at once. But the panic was paramount. He was afraid,

horribly afraid. His cowardice was ghastly, even to himself, shot

through though it was by a peculiar appreciation of the grandiosity

of his fate as a martyr to clumsy chance. He was reduced by it to

the trembling repentant sinner, as the proud prisoner is reduced to

abjection by prolonged and secret torture in Oriental prisons. He

ranged in fright over the whole of his career, and was obliged to

admit, and to admit with craven obsequiousness, that he had been a

wicked man, obstinate in wickedness.
He remembered matters which had utterly vanished from his memory. He

remembered, for example, the excellence of his moral aspirations when

he had first thought of Rachel as a wife, and the firm, high resolves

which were to be carried out if he married her. Forgotten!

Forgotten! As soon as he had won her he had thought of nothing but

self-indulgence, pleasure, capricious delights. His tailor still

languished for money long justly due. He had not even restored the

defalcations in Horrocleave's petty cash. Of course it would have

been difficult to restore a sum comparatively so large without causing

suspicion. To restore it would have involved a long series of minute

acts, alterations of alterations in the cash entries, and constant

ingenuity in a hundred ways. But it ought to have been done, and might

have been done. It might have been done. He admitted that candidly,

fully, with despicable tremblings....
And the worst of all, naturally, was the theft from his aunt. Theft?

Was it a theft? He had never before consented to define the affair

as a theft; it had been a misfortune, an indiscretion. But now he was

ready to call it a theft, in order to be on the safe side. For the

sake of placating Omnipotence let it be deemed a theft, and even a

mean theft, entailing dire consequences on a weak old woman! Let it be

as bad as the severest judge chose to make it! He would not complain.

He would accept the arraignment (though really he had not been so

blameworthy, etc....). He knew that with all his sins he, possessed

the virtues of good nature, kindness, and politeness. He was not

wholly vile. In some ways he honestly considered himself a model to

mankind.
And then he had recalled certain information received in childhood

from authoritative persons about the merciful goodness of God. His

childhood had been rather ceremoniously religious, for his step-uncle,

the Lieutenant-General, was a great defender of Christianity as well

as of the British Empire. The Lieutenant-General had even written

a pamphlet against a ribald iconoclastic book published by the

Rationalist Press Association, in which pamphlet he had made a sorry

mess of Herbert Spencer. All the Lieutenant-General's relatives and

near admirers went to church, and they all went to precisely the same

kind of church, for no other kind would have served. Louis, however,

had really liked going to church. There had once even been a

mad suggestion that he should become a choir-boy, but the

Lieutenant-General had naturally decided that it was not meet for a

child of breeding to associate with plebeians in order to chant the

praises of the Almighty.
Louis at his worst had never quite ceased to attend church, though he

was under the impression that his religious views had broadened, if

not entirely changed. Beneath the sudden heavy menace of death he

discovered that his original views were, after all, the most authentic

and the strongest. And he had much longed for converse with a

clergyman, who would repeat to him the beautiful reassurances of his

infancy. Even late in the afternoon, hours before the supreme crisis,

he would have welcomed a clergyman, for he was already beginning to

be afraid. He would have liked a clergyman to drop in by accident; he

would have liked the first advances to come from the clergyman.
But he could not bring himself to suggest that the rector of St.

Luke's, of whose flock he now formed part, should be sent for. He had

demanded a lawyer, and that was as near to a clergyman as he could

get. He had been balked of the lawyer. Further on in the evening,

when his need was more acute and his mind full of frightful secret

apprehensions, he was as far as ever from obtaining a clergyman. And

he knew that, though his eternal welfare might somehow depend on the

priest, he could never articulate to Rachel the words, "I should

like to see a clergyman." It would seem too absurd to ask for a

clergyman.... Strangeness of the human heart!
It was after Rachel had fallen asleep that the idea of confession

had occurred to him as a means towards safety in the future life. The

example of Julian had inspired him. He had despised Julian; he had

patronized Julian; but in his extremity he had been ready to imitate

him. He seemed to conceive that confession before death must be

excellent for the soul. At any rate, it prevented one from going down

to the tomb with a lie tacit on the lips. He was very ill, very

weak, very intimidated. And he was very solitary and driven in on

himself—not so much because Rachel had gone to sleep as because

neither Rachel nor anybody else would believe that he was really

dying. His spirit was absorbed in the gravest preoccupations that can

trouble a man. His need of sympathy and succour was desperate. Thus he

had wakened Rachel. At first she had been as sympathetic and consoling

as he could desire. She had held his hand and sat on the bed. The

momentary relief was wonderful. And he had been encouraged to confess.
He had prodded himself on to confession by the thought that Rachel

must have known of his guilt all along—otherwise she would never have

told that senseless lie about the scullery door being open. Hence his

confession could not surprise her. She would receive it in the right,

loving, wifely attitude, telling him that he was making too much of

a little, that it was splendid of him to confess, and generally

exonerating and rehabilitating him.
Then he had begun to confess. The horrible change in her tone as he

came to the point had unnerved him. Her wild sobs when the confession

was made completed his dismay. And then, afterwards, her incredible

harshness and cruelty, her renewed refusal, flat and disdainful,

to believe that he was dying—these things were the most wounding

experience of his entire existence. As for her refusal to listen to

the rest of his story, the important part, the exculpatory part—it

was monstrously unjust. He had had an instant's satisfaction on

beholding her confusion at being charged with the lie about the

scullery door, but it was a transient advantage. He was so ill....

She had bullied him with the lacerating emphasis of her taciturn

remarks.... And at last she had requested him not to make it any more

awkward for her!...

III
When he had obediently taken the food and thanked her for it very

nicely, he felt much better. The desire for a clergyman, or even for a

lawyer, passed away from his mind; he forgot the majority of his sins

and his aspirations, and the need for restoring the defalcations to

Jim Horrocleave seemed considerably less urgent. Rachel stayed by him

while he ate, but she would not meet his glance, and looked carefully

at the window.
"As soon as I've tidied up the room, I'll just sponge your hands,"

said she. "The doctor will be here early. I suppose I mustn't touch

your face."
Louis inquired—
"How do you know he'll be here early?"
"He said he should—because of the dressings, you know."
She went to work on the room, producing a duster from somewhere, and

ringing for Mrs. Tams, who, however, was not permitted to enter. Louis

hated these preparations for the doctor. He had never in his life been

able to understand why women were always so absurdly afraid of the

doctor's eye. As if the doctor would care! Moreover, the room was

being tidied for the doctor, not for the invalid! The invalid didn't

matter! When she came to him with a bowl of water, soap, and a towel,

he loathed the womanish scheme of being washed in bed.
"I'll get up," he said. "I'm lots better." He had previously intended

to feign extreme illness, but he forgot.
"Oh no, you won't," she replied coldly. "First you think you're dying,

and then you think you're all right. You won't stir out of that bed

till the doctor's been, at any rate."
And she lodged the bowl dangerously between his knees. He pretended to

be contemptuous of her refusal to let him get up, but in fact he

was glad of an excuse for not making good his boast. His previous

statement that he was very ill was much nearer to the truth than the

fine talking about being "lots better." If not very ill, he was, at

any rate, more ill than he now thought he was, and eating had fatigued

him. Nevertheless, he would wash his own hands. Rachel yielded to him

in this detail with cynical indifference. She put the towel by the

bowl, and left him to balance the bowl and keep the soap off the

counterpane as best he could, while she rummaged in one of the drawers

of the wardrobe—obviously for the simple sake of rummaging.
Her unwifeliness was astounding; it was so astounding that Louis did

not all at once quite realize how dangerously he was wounded by it.

He had seen that hard, contumelious mask on her face several times

before; he had seen it, for instance, when she had been expressing her

views on Councillor Batchgrew; but he had not conceived, in his absurd

male confidence, that it would ever be directed against himself. He

could not snatch the mask from her face, but he wondered how he might

pierce it, and incidentally hurt her and make her cry softly. Ah!

He had seen her in moods of softness which were celestial to

him—surpassing all dreams of felicity!
The conviction of his own innocence and victimhood strengthened

in him. Amid the morbid excitations of the fear of death, he had

forgotten that in strict truth he had not stolen a penny from his

great-aunt, that he was utterly innocent. He now vividly remembered

that his sole intention in taking possession of the bank-notes had

been to teach his great-aunt a valuable lesson about care in the

guarding of money. Afterwards he had meant to put the notes back where

he had found them; chance had prevented; he had consistently acted for

the best in very sudden difficulties, and after all, in the result, it

was not he who was responsible for the destruction of the notes, but

Rachel.... True, that in the night his vision of the affair had been

less favourable to himself, but in the night illness had vitiated his

judgment, which was not strange, seeing the dreadful accident he had

experienced.... He might have died, and where would Rachel

have been then?... Was it not amazing that a young wife who had just

escaped widowhood so narrowly could behave to a husband, a seriously

sick husband, as Rachel was behaving to him?
He wished that he had not used the word "collar" in confessing to

Rachel. It was equal to "steal." Its significance was undebatable.

Yes, "collar" was a grave error of phrasing.
"I'm about done with this basin thing," he said, with all possible

dignity, and asked for brushes of various sorts for the completion of

his toilet. She served him slowly, coolly. Her intention was clear

to act as a capable but frigid nurse—not as a wife. He saw that she

thought herself the wife of a thief, and that she was determined not

to be the wife of a thief. He could not bear it. The situation must be

changed immediately, because his pride was bleeding to death.
"I say," he began, when she had taken away the towel and his

tooth-powder.
"What?" Her tone challenged him.
"You wouldn't let me finish last night. I just wanted to tell you that

I didn't—"
"I've no wish to hear another word." She stopped him, precisely as she

had stopped him in the night. She was at the washstand.
"I should be obliged if you'd look at me when you speak to me," he

reproached her manners. "It's only polite."
She turned to him with face flaming. They were both aware that his

deportment was better than hers; and he perceived that the correction

had abraded her susceptibility.
"I'll look at you all right," she answered, curtly and rather loudly.
He adopted a superior attitude.
"Of course I'm ill and weak," he said, "but even if I am I suppose I'm

entitled to some consideration." He lay back on the pillow.
"I can't help your being ill," she answered. "It's not my fault. And

if you're so ill and weak as all that, it seems to me the best thing

you can do is to be quiet and not to talk, especially about—about

that!"
"Well, perhaps you'll let me be the best judge of what I ought to

talk about. Anyhow, I'm going to talk about it, and you're going to

listen."
"I'm not."
"I say you're going to listen," he insisted, turning on his side

towards her. "And why not? Why, what on earth did I say last night,

after all, I should like to know?"
"You said you'd taken the other part of the money of Mrs.

Maldon's—that's what you said. You thought you were dying, and so you

told me."
"That's just what I want to explain. I'm going to explain it to you."
"No explanations for me, thanks!" she sneered, walking in the

direction of the hearth. "I'd sooner hear anything, anything, than

your explanations." She seemed to shudder.
He nerved himself.
"I tell you I found that money," he cried, recommencing.
"Well, good-bye," she said, moving to the door. "You don't seem to

understand."
At the same moment there was a knock at the door.
"Come in, Mrs. Tarns," said Rachel calmly.
"She mustn't come in now," Louis protested.
"Come in, Mrs. Tams," Rachel repeated decisively.
And Mrs. Tams entered, curtsying towards the bed.
"What is it?" Rachel asked her.
"It's the greengrocer's cart, ma'am." The greengrocer usually did send

round on Saturday mornings.
"I'll go down. Just clear up that washstand, will you?"
It was remarkable to Louis how chance would favour a woman in an

altercation. But he had decided, even if somewhat hysterically, to

submit to no more delay, and to end the altercation—and moreover, to

end it in his own way.
"Rachel!" he called. Several times he called her name, more and more

loudly. He ignored what was due to servants, to greengrocers, and to

the dignity of employers. He kept on calling.
"Shall I fetch missis, sir?" Mrs. Tams suggested at length.
He nodded. Mrs. Tams departed, laden. Certainly the fat creature, from

whom nothing could be hid by a younger generation, had divined that

strife had supervened on illness, and that great destinies hung upon

the issue. Neither Mrs. Tams nor Rachel returned to the bedroom. Louis

began again to call for Rachel, and then to yell for her. He could

feel that the effort was exhausting him, but he was determined to

vanquish her.

IV
Without a sound she startlingly appeared in the room.
"What's the matter?" she inquired, with her irritating assumption of

tranquillity.
"You know what's the matter."
"I wish you wouldn't scream like a baby," she said.
"You know I want to speak to you, and you're keeping out of the way on

purpose."
Rachel said—
"Look here, Louis! Do you want me to leave the house altogether?"
He thought—
"What is she saying? We've only been married a few weeks. This is

getting serious."
Aloud he answered—
"Of course I don't want you to leave the house."
"Well, then, don't say any more. Because if you do, I shall. I've

heard all I want to hear. There are some things I can bear, and some I

can't bear."
"If you don't listen—!" he exclaimed. "I'm warning you!"
She glanced at the thief in him, and at the coward penitent of the

night, with the most desolating disdain, and left the room. That was

her answer to his warning.
"All right, my girl! All right!" he said to himself, when she had

gone, pulling together his self-esteem, his self-pity, and his

masculinity. "You'll regret this. You see if you don't. As to leaving

the house, we shall see who'll leave the house. Wait till I'm on my

legs again. If there is to be a scandal, there shall be a scandal."
One thing was absolutely sure—he could not and would not endure her

contumely, nor even her indifferent scorn. For him to live with it

would be ridiculous as well as impossible. He was weak, but two facts

gave him enormous strength. First, he loved her less than she loved

him, and hence she was at a disadvantage. But supposing her passion

for him was destroyed? Then the second fact came into play. He had

money. He had thousands of pounds, loose, available! To such a nature

as his the control of money gives a sense of everlasting security.

Already he dreamt of freedom, of roaming the wide world, subject to no

yoke but a bachelor's whim.

CHAPTER XIV
THE MARKET

I
Rachel thought she understood all Louis' mental processes. With the

tragic self-confidence of the inexperienced wife, she was convinced

that she had nothing to learn about the secret soul of the stranger to

whom she had utterly surrendered herself, reserving from him naught

of the maiden. Each fresh revelation of him she imagined to be final,

completing her studies. In fact, it would have taken at least ten

years of marriage to prove to her that a perception of ignorance is

the summit of knowledge. She had not even realized that human nature

is chiefly made up of illogical and absurd contradictions. Thus

she left the house that Saturday morning gloomy, perhaps hopeless,

certainly quite undecided as to the future, but serene, sure of her

immediate position, and sure that Louis would act like Louis. She knew

that she had the upper hand, both physically and morally. The doctor

had called and done his work, and given a very reassuring report. She

left Louis to Mrs. Tams, as was entirely justifiable, merely informing

him that she had necessary errands, and even this information she gave

through her veil, a demure contrivance which she had adapted for the

first time on her honeymoon. It was his role to accept her august

decisions.
The forenoon was better than the dawn. The sun had emerged; the

moisture had nearly disappeared, except in the road; and the impulse

of spring was moving in the trees and in the bodies of young women;

the sky showed a virginal blue; the wandering clouds were milky and

rounded, the breeze infinitely soft. It seemed to be in an earlier age

that the dark colliers had silently climbed the steep of Bycars

Lane amid the dankness and that the first column of smoke had risen

forlornly from the chimney.
In spite of her desolated heart, and of her primness, Rachel stepped

forward airily. She was going forth to an enormous event, namely, her

first apparition in the shopping streets of the town on a Saturday

morning as Mrs. Louis Fores, married woman. She might have postponed

it, but into what future? Moreover, she was ashamed of being diffident

about it. And, in the peculiar condition of her mind, she would have

been ashamed to let a spiritual crisis, however appalling, interfere

with the natural, obvious course of her duties. So far as the world

was concerned, she was a happy married woman, who had to make her

debut as a shopping housewife, and hence she was determined that her

debut should be made.... And yet, possibly she might not have ventured

away from the house at all, had she not felt that if she did not

escape for a time from its unbreathable atmosphere into the liberty of

the streets, she would stifle and expire. Wherever she put herself

in the house she could not feel alone. In the streets she felt alone,

even when saluting new acquaintances and being examined and probed by

their critical stare. The sight of these acquaintances reminded her

that she had a long list of calls to repay. And then the system of

paying calls and repaying, and the whole system of society, seemed

monstrously fanciful and unreal to her. There was only one reality.

The solid bricks of the pavement suddenly trembled under her feet as

though she were passing over a suspension-bridge. The enterprise of

shopping became idiotic, humorous, incredibly silly in the face of

that reality.
Nevertheless, the social system of Bursley, as exemplified in Wedgwood

Street and the market-place, its principal shopping thoroughfares, was

extremely alluring, bright, and invigorating that morning. It almost

intoxicated, and had, indeed, a similar effect to that of a sparkling

drink. Rachel had never shopped at large with her own money before.

She had executed commissions for Mrs. Maldon. She had been an unpaid

housekeeper to her father and brother. Now she was shopping as

mistress of a house and of money. She owed an account of her outlay

to nobody, not even to Louis. She recalled the humble and fantastic

Saturday night when she had shopped with Louis as reticule-carrier

... centuries since. The swiftness and unforeseeableness of events

frightened the girl masquerading as a wise, perfected woman. Her heart

lay like a weight in her corsage for an instant, and the next instant

she was in the bright system again, because she was so young.
Here and there in the streets, and in small groups in the chief shops,

you saw prim ladies of every age, each with a gloved hand clasped over

a purse. (But sometimes the purse lay safe under the coverlet of

a perambulator.) These purses made all the ladies equal, for their

contents were absolutely secret from all save the owners. All the

ladies were spending, and the delight of spending was theirs. And in

theory every purse was inexhaustible. At any rate, it was impossible

to conceive a purse empty. The system wore the face of the ideal.

Manners were proper to the utmost degree; they neatly marked the

equality of the shoppers and the profound difference between the

shoppers and the shopkeepers. All ladies were agreeable, all babies in

perambulators were darlings. The homes thus represented by ladies and

babies were clearly polite homes, where reigned suavity, tranquillity,

affection, and plenty. Civilization was justified in Wedgwood

Street and the market-place—and also, to some extent, in St. Luke's

Square.... And Rachel was one of these ladies. Her gloved hand closed

over a purse exactly in the style of the others. And her purse, regard

being had to the inheritance of her husband, was supposed to hide vast

sums; so much so that ladies who had descended from distant heights

in pony-carts gazed upon her with the respect due to a rival. All

welcomed her into the exclusive, correct little world—not only the

shopkeepers but the buyers therein. She represented youthful love. Her

life must be, and was, an idyll! True, she had no perambulator, but

middle-aged ladies greeted her with wistfulness in their voices and in

their eyes.
She smiled often as she told and retold the story of Louis' accident,

and gave positive assurances that he was in no danger, and would

not bear a scar. She blushed often. She was shyly happy in her

unhappiness. The experience alternated between the unreal and the

real. The extraordinary complexity of life was beginning to put its

spell on her. She could not determine the relative values of the

various facets of the experience.
When she had done the important parts of her business, she thought she

would go into the covered market, which, having one entrance in

the market-place and another in Wedgwood Street, connects the two

thoroughfares. She had never been into the covered market because

Mrs. Maldon had a prejudice against its wares. She went out of mere

curiosity, just to enlarge her knowledge of her adopted town. The huge

interior, with its glazed roof, was full of clatter, shouting, and

the smell of innumerable varieties of cheese. She passed a second-hand

bookstall without seeing it, and then discerned admirable potatoes at

three-halfpence a peck less than she had been paying—and Mrs. Maldon

was once more set down as an old lady with peculiarities. However, by

the time Rachel had made a critical round of the entire place, with

its birds in cages, popular songs at a penny, sweetstuffs, cheap

cottons and woollens, bright tinware, colonial fleshmeat, sausage

displays, and particularly its cheeses, Mrs. Maldon was already

recovering her reputation as a woman whose death was an irreparable

loss to the town.
As Rachel passed the negligible second-hand bookstall again, it was

made visible to her by the fact that Councillor Thomas Batchgrew was

just emerging from the shop behind it, with a large volume in his

black-gloved hands. Thomas Batchgrew came out of the dark bookshop

as a famous old actor, accustomed to decades of crude public worship,

comes out of a fashionable restaurant into a fashionable thoroughfare.

His satisfied and self-conscious countenance showed that he knew

that nearly everybody in sight was or ought to be acquainted with his

identity and his renown, and showed also that his pretence of being

unaware of this tremendous and luscious fact was playful and not

seriously meant to deceive a world of admirers. He was wearing a light

tweed suit, with a fancy waistcoat and a hard, pale-grey hat. As he

aged, his tendency to striking pale attire was becoming accentuated;

at any rate, it had the advantage of harmonizing with his unique

whiskers—those whiskers which differentiated him from all the rest of

the human race in the Five Towns.
Rachel blushed, partly because he was suddenly so close to her, partly

because she disapproved of the cunning expression on his red, seamed

face and was afraid he might divine her thoughts, and partly because

she recalled the violent things she had said against him to Louis. But

as soon as Thomas Batchgrew caught sight of her the expression of his

faced changed in an instant to one of benevolence and artless joy; the

change in it was indeed dramatic.
And Rachel, pleased and flattered, said to herself, almost startled—
"He really admires me. And I do believe he always did."
And since admiration is a sweet drug, whether offered by a rascal

or by the pure in heart, she forgot momentarily the horror of her

domestic dilemma.

II
"Eh, lass!" Thomas Batchgrew was saying familiarly, after he had

inquired about Louis, "I'm rare glad for thy sake it was no worse."

His frank implication that he was glad only for her sake gratified and

did not wound her as a wife.
The next moment he had dismissed the case of Louis and was displaying

to her the volume which he carried. It was a folio Bible, printed by

the Cornishman Tregorthy in the town of Bursley, within two hundred

yards of where they were standing, in the earliest years of the

nineteenth century—a bibliographical curiosity, as Thomas Batchgrew

vaguely knew, for he wet his gloved thumb and, resting the book on

one raised knee, roughly turned over several pages till he came to the

title-page containing the word "Bursley," which he showed with pride

to Rachel. Rachel, however, not being in the slightest degree a

bibliophile, discerned no interest whatever in the title-page.

She merely murmured with politeness, "Oh, yes! Bursley," while

animadverting privately on the old man's odious trick of wetting his

gloved thumb and leaving marks on the pages.
"The good old Book!" he said. "I've been after that volume for six

months and more. I knew I should get it, but he's a stiff un—yon is,"

jerking his shoulder in the direction of the second-hand bookseller.

Then he put the folio under his arm, delighted at the souvenir of

having worsted somebody in a bargain, and repeated, "The good old

Book!"
Rachel reflected—
"You unspeakable old sinner!"
Still, she liked his attitude towards herself. In addition to the book

he insisted on carrying a small white parcel of hers which she had

not put into the reticule. They climbed the steps out of the covered

market and walked along the market-place together. And Rachel

unmistakably did find pleasure in being seen thus with the great and

powerful, if much criticized, Thomas Batchgrew, him to whom several

times, less than a year earlier, she had scathingly referred as

that man. His escort in the thoroughfare, and especially

his demeanour towards herself, gave her a standing which she could

otherwise scarcely have attained. Moreover, people might execrate him

in private, but that he had conquered the esteem of their secret souls

was well proved by their genuine eagerness to salute him as he walked

sniffing along. He counted himself one of the seven prides of the

district, and perhaps he was not far out.
"Come in a minute, lass," he said in a low, confidential voice,

as they reached his branch shop, just beyond Malkin's. "I'll—" He

paused.
A motor, apparently enormous, was buzzing motion-less in the wide

entry by the side of the shop. It very slowly moved forward, crossed

the footpath and half the street opposite the Town Hall, impeding a

tram-car, and then curved backward into a position by the kerbstone.

John's Ernest was at the steering-wheel. Councillor Batchgrew stood

still with his mouth open to watch the manoeuvre.
"This is John's Ernest—my son John's eldest. Happen ye know him?"

said Batchgrew to Rachel. "He's a good lad."
John's Ernest, a pleasant-featured young man of twenty-five, blushed

and raised his hat. And Rachel also blushed as she nodded. It was

astonishing that old Batchgrew could have a grandson with so honest

a look on his face, but she had heard that son John, too, was very

different from his father.
"Dunna go till I've seen thee," said Mr. Batchgrew to John's Ernest,

and to Rachel, "Come in, Mrs. Fores."
John's Ernest silenced the car, and extricated himself with practised

rapidity from the driver's seat.
"Where are ye going?" asked his grandfather.
"I'm going to lock the garage doors," said John's Ernest, with a

humorous smile which seemed to add, "Unless you'd like them to be left

open all Saturday afternoon." Rachel vividly remembered the playful,

boyish voice which she had heard one night when the motor-car had

called to take Mr. Batchgrew to Red Cow.
The councillor nodded.
In the small, untidy, disagreeable, malodorous shop, which in about

half a century had scarcely altered its aspect, Thomas Batchgrew

directed Rachel to a corner behind the counter and behind a partition,

with a view of a fragment of the window. As she passed she saw one of

the Batchgrew women (the wife of another grandson) and three little

girls of various sizes flash in succession across an open doorway at

the back. The granddaughter-in-law, who had an abode full of costly

wedding-presents over the shop, had been one of her callers, but when

they flashed across that doorway the Batchgrew women made a point of

ignoring all phenomena in the shop.
"Has Louis decided about them debentures?" Thomas Batchgrew asked,

still in a very low and confidential tone, as the two stood together

in the corner. He had put the Book and the parcel down on a very

ragged blotting-pad that lay on a chipped and ink-stained deal desk,

and began to finger a yellow penholder. There was nobody else in the

shop.
Rachel had foreseen his question.
She answered calmly: "Yes. He's quite decided that on the whole it'll

be better if he doesn't put his money into debentures."
There was no foundation whatever for this statement; yet, in

uttering the lie, she was clearly conscious of a feeling of lofty

righteousness. She faced Thomas Batchgrew, though not with a

tranquillity perfectly maintained, and she still enjoyed his

appreciation of her, but she did not seem to care whether he guessed

that she was lying or not.
"I'm sorry, lass!" he said simply, sniffing. "The lad's a fool. It

isn't as if I've got to go hawking seven per cent. debentures to get

rid of 'em—and in a concern like that, too! They'd never ha' been

seven per cent if it hadna been for me. But it was you as I was

thinking of when I offered 'em to Louis. I thought I should be doing

ye a good turn."
The old man smiled amid his loud sniffs. He was too old to have

retained any save an artistic interest in women. But an artistic

interest in them he certainly had; and at an earlier period he had

acquainted himself with life, as his eye showed. Rachel blushed a

third time that morning, and more deeply than before. He was seriously

nattering her now. Endearing qualities that had expired in him long

ago seemed to be resuscitated and to animate his ruined features.

Rachel dimly understood how it was that some woman had once married

him and borne him a lot of children, and how it was that he had been

so intimate and valued a friend of the revered husband of such a woman

as Mrs. Maldon. She was, in the Five Towns phrase, "flustered." She

almost believed what Thomas Batchgrew had said. She did believe it.

She had misjudged him on the Thursday night when he spread the lure of

the seven per cent. in front of Louis. At any rate, he assuredly did

not care, personally, whether Louis accepted the debentures or not.
"However," the councillor went on, "he's got to know his own business

best. And I don't know as it's any affair o' mine. But I was just

thinking of you. When the husband has a good investment, th' wife

generally comes in for something.... And what's more, it 'ud ha'

stopped him from doing anything silly with his brass! You

know."
"Yes," she murmured.
"I'm talking to ye because I've taken a fancy to ye," said the

councillor. "I knew what you were the first time I set eyes on ye. Oh,

I don't mind telling ye now—what harm is there in it? I'd a sort of a

fancy as one day you and John's Ernest might ha' hit it off. I had it

in my mind like."
A crude compliment, possibly in bad taste, possibly offensive; but

Rachel was singularly moved by the revelation thus made. Before she

could find a reply John's Ernest came into the shop, followed by an

aproned assistant.

III
Then she was sitting by John's Ernest's side in the big motor-car,

with her possessions at her feet. The enthronement had happened in a

few moments. John's Ernest was going to Hanbridge.
"Ye can run Mrs. Fores up home on yer way," Thomas Batchgrew had

suggested.
"But Bycars Lane is miles out of your way!" Rachel had cried.
Both men had smiled. "Won't make a couple of minutes' difference in

the car," John's Ernest had modestly murmured.
She had been afraid to get into the automobile—afraid with a sort of

stage-fright; afraid, as she might have been had she been called

upon to sing at a concert in the Town Hall. She had imagined that all

Bursley was gazing at her as she climbed into the car. Over the face

of England automobiles are far more common than cuckoos, and yet for

the majority, even of the proud and solvent middle class, they still

remain as unattainable, as glitteringly wondrous, as a title. Rachel

had never been in an automobile before; she had never hoped to be

in an automobile. A few days earlier, and she had been regarding a

bicycle as rather romantic! Louis had once mentioned a motor-cycle

and side-carriage for herself, but she had rebuffed the idea with a

shudder.
The whole town slid away behind her. The car was out of the

market-place and crossing the top of Duck Bank, the scene of Louis'

accident, before she had settled her skirts. She understood why the

men had smiled at her; it was no more trouble for the car to go to

Bycars than it would be for her to run upstairs. The swift movement of

the car, silent and arrogant, and the occasional deep bass mysterious

menace of its horn, and the grace of John's Ernest's gestures on the

wheel as he curved the huge vehicle like a phantom round lumbering

obstacles—these things fascinated and exalted her.
In spite of the horrible secret she carried all the time in her heart,

she was somehow filled with an instinctive joy. And she began to

perceive changes in her own perspective. The fine Louis, whom she

had regarded as the summit of mankind, could never offer her an

automobile; he existed entirely in a humbler world; he was, after all,

a young man in a very small way of affairs. Batchgrew's automobile

would swallow up, week by week, more than the whole of Louis' income.

And further, John's Ernest by her side was invested with the mighty

charm of one who easily and skilfully governs a vast and dangerous

organism. All the glory of the inventors and perfecters of

automobiles, and of manufacturing engineers, and of capitalists who

could pay for their luxurious caprices, was centred in John's Ernest,

merely because he directed and subjugated the energy of the miraculous

machine.
And John's Ernest was so exquisitely modest and diffident, and yet had

an almost permanent humorous smile. But the paramount expression on

his face was honesty. She had never hitherto missed the expression of

honesty on Louis' face, but she realized now that it was not there....

And she had been adjudged worthy of John's Ernest! The powerful of the

world had had their eyes on her! Not Louis alone had noted her! Had

Fate chosen, and had she herself chosen, that very motor-car might

have been hers, and she at that instant riding in it as the mistress

thereof! Strange thoughts, which intensely flattered and fostered her

self-esteem. But she still had the horrible secret to carry with her.
When the car stopped in front of her gate, she forced open the door

and jumped down with almost hysterical speed, said "Good-bye" and

"Thank you" to John's Ernest, who becomingly blushed, and ran round

the back of the car with her purchases. The car went on up the lane,

the intention of John's Ernest being evident to proceed along Park

Road and the Moorthorne ridge to Hanbridge rather than turn the car

in the somewhat narrow lane. Rachel, instead of entering the house,

thrust her parcels frantically on to the top step against the front

door, and rushed down the steps again and down the lane. In a minute

she was overtaking a man.
"Louis!" she cried.
From the car she had seen the incredible vision of Louis walking down

the lane from the house. He and John's Ernest had not noticed each

other, nor had Louis noticed that his wife was in the car.
Louis stopped now and looked back, hesitant.
There he was, with his plastered, pale face all streaked with

greyish-white lines! Really Rachel had difficulty in believing her

eyes. She had left him in bed, weak, broken; and he was there in the

road fully dressed for the town and making for the town—a dreadful

sight, but indubitably moving unaided on his own legs. It was simply

monstrous! Fury leaped up in her. She had never heard of anything more

monstrous. The thing was an absolute outrage on her nursing of him.
"Are you stark, staring mad?" she demanded.
He stood weakly regarding her. It was clear that he was already very

enfeebled by his fantastic exertions.
"I wonder how much farther you would have gone without falling!" she

said. "I'll thank you to come back this very instant!... This very

instant!"
He had no strength to withstand her impetuous anger. His lower lip

fell. He obeyed with some inarticulate words.
"And I should like to know what Mrs. Tams was doing!" said Rachel.
She neither guessed nor cared what was the intention of Louis'

shocking, impossible escapade. She grasped his arm firmly. In ten

minutes he was in bed again, under control, and Rachel was venting

herself on Mrs. Tams, who took oath that she had been utterly unaware

of the master's departure from the house.

CHAPTER XV
THE CHANGED MAN

I
Exactly a week passed, and Easter had come, before Rachel could set

out upon an enterprise which she both longed and hated to perform. In

the meantime the situation in the house remained stationary, except

that after a relapse Louis' condition had gradually improved. She

nursed him; he permitted himself to be nursed; she slept near him

every night; no scene of irritation passed between them. But nothing

was explained; even the fact that Rachel on the Saturday morning

had overtaken Louis instead of meeting him—a detail which in secret

considerably puzzled Louis, since it implied that his wife had been

in the house when he left it—even this was not explained; as for the

motor-car, Louis, absorbed, had scarcely noticed it, and Rachel

did not mention it. She went on from one day into the next, proud,

self-satisfied, sure of her strength and her position, indifferently

scornful of Louis, and yet fatally stricken; she knew not in the least

what was to be done, and so she waited for Destiny. Louis had to stop

in bed for five days. His relapse worried Dr. Yardley, who, however,

like many doctors, was kept in complete ignorance of the truth;

Rachel was ashamed to confess that her husband had monstrously taken

advantage of her absence to rise up and dress and go out; and Louis

had said no word. On the Friday he was permitted to sit in a chair

in the bedroom, and on Saturday he had the freedom of the house.

It surprised Rachel that on the Saturday he had not dashed for the

street, for after the exploit of the previous Saturday she was ready

to expect anything. Had he done so she would not have interfered; he

was really convalescent, and also the number of white stripes over

his face and hair had diminished. In the afternoon he reclined on the

Chesterfield to read, and fell asleep. Then it was that Rachel set out

upon her enterprise. She said not a word to Louis, but instructed Mrs.

Tams to inform the master, if he inquired, that she had gone over to

Knype to see Mr. Maldon.
"Are you a friend of Mester Maldon's?" asked the grey-haired slattern

who answered her summons at the door of Julian's lodgings in Granville

Street, Knype. There was a challenge in the woman's voice. Rachel

accepted it at once.
"Yes, I am," she said, with decision.
"Well, I don't know as I want any o' Mester Maldon's friends here,"

said the landlady loudly. "Mester Maldon's done a flit from here,

Mester Maldon has; and," coming out on to the pavement and pointing

upward to a broken pane in the first-floor window, "that's a bit o'

his fancy work afore he flitted!"
Rachel put her lips together.
"Can you give me his new address?"
"Can I give yer his new address? Pr'aps I can and pr'aps I canna,

but I dunna see why I should waste my breath on Mester Maldon's

friends—that I dunna! And I wunna!"
Rachel walked away. Before she reached the end of the frowsy street,

whose meanness and monotony of tiny-bow-windows exemplified intensely

the most deplorable characteristics of a district where brutish

licence is decreasing, she was overtaken by a lanky girl in a

pinafore.
"If ye please, miss, Mester Maldon's gone to live at 29 Birches

Street, 'anbridge."
Having made this announcement, the girl ran off, with a short giggle.
Rachel, had to walk half a mile to reach the tram-route. This

re-visiting of her native town, which she had quitted only a few weeks

earlier, seemed to her like the sad resumption of an existence

long forgotten. She was self-conscious and hoped that she would not

encounter the curiosity of any of her Knype acquaintances. She felt

easier when she was within the sheltering car and rumbling and jerking

through the gloomy carnival of Easter Saturday afternoon in Knype and

Cauldon on the way to Hanbridge.
After leaving the car in Crown Square, she had to climb through all

the western quarter of Hanbridge to the very edge of the town, on the

hummock that separates it from the Axe Moorlands. Birches Street, as

she had guessed, was in the suburb known as Birches Pike. It ran

right to the top of the hill, and the upper portion consisted of new

cottage-houses in groups of two or three, with vacant lots between.

Why should Julian have chosen Birches Street for residence, seeing

that his business was in Knype? It was a repellent street; it was out

even of the little world where sordidness is at any rate dignified

by tradition and anaemic ideals can support each other in close

companionship. It had neither a past nor a future. The steep end of

it was an horizon of cloud. The April east wind blew the smoke of

Hanbridge right across it.
In this east wind men in shirt-sleeves, and women with aprons over

their heads, stood nonchalantly at cottage gates contemplating the

vacuum of leisure. On two different parcels of land teams of shrieking

boys were playing football, with piles of caps and jackets to serve as

goal-posts. To the left, in a clough, was an enormous yellow marlpit,

with pools of water in its depths, and gangways of planks along them,

and a few overturned wheelbarrows lying here and there. A group of men

drove at full speed up the street in a dogcart behind a sweating cob,

stopped violently at the summit, and, taking watches from pockets,

began to let pigeons out of baskets. The pigeons rose in wide circles

and were lost in the vast dome of melancholy that hung over the

district.

II
No. 29 was the second house from the top, new, and already in decay.

It and its attached twin were named "Prospect Villas" in vermilion

tiles on the yellowish-red bricks of the façade. Hot, and yet chilled

by the wind, Rachel hesitated a moment at the gate, suddenly realizing

the perils of her mission. And then she saw Julian Maldon standing in

the bay-window of the ground floor; he was eating. Simultaneously he

recognized her.
She thought, "I can't go back now."
He came sheepishly to the front door and asked her to walk in.
"Who'd have thought of seeing you?" he exclaimed. "You must take me as

I am. I've only just moved in."
"I've been to your old address," she said, smiling, with an attempt at

animation.
"A rare row I had there!" he murmured.
She understood, with a pang of compassion and yet with feminine

disdain, the horrible thing that his daily existence was. No wonder he

would never allow Mrs. Maldon to go and see him! The spectacle of his

secret squalor would have desolated the old lady.
"Don't take any notice of all this," he said apologetically, as he

preceded her into the room where she had seen him standing. "I'm not

straight yet.... Not that it matters. By the way, take a seat, will

you?"
Rachel courageously sat down.
Just as there were no curtains to the windows, so there was no carpet

on the planked floor. A few pieces of new, cheap, ignoble furniture

half filled the room. In one corner was a sofa-bedstead covered with

an army blanket, in the middle a crimson-legged deal table, partly

covered with a dirty cloth, and on the cloth were several apples, an

orange, and a hunk of brown bread—his meal. Although he had only just

"moved in," dust had had time to settle thickly on all the furniture.

No pictures of any kind hid the huge sunflower that made the pattern

of the wall-paper. In the hearth, which lacked a fender, a small fire

was expiring.
"Ye see," said Julian, "I only eat when I'm hungry. It's a good plan.

So I'm eating now. I've turned vegetarian. There's naught like it.

I've chucked all that guzzling an swilling business. It's no good. I

never touch a drop of liquor, nor a morsel of fleshmeat. Nor smoke,

either. When you come to think of it, smoking's a disgusting habit."
Rachel said, pleasantly, "But you were smoking last week, surely?"
"Ah! But it's since then. I don't mind telling you. In fact, I meant

to tell you, anyhow. I've turned over a new leaf. And it wasn't too

soon. I've joined the Knype Ethical Society. So there you are!" His

voice grew defiant and fierce, as in the past, and he proceeded with

his meal.
Rachel knew nothing of the Knype Ethical Society, except that in

spite of its name it was regarded with unfriendly suspicion by the

respectable as an illicit rival of churches and chapels and a haunt of

dubious characters who, under high-sounding mottoes, were engaged in

the wicked scheme of setting class against class. She had accepted

the general verdict on the Knype Ethical Society. And now she was

confirmed in it. As she gazed at Julian Maldon in that dreadful

interior, chewing apples and brown bread and sucking oranges, only

when he felt hungry, she loathed the Knype Ethical Society. It was

nothing to her that the Knype Ethical Society was responsible for a

religious and majestic act in Julian Maldon—the act of turning over a

new leaf.
"And why did you come up here?"
"Oh, various reasons!" said Julian, with a certain fictitious

nonchalance, beneath which was all his old ferocious domination.

"You see, I didn't get enough exercise before. Lived too close to the

works. In fact, a silly existence. I saw it all plain enough as soon

as I got back from South Africa.... Exercise! What you want is for

your skin to act at least once every day. Don't you think so?" He

seemed to be appealing to her for moral support in some revolutionary

theory.
"Well—I'm sure I don't know."
Julian continued—
"If you ask me, I believe there are some people who never perspire

from one year's end to another. Never! How can they expect to be well?

How can they expect even to be clean? The pores, you know. I've been

reading a lot about it. Well, I walk up here from Knype full speed

every day. Everybody ought to do it. Then I have a bath."
"Oh! Is there a bathroom?"
"No, there isn't," he answered curtly. Then in a tone of apology: "But

I manage. You see, I'm going to save. I was spending too much

down there—furnished rooms. Here I took two rooms—this one and a

kitchen—unfurnished; very much cheaper, of course. I've just fixed

them up temporarily. Little by little they'll be improved. The woman

upstairs comes in for half an hour in the morning and just cleans up

when I'm gone."
"And does your cooking?"
"Not much!" said Julian bravely. "I do that myself. In the first

place, I want very little cooking. Cooking's not natural. And what

bit I do want—well, I have my own ideas about it, I've got a little

pamphlet about rational eating and cooking. You might read it.

Everybody ought to read it."
"I suppose all that sort of thing's very interesting," Rachel remarked

at large, with politeness.
"It is," Julian said emphatically.
Neither of them felt the necessity of defining what was meant by "all

that sort of thing." The phrase had been used with intention and was

perfectly understood.
"But if you want to know what I really came up here for," Julian

resumed, "I'll show you."
"Where?"
"Outside." And he repeated, "I'll show you."

III
She followed him as, bareheaded, he hurried out of the room into the

street.
"Shan't you take cold without anything on your head in this wind?" she

suggested mildly.
He would have snapped off the entire head of any other person who had

ventured to make the suggestion. But he treated Rachel more gently

because he happened to think that she was the only truly sensible and

kind woman he had ever met in his life.
"No fear!" he muttered.
At the front gate he stopped and looked back at his bay-window.
"Now—curtains!" he said. "I won't have curtains. Blinds, at night,

yes, if you like. But curtains! I never could see any use in curtains.

Fallals! Keep the light out! Dust-traps!"
Rachel gazed at him. Despite his beard, he appeared to her as a big

schoolboy, blundering about in the world, a sort of leviathan puppy in

earnest. She liked him, on account of an occasional wistful expression

in his eyes, and because she had been kind to him during his fearful

visit to Bycars. She even admired him, for his cruel honesty and

force. At the same time, he excited her compassion to an acute degree.

As she gazed at him the tears were ready to start from her eyes. What

she had seen, and what she had heard of the new existence which he was

organizing for himself made her feel sick with pity. But mingled

with her pity was a sharp disdain. The idea of Julian talking about

cleanliness, dust-traps, and rationality gave her a desire to laugh

and cry at once. All the stolid and yet wary conservatism of her

character revolted against meals at odd hours, brown bread, apples,

orange-sucking, action of the skin, male cooking, camp-beds, the

frowsiness of casual charwomen, bare heads, and especially bare

windows. If Rachel had been absolutely free to civilize Julian's life,

she would have begun by measuring the bay-window.
She said firmly—
"I must say I don't agree with you about curtains."
His gestures of impatience were almost violent; but she would not

flinch.
"Don't ye?"
"No."
"Straight?"
She nodded.
He drew breath. "Well, I'll get some—if it'll satisfy you."
His surrender was intensely dramatic to her. It filled her with

happiness, with a consciousness of immense power. She thought: "I can

influence him. I alone can influence him. Unless I look after

him his existence will be dreadful—dreadful."
"You'd much better let me buy them for you." She smiled persuasively.
"Have it your own way!" he said gloomily. "Just come along up here."
He led her up to the top of the street.
"Ye'll see what I live up here for," he muttered as they approached

the summit.
The other half of the world lay suddenly at their feet as they capped

the brow, but it was obscured by mist and cloud. The ragged downward

road was lost in the middle distance amid vaporous grey-greens and

earthy browns.
"No go!" he exclaimed crossly. "Not clear enough! But on a fine day ye

can see Axe and Axe Edge.... Finest view in the Five Towns."
The shrill cries of the footballers reached them.
"What a pity!" she sympathized eagerly. "I'm sure it must be

splendid." His situation seemed extraordinarily tragic to her. His

short hair, ruffled by the keen wind, was just like a boy's hair and

somehow the sight of it touched her deeply.
He put his hands far into his pockets and drummed one foot on the

ground.
"What brought ye up here?" he demanded, with his eyes on an invisible

town of Axe.
She opened her hand-bag.
"I came to bring you this," she said, and offered him an envelope,

which he took, wonderingly.
Then, when he had it in his hands, he said abruptly, angrily, "If it's

that money, I won't take it."
"Yes you will."
"Has Louis sent ye?" This was the first mention of Louis, though he

was well aware of the accident.
She shook her head.
"Well, let him keep his half, and you can keep mine."
"It's all there."
"How—all there?"
"All that you left the other night."
"But—but—" He seemed to be furious as he faced her.
Rachel went on—
"The other part of the missing money's been found ... Louis had it. So

all this belongs to you. If some one hadn't told you it wouldn't have

been fair."
She flushed slowly, trembling, but looking at him.
"Well!" Julian burst out with savage solemnity, "there's not many of

your sort knocking about. By G—— there isn't!"
She walked quickly away from his passionate homage to her.
"Here!" he shouted, fingering the envelope.
But she kept on at a swift pace towards Hanbridge. About a quarter of

a mile down the road the pigeon-flyer's dogcart stood empty outside a

public-house.

CHAPTER XVI
THE LETTER

I
Rachel stood at her own front door and took off her glove in order

more easily to manipulate the latch-key, which somehow, since coming

into frequent use again, had never been the same manageable latch-key,

but a cantankerous old thing, though still very bright. She opened

the door quietly, and stepped inside quietly, lest by chance she might

disturb Louis, the invalid—but also because she was a little afraid.
The most contradictory feelings can exist together in the mind. After

the desolate discomfort of Julian Maldon's lodging and the spectacle

of his clumsiness in the important affair of mere living, Rachel

was conscious of a deep and proud happiness as she re-entered

the efficient, cosy, and gracious organism of her own home. But

simultaneously with this feeling of happiness she had a dreadful

general apprehension that the organism might soon be destroyed, and a

particular apprehension concerning her next interview with Louis, for

at the next interview she would be under the necessity of telling him

about her transaction with Julian. She had been absolutely determined

upon that transaction. She had said to herself, "Whatever happens, I

shall take that money to Julian and insist on his keeping all of

it." She had, in fact, been very brave—indeed, audacious. Now the

consequences were imminent, and they frightened her; she was less

brave now. One awkward detail of the immediate future was that to tell

Louis would be to reopen the entire question of the theft, which she

had several times in the most abrupt and arrogant manner refused to

discuss with him.
As soon as she had closed the front door she perceived that twilight

was already obscuring the interior of the house. But she could plainly

see that the parlour door was about two inches ajar, exactly as she

had left it a couple of hours earlier. Probably Louis had not stirred.

She listened vainly for a sign of life from him. Probably he was

reading, for on rare occasions when he read a novel he would stick

to the book with surprising pertinacity. At any rate, he would be

too lofty to give any sign that he had heard her return. Under less

sinister circumstances he might have yelled gaily: "I say, Rache!" for

in a teasing mood he would sometimes prefer "Rache" to "Louise."
Rachel from the lobby could see the fire bright in the kitchen, and

a trayful of things on the kitchen table ready to be brought into the

parlour for high tea.
Mrs. Tams was out. It was not among Mrs. Tams's regular privileges

to be out in the afternoon. But this was Easter Saturday—rather a

special day—and, further, one of her daughters had gone away for

Easter and left a child with one of her daughters-in-law, and

Mrs. Tams had desired to witness some of the dealings of her

daughter-in-law with her grandchild. Not without just pride had Mrs.

Tams related the present circumstances to Rachel. In Mrs. Tams's young

maturity parents who managed a day excursion to Blackpool in the year

did well, and those who went away for four or five days at Knype Wakes

in August were princes and plutocrats. But nowadays even a daughter

of Mrs. Tams, not satisfied with a week at Knype Wakes, could take a

week-end at Easter just like great folk such as Louis. Which proved

that the community at large, or Mrs. Tams's family, had famously got

up in the world. Rachel recalled Louis' suggestion, more than a week

earlier, of a trip to Llandudno. The very planet itself had aged since

then.
She looked at the clock. In twenty minutes Mrs. Tams would be back.

She and Louis were alone together in the house. She might go straight

into the parlour, and say, in as indifferent and ordinary a voice as

she could assume: "I've just been over to Julian Maldon's to give him

that money—all of it, you know," and thus get the affair finished

before Mrs. Tams's reappearance. Louis was within a few feet of her,

hidden only by the door which a push would cause to swing!... Yes, but

she could not persuade herself to push the door! The door seemed to

be protected from her hand by a mysterious spell which she dared not

break. She was, indeed, overwhelmed by the simple but tremendous fact

that Louis and herself were alone together in the darkening house. She

decided, pretending to be quite calm: "I'll just run upstairs and take

my things off first. There's no use in my seeming to be in a hurry."
In the bedroom she arranged her toilet for the evening, and

established order in every corner of the chamber. Under the washstand

lay the long row of Louis' boots and shoes, each pair in stretchers.

She suddenly contrasted Julian's heavy and arrogant dowdiness with the

nice dandyism of Louis. She could not help thinking that Julian

would be a terrible person to live with. This was the first thought

favourable to Louis which had flitted through her mind for a long

time. She dismissed it. Nothing in another man could be as terrible to

live with as the defects of Louis. She set herself—she was obliged to

set herself—high above Louis. The souvenir of the admiration of

old Batchgrew and John's Ernest, the touching humility before her

of Julian Maldon, once more inflated her self-esteem—it could not

possibly have failed to do so. She knew that she was an extraordinary

woman, and a prize.
Invigorated and reassured by these reflections, she descended proudly

to the ground floor. And then, hesitating at the entrance to the

parlour, she went into the kitchen and poked the fire. As the fire

was in excellent condition there was no reason for this act except her

diffidence at the prospect of an encounter with Louis. At last, having

examined the tea-tray and invented other delays, she tightened her

nerves and passed into the parlour to meet the man who seemed to be

waiting for her like the danger of a catastrophe. He was not there.

The parlour was empty. His book was lying on the Chesterfield.
She felt relieved. It was perhaps not very wise for him to have gone

out for a walk, but if he chose to run risks, he was free to do so,

for all she cared. In the meantime the interview was postponed; hence

her craven relief. She lit the gas, but not by the same device as in

Mrs. Maldon's day; and then she saw an envelope lying on the table.

It was addressed in Louis' handwriting to "Mrs. Louis Fores." She was

alone in the house. She felt sick. Why should he write a letter to her

and leave it there on the table? She invented half a dozen harmless

reasons for the letter, but none of them was the least convincing.

The mere aspect of the letter frightened her horribly. There was no

strength in her limbs. She tore the envelope in a daze.
The letter ran—
Dear Rachel,—I have decided to leave England. I do not know
how long I shall be away. I cannot and will not stand the life
I have been leading with you this last week. I had a perfectly
satisfactory explanation to give you, but you have most rudely
refused to listen to it. So now I shall not give it. I shall
write you as to my plans. I shall send you whatever money is
necessary for you. By the way, I put four hundred and fifty
pounds away in my private drawer. On looking for it this
afternoon I see that you have taken it, without saying a word
to me. You must account to me for this money. When you have
done so we will settle how much I am to send you. In the
meantime you can draw from it for necessary expenses.
Yours,
L.F.

II
Rachel stared at the letter. It was the first letter she had seen

written on the new note-paper, embossed with the address, "Bycars,

Bursley." Louis would not have "Bycars Lane" on the note-paper,

because "Bycars" alone was more vague and impressive; distant

strangers might take it to be the name of a magnificent property. Her

lips curled. She violently ripped the paper to bits and stuck them in

the fire; a few fragments escaped and fluttered like snow on to the

fender. She screwed up the envelope and flung it after the letter. Her

face smarted and tingled as the blood rushed passionately to her head.
She thought, aghast: "Everything is over! He will never come back.

He will never have enough moral force to come back. We haven't

been married two months, and everything is over! And this is Easter

Saturday! He wanted us to be at Llandudno or somewhere for Easter, and

I shouldn't be at all surprised if he's gone there. Yes, he would be

capable of that. And if it wasn't for the plaster on his face, he'd be

capable of gallivanting on Llandudno pier this very night!"
She had no illusion as to him. She saw him as objectively as a god

might have seen him.
And then she thought with fury: "Oh, what a fool I've been! What a

little fool! Why didn't I listen to him? Why didn't I foresee?... No,

I've not been a fool! I've not! I've not! What did I do wrong?

Nothing! I couldn't have borne his explanations!... Explanations,

indeed! I can imagine his explanations! Did he expect me to smile and

kiss him after he'd told me he was a thief?"
And then she thought, in reference to his desertion: "It's not true!

It can't be true!"
She wanted to read the letter again, so that perhaps she might

read something into it that was hopeful. But to read it again was

impossible. She tried to recall its exact terms, and could not. She

could only remember with certainty that the final words were "Yours,

L.F." Nevertheless, she knew that the thing was true; she knew by the

weight within her breast and the horrible nausea that almost overcame

her self-control.
She whispered, alone in the room—
"Yes, it's true! And it's happened to me!... He's gone!"
And not the ruin of her life, but the scandal of the affair, was the

first matter that occupied her mind. She was too shaken yet to feel

the full disaster. Her mind ran on little things. And just as once

she had pictured herself self-conscious in the streets of Bursley as

a young widow, so now she pictured herself in the far more appalling

role of deserted wife. The scandal would be enormous. Nothing—no

carefully invented fiction—would suffice to stifle it. She would

never dare to show her face. She would be compelled to leave the

district. And supposing a child came! Fears stabbed her. She felt

tragically helpless as she stood there, facing a vision of future

terrors. She had legal rights, of course. Her common sense told her

that. She remembered also that she possessed a father and a brother in

America. But no legal rights and no relatives would avail against

the mere simple, negligent irresponsibility of Louis. In the end, she

would have to rely on herself. All at once she recollected that she

had promised to see after Julian's curtains.
She had almost no money. And how could the admiration of three men

other than her husband (so enheartening a few minutes earlier) serve

her in the crisis? No amount of masculine admiration could mitigate

the crudity of the fact that she had almost no money. Louis' illness

had interrupted the normal course of domestic finance—if, indeed, a

course could be called normal which had scarcely begun. Louis had

not been to the works. Hence he had received no salary. And how much

salary was due to him, and whether he was paid weekly or monthly, she

knew not. Neither did she know whether his inheritance actually had

been paid over to him by Thomas Batchgrew.
What she knew was that she had received no house-keeping allowance for

more than a week, and that her recent payments to tradesmen had been

made from a very small remaining supply of her own prenuptial money.

Economically she was as dependent on Louis as a dog, and not more so;

she had the dog's right to go forth and pick up a living.... Of course

Louis would send her money. Louis was a gentleman—he was not a cad.

Yes, but he was a very careless gentleman. She was once again filled

with the bitter realization of his extreme irresponsibility.
She heard a noise in the back lobby, and started. It was Mrs. Tams,

returned. Mrs. Tams had a key of her own, of which she was proud—an

affair of about four inches in length and weighing over a quarter of a

pound. It fitted the scullery door, and was, indeed, the very key with

which Rachel had embroidered her lie to Thomas Batchgrew on the day

after the robbery. Mrs. Tams always took pleasure in entering the

house from the rear, without a sound. She was now coming into the

parlour with the tray for high tea. No wonder that Rachel started.

Here was the first onset of the outer world.
Mrs. Tams came in, already perfectly transformed from a mother,

mother-in-law, and grandmother into a parlour-maid with no human tie.
"Good-afternoon, Mrs. Tams."
"So ye've got back, ma'am!"
While Mrs. Tams laid the table, with many grunts and creakings of the

solid iron in her stays, Rachel sat on a chair by the fire, trying to

seem in a casual, dreamy mood, cogitating upon what she must say.
"Will mester be down for tea, ma'am?" asked Mrs. Tams, who had

excusably assumed that Louis was upstairs.
And Rachel, forced now to defend, instead of attacking, blurted out—
"Oh! By the way, I was forgetting; Mr. Fores will not be in for tea."
Mrs. Tams, forgetting she was a parlour-maid, vociferated in amazement

and protest—
"Not be in for tea, ma'am? And him as he is!" All her lately gathering

suspicions were strengthened and multiplied.
Rachel had to continue as she had begun: "He's been called away on

very urgent business. He simply had to go."
Mrs. Tams, intermitting her duties, stood still and gazed at Rachel.
"Was it far, ma'am, as he had for to go?"
A simple question, and yet how difficult to answer plausibly!
"Yes—rather."
"I suppose he'll be back to-night, ma'am?"
"Oh yes, of course!" replied Rachel, in absurd haste. "But if he

isn't, I'm not to worry, he said. But he fully expects to be. We

scarcely had time to talk, you see. He was getting ready when I came

in."
"A telegram, ma'am, I suppose it was?"
"Yes.... That is, I don't know whether there was a telegram first, or

not. But he was called for, you see. A cab. I couldn't have let him go

off walking, not as he is."
Mrs. Tarns gave a gesture.
"I suppose I mun alter this 'ere table, then," said she, putting a cup

and saucer back on the tray.
"Idiot! Idiot!" Rachel described herself to herself, when Mrs.

Tams, very much troubled, had left the room. "'By the way, I was

forgetting'—couldn't I have told her better than that? She's known

for a week that there's been something wrong, and now she's certainly

guessed there's something dreadfully wrong.... Just look at all the

silly lies I've told already! What will it be like to-morrow—and

Monday? I wonder what my face looked like while I was telling her!"
She rushed upstairs to discover what luggage Louis had taken with him.

But apparently he had taken nothing whatever. The trunk, the valise,

and the various bags were all stacked in the empty attic, exactly as

she had placed them. He must have gone off in a moment, without any

reflection or preparation.
And when Mrs. Tams served the solitary tea, Rachel was just as idiotic

as before.
"By the way, Mrs. Tams," she began again, "did you happen to tell Mr.

Fores where I'd gone this afternoon?... You see, we'd no opportunity

to discuss anything," she added, striving once more after

verisimilitude.
"Yes'm. I told him when I took him his early cup o' tea."
"Did he ask you?"
"Now ye puzzle me, ma'am! I couldn't swear to it to save my life. But

I told him."
"What did he say?" Rachel tried to smile.
"He didna say aught."
Rachel remained alone, to objurgate Rachel. It was indeed only too

obvious from Mrs. Tams's constrained and fussy demeanour that the

old woman had divined the existence of serious trouble in the Fores

household.

III
Some time after the empty ceremony of tea, Rachel sat in state in the

parlour, dignified, self-controlled, pretending to sew, as she had

pretended to eat and drink and, afterwards, to have an important

enterprise of classifying and rearranging her possessions in the

wardrobe upstairs. Let Mrs. Tams enter ever so unexpectedly, Rachel

was a fit spectacle for her, with a new work-basket by her side on the

table, and her feet primly on a footstool, quite in the style of the

late Mrs. Maldon, and a serious and sagacious look on her face that

the fire and the gas combined to illuminate. She did not actually sew,

but the threaded needle was ready in her hand to move convincingly

at a second's notice, for Mrs. Tams was of a restless and inquisitive

disposition that night.
Apparently secure between the drawn blinds, the fire, the

Chesterfield, and the sideboard, Rachel was nevertheless ranging wide

among vast, desolate tracts of experience, and she was making singular

discoveries. For example, it was not until she was alone in the

parlour after tea that she discovered that during the whole of her

interview with Julian Maldon in the afternoon she had never regarded

him as a thief. And yet he was a thief—just as much as Louis! She had

simply forgotten that he was a thief. He did not seem to be any the

worse for being a thief. If he had shown the desire to explain to her

by word of mouth the entire psychology of his theft, she would have

listened with patience and sympathy; she would have encouraged him to

rectitude. And yet Julian had no claim on her; he was not her husband;

she did not love him. But because Louis was her husband, and had

a claim on her, and had received all the proofs of her

affection—therefore, she must be merciless for Louis! She perceived

the inconsistency; she perceived it with painful clearness. She had

the impartial logic of the self-accuser. At intervals the self-accuser

was flagellated and put to flight by passionate reaction, but only to

return stealthily and irresistibly....
She had been wrong to take the four hundred and fifty pounds without a

word. True, Louis had somewhat casually authorized her to return half

of the sum to Julian, but the half was not the whole. And in any case

she ought to have told Louis of her project. There could be no doubt

that, immediately upon Mrs. Tams's going out, Louis had looked for

the four hundred and fifty pounds, and, in swift resentment at its

disappearance, had determined to disappear also. He had been stung and

stung again, past bearing (she argued) daily and hourly throughout

the week, and the disappearance of the money had put an end to his

patience. Such was the upshot, and she had brought it about!
She had imagined that she was waiting for destiny, but in fact she had

been making destiny all the time, with her steely glances at Louis and

her acrid, uncompromising tongue!... And did those other men really

admire her? How, for instance, could Thomas Batchgrew admire her,

seeing that he had suspected her of lies and concealment about the

robbery? If it was on account of supposed lies and concealment that he

admired her, then she rejected Thomas Batchgrew's admiration....
The self-accuser and the self-depreciator in her grew so strong that

Louis' conduct soon became unexceptionable—save for a minor point

concerning a theft of some five hundred pounds odd from an old lady.

And as for herself, she, Rachel, was an over-righteous prig, an

interfering person, a blundering fool of a woman, a cruel-hearted

creature. And Louis was just a poor, polite martyr who had had the

misfortune to pick up certain bank-notes that were not his.
Then the tide of judgment would sweep back, and Rachel was the

innocent, righteous martyr again, and Louis the villain. But not for

long.
She cried passionately within her brain: "I must have him. I must get

hold of him. I must!"
But when the brief fury of longing was exhausted she would ask: "How

can I get hold of him? Where is he?" Then more forcibly: "What am I to

do first? Yes, what ought I to do? What is wisest? He little guesses

that he is killing me. If he had guessed, he wouldn't have done it.

But nothing will kill me! I am as strong as a horse. I shall live for

ages. There's the worst of it all!... And it's no use asking what I

ought to do, either, because nothing, nothing, nothing would induce me

to run after him, even if I knew where to run to! I would die first. I

would live for a hundred years in torture first. That's positive."
The hands of the clock, instead of moving slowly, seemed to progress

at a prodigious rate. Mrs. Tams came in—
"Shall I lay mester's supper, ma'am?"
The idea of laying supper for the master had naturally not occurred to

Rachel.
"Yes, please."
When the supper was laid upon one half of the table, the sight of it

almost persuaded Rachel that Louis would be bound to come—as though

the waiting supper must mysteriously magnetize him out of the world

beyond into the intimacy of the parlour.
And she thought, as she strove for the hundredth time to recall the

phrases of the letter—
"'Perfectly satisfactory explanation!' suppose he has got a

perfectly satisfactory explanation! He must have. He must have. If

only he has, everything would be all right. I'd apologize. I'd almost

go on my knees to him.... And he was so ill all the time, too!... But

he's gone. It's too late now for the explanation. Still, as soon as I

hear from him, I shall write and ask him for it."
And in her mind she began to compose a wondrous letter to him—a

letter that should preserve her own dignity while salving his, a

letter that should overwhelm him with esteem for her.
She rang the bell. "Don't sit up, Mrs. Tams."
And when she had satisfied herself that Mrs. Tams with unwilling

obedience had retired upstairs, she began to walk madly about

the parlour (which had an appearance at once very strange and

distressingly familiar), and to whisper plaintively, and raging, and

plaintively again: "I must get him back. I cannot bear this. It is too

much for me. I must get him back. It's all my fault!" and then

dropped on the Chesterfield in a collapse, moaning: "No. It's no use

now."
And then she fancied that she heard the gate creak, and a latch-key

fumbling into the keyhole of the front door. And one part of her brain

said on behalf of the rest: "I am mad. I am delirious."
It was a fact that Louis had caused to be manufactured for his own use

a new latch-key. But it was impossible that this latch-key should now

be in the keyhole. She was delirious. And then she unmistakably

heard the front door open. Her heart jumped with the most afflicting

violence. She was ready to fall on to the carpet, but seemed to be

suspended in the air. When she recognized Louis' footsteps in the

lobby tears burst from her eyes in an impetuous torrent.

CHAPTER XVII
IN THE MONASTERY

I
When Mrs. Tams brought in his early cup of tea that Easter Saturday

afternoon, Louis had no project whatever in his head, and he was

excessively, exasperatingly bored. A quarter of an hour earlier he had

finished reading the novel which had been mitigating the worst

tedium of his shamed convalescence, and the state of his mind was not

improved by the fact that in his opinion the author of the novel had

failed to fulfil clear promises—had, in fact, abused his trust. On

the other hand, he felt very appreciably stronger, and his self-esteem

was heightened by the complete correctness of his toilet. On that

morning he had dressed himself with art and care for the first time

since the accident. He enjoyed a little dandyism; dandified, he was a

better man; the "fall" of a pair of trousers over the knee, the gloss

of white wristbands, just showing beneath the new cloth of a well-cut

sleeve—these phenomena not only pleased him but gave him confidence.

And herein was the sole bright spot of his universe when Mrs. Tams

entered.
He was rather curt with Mrs. Tams because she was two minutes late;

for two endless minutes he had been cultivating the resentment of a

man neglected and forgotten by every one of those whose business in

life it is to succour, humour, and soothe him.
Mrs. Tams comprehended his mood with precision, and instantly. She

hovered round him like a hen, indeed like a whole flock of hens, and

when he savagely rebuffed her she developed from a flock of hens into

a flight of angels.
"Missis said as I was to tell you as she'd gone to see Mr. Julian

Maldon, sir," said Mrs. Tams, in the way of general gossip.
Louis made no sign.
"Her didna say how soon her'd be back. I was for going out, sir, but

I'll stop in, sir, and willing—"
"What time are you supposed to go out?" Louis demanded, in a tone less

inimical than his countenance.
"By rights, now, sir," said Mrs. Tams, looking backward through the

open door at the lobby clock.
"Well," Louis remarked with liveliness, "if you aren't outside this

house in one minute, in sixty seconds, I shall put you out, neck and

crop."
Mrs. Tams smiled. His amiability was returning, he had done her the

honour to tease her. She departed, all her "things" being ready in the

kitchen. Even before she had gone Louis went quickly upstairs, having

drunk less than half a cup of tea, and with extraordinary eagerness

plunged into the bedroom and unlocked his private drawer. He both

hoped and feared that the money which he had bestowed there after

Julian's historic visit would have vanished. It had vanished.
The shock was unpleasant, but the discovery itself had a pleasant

side, because it justified the theory which had sprung complete into

his mind when he learnt where Rachel had gone, and also because it

denuded Rachel of all reasonable claim to consideration. He had

said to himself: "She has gone off to return half of that money to

Julian—that's what it is. And she's capable of returning all of it to

him!" ... And she had done so. And she had not consulted him, Louis.

He, then, was a nobody—zero in the house! She had deliberately

filched the money from him, and to accomplish her purpose she had

abstracted his keys, which he had left in his pocket. She must have

stolen the notes several days before, perhaps a week before, when he

was really seriously ill. She had used the keys and restored them to

his pocket. Astounding baseness!
He murmured: "This finishes it. This really does finish it."
He was immensely righteous as he stood alone in the bedroom in front

of the rifled drawer. He was more than righteous—he was a martyr. He

had done absolutely nothing that was wrong. He had not stolen money;

he had not meant to steal; the more he examined his conduct, the more

he was convinced that it had been throughout unexceptionable, whereas

the conduct of Rachel ...! At every point she had sinned. It was she,

not he, who had burnt Mrs. Maldon's hoard. Was it not monstrous that a

woman should be so careless as to light a fire without noticing that

a bundle of notes lay on the top of the coal? Besides, what affair

was it of hers, anyway? It concerned himself, Mrs. Maldon, and Julian,

alone. But she must needs interfere. She had not a penny to bless

herself with, but he had magnanimously married her; and his reward was

her inexcusable interference in his private business.
His accident was due solely to his benevolence for her. If he had not

been wheeling a bicycle procured for her, and on his way to buy her a

new bicycle, the accident would never have occurred. But had she shown

any gratitude? None. It was true that he had vaguely authorized her to

return half of the money replaced by the contrite Julian; but no date

for doing so had been fixed, and assuredly she had no pretext whatever

for dealing with all of it. That she should go to Julian Maldon with

either the half or the whole of the money without previously informing

him and obtaining the ratification of his permission was simply

scandalous. And that she should sneakingly search his pockets for

keys, commit a burglary in his drawer, and sneakingly put the keys

back was outrageous, infamous, utterly intolerable.
He said, "I'll teach you a lesson, my lady, once for all."
Then he went downstairs. The kitchen was empty; Mrs. Tams had gone.

But between the kitchen and the parlour he changed his course, and ran

upstairs again to the drawer, which he pulled wide open. At the back

of it there ought to have been an envelope containing twenty pounds in

notes, balance of an advance payment from old Batchgrew. The envelope

was there with its contents. Rachel had left the envelope. "Good of

her!" he ejaculated with sarcasm. He put the money in his pocket-book,

and descended to finish his tea, which he drank up excitedly.
A dubious scheme was hypnotizing him. He was a man well acquainted

with the hypnotism of dubious schemes. He knew all the symptoms.

He fought against the magic influence, and then, as always, yielded

himself deliberately and voluptuously to it. He would go away. He

would not wait; he would go at once, in a moment. She deserved as

much, if not more. He knew not where he should go; a thousand reasons

against going assailed him; but he would go. He must go. He could no

longer stand, even for a single hour, her harshness, her air of moral

superiority, her adamantine obstinacy. He missed terribly her candid

worship of him, to which he had grown accustomed and which had become

nearly a necessity of his existence. He could not live with an eternal

critic; the prospect was totally inconceivable. He wanted love, and he

wanted admiring love, and without it marriage was meaningless to him,

a mere imprisonment.
So he would go. He could not and would not pack; to pack would

distress him and bore him; he would go as he was. He could buy what

he needed. The shops—his kind of shops—were closed, and would remain

closed until Tuesday. Nevertheless, he would go. He could buy the

indispensable at Faulkner's establishment on the platform at Knype

railway-station, conveniently opposite the Five Towns Hotel. He

had determined to go to the Five Towns Hotel that night. He had no

immediate resources beyond the twenty pounds, but he would telegraph

to Batchgrew, who ad not yet transferred to him the inheritance, to

pay money into his bank early on Tuesday; if he were compelled to

draw a cheque he would cross it, and then it could not possibly be

presented before Wednesday morning.
At all costs he would go. His face was still plastered; but he would

go, and he would go far, no matter where! The chief thing was to go.

The world was calling him. The magic of the dubious scheme held him

fast. And in all other respects he was free—free as impulse. He would

go. He was not yet quite recovered, not quite strong.... Yes, he was

all right; he was very strong! And he would go.
He put on his hat and his spring overcoat. Then he thought of the

propriety of leaving a letter behind him—not for Rachel's sake, but

to insist on his own dignity and to spoil hers. He wrote the letter,

read it through with satisfaction, and quitted the house, shutting the

door cheerfully, but with a trembling hand. Lest he might meet Rachel

on her way home he went up the lane instead of down, and, finding

himself near the station, took a train to Knype—travelling first

class. The glorious estate of a bachelor was his once more.

II
The Five Towns Hotel stood theoretically in the borough of Hanbridge,

but in fact it was in neither Hanbridge nor Knype, but "opposite Knype

station," on the quiet side of Knype station, far away from any urban

traffic; the gross roar of the electric trams running between Knype

and Hanbridge could not be heard from the great portico of the hotel.

It is true that the hotel primarily existed on its proximity to the

railway centre of the Five Towns. But it had outgrown its historic

origin, and would have moderately flourished even had the North

Staffordshire railway been annihilated. By its sober grandeur and its

excellent cooking it had taken its place as the first hotel in the

district. It had actually no rival. Heroic, sublime efforts had been

made in the centre of Hanbridge to overthrow the pre-eminence of

the Five Towns Hotel. The forlorn result of one of these efforts—so

immense was it!—had been bought by the municipality and turned into a

Town Hall—supreme instance of the Five Towns' habit of "making things

do!" No effort succeeded. Men would still travel from the ends of the

Five Towns to the bar, the billiard-rooms, the banqueting-halls of the

Five Towns Hotel, where every public or semi-public ceremonial that

included conviviality was obliged to happen if it truly respected

itself.
The Five Towns Hotel had made fortunes, and still made them. It was

large and imposing and sombre. The architect, who knew his business,

had designed staircases, corridors, and accidental alcoves on the

scale of a palace; so that privacy amid publicity could always be

found within its walls. It was superficially old-fashioned, and in

reality modern. It had a genuine chef, with sub-chefs, good waiters

whose sole weakness was linguistic, and an apartment of carven oak

with a vast counterfeit eye that looked down on you from the ceiling.

It was ready for anything—a reception to celebrate the nuptials of

a maid, a lunch to a Cabinet Minister with an axe to grind in the

district, or a sale by auction of house-property with wine ad

libitum to encourage bids.
But its chief social use was perhaps as a retreat for men who were

tired of a world inhabited by two sexes. Sundry of the great hotels

of Britain have forgotten this ancient function, and are as full of

frills, laces, colour, and soft giggles as a London restaurant, so

that in Manchester, Liverpool, and Glasgow a man in these days has

no safe retreat except the gloominess of a provincial club. The Five

Towns Hotel has held fast to old tradition in this respect. Ladies

were certainly now and then to be seen there, for it was a hotel and

as such enjoyed much custom. But in the main it resembled a monastery.

Men breathed with a new freedom as they entered it. Commandments

reigned there, and their authority was enforced; but they were

not precisely the tables of Moses. The enormous pretence which men

practise for the true benefit of women was abandoned in the Five Towns

Hotel. Domestic sultans who never joked in the drawing-room would

crack with laughter in the Five Towns Hotel, and make others crack,

too. Old men would meet young men on equal terms, and feel rather

pleased at their own ability to do so. And young men shed their youth

there, displaying the huge stock of wisdom and sharp cynicism which by

hard work they had acquired in an incredibly short time. Indeed, the

hotel was a wonderful institution, and a source of satisfaction to

half a county.

III
It was almost as one returned from the dead that Louis Fores entered

the Five Towns Hotel on Easter Saturday afternoon, for in his celibate

prime he had been a habitué of the place. He had a thrill; and he knew

that he would be noticed, were it only as the hero and victim of a

street accident; a few remaining plasters still drew attention to his

recent history. At the same time, the thrill which affected him was

not entirely pleasurable, for he was frightened by what he had done:

by the letter written to Rachel, by his abandonment of her, and also

by the prospect of what he meant to do. The resulting situation would

certainly be scandalous in a high degree, and tongues would dwell

on the extreme brevity of the period of marriage. The scandal would

resound mightily. And Louis hated scandal, and had always had a

genuine desire for respectability.... Then he reassured himself.

"Pooh! What do I care?" Besides, it was not his fault. He was utterly

blameless; Rachel alone was the sinner. She had brought disaster upon

herself. On the previous Saturday he had given her fair warning by

getting up out of bed in his weakness and leaving the house—more from

instinct than from any set plan. But she would not take a hint. She

would not learn. Very good! The thought of his inheritance and of his

freedom uplifted him till he became nearly a god.
Owing to the Easter holidays the hotel was less bright and worldly

than usual. Moreover, Saturday was never one of its brilliant days of

the week. In the twilight of a subsidiary lounge, illuminated by one

early electric spark, a waiter stood alone amid great basket-chairs

and wicker-tables. Louis knew the waiter, as did every man-about-town;

but Louis imagined that he knew him better than most; the waiter gave

a similar impression to all impressionable young men.
"How do you do, Krupp!" Louis greeted him, with kind familiarity.
"Good afternoon, sir."
It was perhaps the hazard of his name that had given the waiter

a singular prestige in the district. Krupp is a great and an

unforgettable name, wherever you go. And also it offers people a

chance to be jocose with facility. A hundred habitué's had made the

same joke to Krupp about Krupp's name, and each had supposed himself

to be humorous in an original manner. Krupp received the jocularities

with the enigmatic good-fellow air with which he received everything.

None knew whether Krupp admired or disdained, loved or hated, the Five

Towns and the English character. He was a foreigner from some vague

frontier of Switzerland, possessing no language of his own but a

patois, and speaking other languages less than perfectly. He had been

a figure in the Five Towns Hotel for over twenty years. He was an

efficient waiter; yet he had never risen on the staff, and was still

just the lounge or billiard-room waiter that he had always been—and

apparently content with Destiny.
Louis asked brusquely, as one who had no time to waste, "Will

Faulkner's be open?"
Krupp bent down and glanced through an interstice of a partition at a

clock in the corridor.
"Yes, sir," said Krupp with calm certainty.
Louis, pleased, thought, "This man is a fine waiter." Somehow Krupp

made it seem as if by the force of his will he had forced Faulkner's

to be open—in order to oblige Mr. Fores.
"Because," said Louis casually, "I've no luggage, not a rag, and I

want to buy a few things, and no other place'll be open."
"Yes, sir," said Krupp, mysterious and quite incurious. He did not

even ask, "Do you wish a room, sir?"
"Heard about my accident, I suppose?" Louis went on, a little

surprised that Krupp should make no sympathetic reference to his

plasters.
Krupp became instantly sympathetic, yet keeping his customary reserve.
"Yes, sir. And I am pleased to see you are recovered," he said, with

the faint, indefinable foreign accent and the lack of idiom which

combined to deprive his remarks of any human quality.
"Well," said Louis, not quite prepared to admit that the affair had

gone so smoothly as Krupp appeared to imply, "I can tell you I've

had a pretty bad time. I really ought not to be here now, but—" He

stopped.
"Strange it should happen to you, sir. A gentleman who was in here

the other day said that in his opinion you were one of the cleverest

cyclists in the Five Towns."
Louis naturally inquired, "Who was that?"
"I could not say, sir. Not one of our regular customers, sir," with a

touch of mild depreciation. "A dark gentleman, with a beard, a little

lame, I fancy." As Krupp had invented the gentleman and his opinion

to meet the occasion, he was right in depriving him of the rank of a

regular customer.
"Oh!" murmured Louis. "By the way, has Mr. Gibbs come yet?"
"Mr. Gibbs, sir?"
"Yes, an American. I have an appointment with him this afternoon. If

he comes in while I am over at Faulkner's just tell him, will you? I

think he's stopping at the Majestic."
The Majestic being the latest rival hotel at Hanbridge, Krupp raised

his eyebrows in a peculiar way and nodded his head.
Just as Krupp had invented a gentleman, so now Louis was inventing

one. Neither Krupp nor Louis guessed the inventive act of the other.

Krupp's act was a caprice, a piece of embroidery, charming and

unnecessary. But Louis was inventing with serious intent, for he had

to make his presence at the Five Towns Hotel on Easter Saturday seem

natural and inevitable.
"And also I want the Cunard list of sailings, and the White Star, too.

There's a Cunard boat from Liverpool on Monday, isn't there?"
"I don't think so, sir," said Krupp, "but I'll see."
"I understood from Mr. Gibbs there was. And I'm going to Liverpool by

that early train to-morrow."
"Sunday, sir?"
"Yes, I must be in Liverpool to-morrow night."
Louis went across to the station to Faulkner's. He considered that

he was doing very well. And after all, why not go to America—not on

Monday, for he was quite aware that no boat left on Monday—but in a

few days, after he had received the whole sum that Thomas Batchgrew

held for him. He could quite plausibly depart on urgent business

connected with new capitalistic projects. He could quite plausibly

remain in America as long as convenient. America beckoned to him. He

remembered all the appetizing accounts that he had ever heard

from American commercial travellers of Broadway and Fifth

Avenue—incredible streets. In America he might treble, quadruple, his

already vast capital. The romance of the idea intoxicated him.

IV
When he got back from Faulkner's with a parcel (which he threw to the

cloak-room attendant to keep) he felt startlingly hungry, and, despite

the early hour, he ordered a steak in the grill-room; and not a steak

merely, but all the accoutrements of a steak, with beverages to match.

And to be on the safe side he paid for the meal at once, with a cheque

for ten pounds, receiving the change in gold and silver, and thus

increasing his available cash to about thirty pounds. Then in the

lounge, with Cuban cigar-smoke in his eyes, and Krupp discoursing to

him of all conceivable Atlantic liners, he wrote a letter to Thomas

Batchgrew and marked it "Very urgent"—which was simple prudence on

his part, for he had drawn a cheque for ten pounds on a non-existent

bank-balance. At last, as Mr. Gibbs had not arrived, he said he should

stroll up to the Majestic. He had not yet engaged a room; he seemed to

hesitate before that decisive act....
Then it was that, in the corridor immediately outside the lounge, he

encountered Jim Horrocleave. The look in Jim Horrocleave's ferocious

eye shocked him. Louis had almost forgotten his employer, and the

sudden spectacle of him was disconcerting.
"Hello, Fores!" said Horrocleave very sardonically, with no other

greeting. "I thought ye were too ill to move." No word of sympathy

in the matter of the accident! Simply the tone of an employer somehow

aggrieved!
"I'm out to-day for the first time. Had to come down here on a

matter—"
Horrocleave spoke lower, and even more sardonically. "I hear ye're off

to America."
Louis looked through the fretted partition at the figure of Krupp

alone in the lounge. And Horrocleave also looked at Krupp. And

Krupp looked back with his enigmatic gaze, perhaps scornful, perhaps

indifferent, perhaps secretly appreciative—but in any case profoundly

foreign and aloof and sinister.
"Well—" Louis began at a disadvantage. "Who says I'm off to America?"
Horrocleave advanced his chin and clenched a fist.
"Don't you go!" said he. "If ye did, ye might be brought back by

the scruff o' the neck. You mark my words and come down to the works

to-morrow morning—to-morrow, ye understand!" He was breathing

quickly. Then a malicious grin seemed to pass over his face as his

glance rested for an instant on Louis' plasters. The next instant he

walked away, and Louis heard him at the cloak-room counter barking the

one word, "Mackintosh."
Louis understood, only too completely. During his absence from the

works Horrocleave had amused himself by critically examining the old

petty-cash book. That was all, and it was enough. Good-bye to romance,

to adventure, to the freedom of the larger world! The one course to

pursue was to return home, to deny (as was easy) that the notion

of going to America had ever occurred to him, or even the notion of

putting up at the hotel, and with such dignity as he could assume to

restore to Horrocleave the total sum abstracted. With care and luck

he might yet save his reputation. It was impossible that Horrocleave

should prosecute. And what was seventy odd pounds, after all? He was

master of thousands.
If he could but have walked straight out of the hotel! But he could

not. His dignity, the most precious of all his possessions, had to be

maintained. Possibly Krupp had overheard the conversation, or divined

its nature. He strolled back into the lounge.
"A benedictine," he ordered casually, and, neatly pulling up his

trousers at the knee, sank into a basket-chair and crossed his legs,

while blowing forth much smoke.
"Yes, sir."
When Krupp brought the tiny glass, Louis paid for it without looking

at him, and gave a good tip. Ah! He would have liked to peer into

Krupp's inmost mind and know exactly how Krupp had been discussing

him with Jim Horrocleave. He would have liked to tell Krupp in cutting

tones that waiters had no right to chatter to one customer about

another. And then he would have liked to destroy Krupp. But he could

not. His godlike dignity would not permit him to show by even the

slightest gesture that he had been inconvenienced. The next moment he

perceived that Providence had been watching over him. If he had gone

to America unknown to Horrocleave, Horrocleave might indeed have

proved seriously awkward.... Extradition—was there such a word, and

such a thing? He finished the benedictine, went to the cloak-room

and obtained his hat, coat, stick, and parcel; and the hovering Krupp

helped him with his overcoat; and as Destiny cast him out of the dear

retreat which a little earlier he had entered with such pleasurable

anticipations, he was followed down the corridor by the aloof,

disinterested gaze of the Swiss whose enigma no Staffordshire man had

ever penetrated.

CHAPTER XVIII
MRS. TAMS'S STRANGE BEHAVIOUR

I
In the house at Bycars, where he arrived tardily after circuitous

wanderings, Louis first of all dropped the parcel from Faulkner's into

the oak chest, raising and lowering the lid without any noise. Once,

in the train in Bleakridge tunnel, he had almost thrown the parcel out

of the carriage on to the line, as though it were in some subtle way

a piece of evidence against him; but, aided by his vanity, he had

resisted the impulse. Why, indeed, should he be afraid of a parcel of

linen? Had he not the right to buy linen when and how he chose? Then

he removed his hat and coat, hung them carefully in their proper

place, smoothed his hair, and walked straight into the parlour. He had

a considerable gift of behaving as though nothing out of the ordinary

had happened when the contrary was the case. Nobody could have guessed

from his features that he was calculating and recalculating

the chances of immediate imprisonment, and that each successive

calculation disagreed with the previous one; at one moment the chances

were less than one in a hundred, less than one in a million;

at another they increased and multiplied themselves into tragic

certainty.
When Rachel heard him in the lobby her sudden tears were tears of joy

and deliverance. She did not try to restrain them. As she stole back

to her chair she ignored all her reasonings against him, and lived

only in the fact that he had returned. And she was triumphant. She

thought: "Now that he is in the house, he is mine. I have him. He

cannot escape me. In a caress I shall cancel all the past since his

accident. So long as I can hold him I don't care." Her soul dissolved

in softness towards him; even the body seemed to melt also, till,

instead of being a strong, sturdy girl, she was a living tentacular

endearment and naught else.
But when, with disconcerting quickness, he came into the room, she

hardened again in spite of herself. She simply could not display her

feelings. Upbringing, habit, environment were too much for her, and

spontaneity was checked. Had she been alone with a dog she would have

spent herself passionately on the dog, imaginatively transforming the

dog into Louis; but the sight of Louis in person congealed her, so

that she became a hard mass with just a tiny core of fire somewhere

within.
"Why cannot I jump up and fall on his neck?" she asked herself

angrily. But she could not.
She controlled her tears, and began to argue mentally whether Louis

had come home because he could not keep away from her, or for base

purposes of his own. She was conscious of a desire to greet him

sarcastically with the remark, "So you've come back, after all!" It

was a wilful, insensate desire; but there it was. She shut her lips on

it, not without difficulty.
"I've kept some supper for you," she said, with averted head. She

wanted to make her voice kind, but it would not obey her. It was

neither kind nor unkind. There were tears in it, however.
They did not look at each other.
"Why did you keep supper for me?" he mumbled.
"I thought you might find you weren't well enough to travel," she

answered thoughtfully, with her face still bent over the work which

she was spoiling with every clumsy, feverish stitch.
This surprising and ingenious untruth came from her without the

slightest effort. It seemed to invent itself.
"Well," said Louis, "I don't happen to want any supper." His accent

was slightly but definitely inimical. He perceived that he had an

advantage, and he decided to press it.
Rachel also perceived this, and she thought resentfully: "How cruel

he is! How mean he is!" She hated and loved him simultaneously. She

foresaw that peace must be preceded by the horrors of war, and she was

discouraged. Though determined that he should not escape from the room

unreconciled, she was ready to inflict dreadful injuries on him, as

he on her. They now regarded each other askance, furtively, as dire

enemies.
Louis, being deficient in common sense, thought of nothing but

immediate victory. He well knew that, in case of trouble with Jim

Horrocleave, he might be forced to humble himself before his wife, and

that present arrogance would only intensify future difficulties. Also,

he had easily divined that the woman opposite to him was a softer

Rachel than the one he had left, and very ready for pacific

compromise. Nevertheless, in his polite, patient way, he would

persist in keeping the attitude of an ill-used saint with a most

clear grievance. And more than this, he wanted to appear absolutely

consistent, even in coming home again. Could he have recalled the

precise terms of his letter, he would have contrived to interpret them

so as to include the possibility of his return that night. He fully

intended to be the perfect male.
Drawing his cigarette-case and match-box from his hip pocket, by means

of the silver cable which attached them to his person, he carefully

lit a cigarette and rose to put the spent match in the fire. While at

the hearth he looked at his plastered face in the glass, critically

and dispassionately, as though he had nothing else in the world to do.

Then his eye caught some bits of paper in the fender—fragments of his

letter which Rachel had cast into the fire and on to the hearth. He

stooped, picked up one white piece, gazed at it, dropped it, picked up

another, gazed at it, dropped it fastidiously.
"Hm!" he said faintly.
Then he stood again at his full height and blew smoke profusely about

the mantelpiece. He was very close to Rachel, and above her. He

could see the top of her bent, mysterious head; he could see all the

changing curves of her breast as she breathed. He knew intimately

her frock, the rings on her hand, the buckle on her shoe. He knew the

whole feel of the room—the buzz of the gas, the peculiarities of the

wall-paper, the thick curtain over the door to his right, the folds of

the table-cloth. And in his infelicity and in his resentment against

Rachel he savoured it all not without pleasure. The mere inviolable

solitude with this young, strange, provocative woman in the night

beyond the town stimulated him into a sort of zest of living.
There was a small sound from the young woman; her breathing was

checked; she had choked down a dry sob. This signal, so faint and

so dramatic in the stillness of the parlour, at once intimidated and

encouraged him.
"What have you done with that money?" he asked, in a cold voice.
"What money?" Rachel replied, low, without raising her head. Her hand

had ceased to move the needle.
"You know what money."
"I took it to Julian, of course."
"Why did you take it to Julian?"
"We agreed I should, last week—you yourself said so—don't you

remember?" Her tones acquired some confidence.
"No, I don't remember. I remember something was said about letting him

have half of it. Did you give him half or all of it?"
"I gave him all of it."
"I like that! I like that!" Louis remarked sarcastically. "I like

your nerve. You do it on the sly. You don't say a word to me; and not

content with that, you give him all of it. Why didn't you tell me? Why

didn't you ask me for the money?"
Rachel offered no answer.
Louis proceeded with more vivacity. "And did he take it?"
"I made him."
"What? All of it? What reason did you give? How did you explain

things?"
"I told him you'd had the rest of the money, of course, so it was all

right. It wouldn't have been fair to him if some one hadn't told him."
Louis now seriously convinced himself that his grievance was

tremendous, absolutely unexampled in the whole history of marriage.
"Well," said he, with high, gloomy dignity, "it may interest you to

know that I didn't have the rest of the money.... If I'd had it,

what do you suppose I've done with it?... Over five hundred pounds,

indeed!"
"Then what—?"
"I don't think I want any of your 'Then what's.' You wouldn't listen

before, so why should you be told now? However, I expect I must teach

you a lesson—though it's too late."
Rachel did not move. She heard him say that he had discovered the

bank-notes at night, under the chair on the landing. "I took charge of

them. I collared them, for the time being," he said. "I happened to

be counting them when you knocked at my bedroom door. I admit I was

rather taken aback. I didn't want you to see the notes. I didn't see

any reason why you should know anything about my aunt's carelessness.

You must remember you were only a paid employee then. I was close to

the fireplace. I just scrunched them up in my hand and dropped them

behind the fire-screen. Of course I meant to pick them up again

instantly you'd gone. Well, you didn't go. You seemed as if you

wouldn't go. I had to run for the doctor. There was no help for it.

Even then I never dreamt you intended to light the fire in that room.

It never occurred to me for a second.... And I should have thought

anybody lighting a fire couldn't have helped seeing a thing like a

ball of bank-notes on the top of the grate. I should have thought so.

But it seems I was wrong. When I got back of course the whole blooming

thing was up the chimney. Well, there you are! What was I to do? I ask

you that."
He paused. Rachel sobbed.
"Of course," he continued, with savage quietude, "you may say I might

have forced you to listen to me this last week. I might. But why

should I? Why should I beg and pray? If you didn't know the whole

story a week ago, is it my fault? I'm not one to ask twice. I can't go

on my knees and beg to be listened to. Some fellows could perhaps, but

not me!"
Rachel was overwhelmed. The discovery that it was she herself,

Pharisaical and unyielding, who had been immediately responsible

for the disappearance of the bank-notes almost dazed her. And

simultaneously the rehabilitation of her idol drowned her in bliss.

She was so glad to be at fault, so ravished at being able to respect

him again, that the very ecstasy of existing seemed likely to put an

end to her existence. Her physical sensations were such as she might

have experienced if her heart had swiftly sunk away out of her bosom

and left an empty space there that gasped. She glanced up at Louis.
"I'm so sorry!" she breathed.
Louis did not move, nor did his features relax in the slightest.
With one hand raised in appeal, surrender, abandonment and the other

on the arm of her chair, and her work slipping to the floor, she half

rose towards him.
"You can't tell how sorry I am!" she murmured. Her eyes were liquid.

"Louis!"
"And well you may be, if you'll excuse me saying so!" answered Louis

frigidly.
He was confirmed in his illusory but tremendous grievance. The

fundamental lack of generosity in him was exposed. Inexperienced

though he was in women, he saw in Rachel then, just as if he had been

twenty years older, the woman who lightly imagines that the past

can be wiped out with a soft tone, an endearment, a tear, a touching

appeal. He would not let her off so easily. She had horribly lacerated

his dignity for a week—he could recall every single hurt—and he

was not going to allow himself to recover in a minute. His dignity

required a gradual convalescence. He was utterly unaffected by her

wistful charm.
Rachel moved her head somewhat towards his, and then hesitated. The

set hardness of his face was incredible to her. Her head began to

swim. She thought, "I shall really die if this continues."
"Louis—don't!" she besought him plaintively.
He walked deliberately away and nervously played with an "ornament" on

the sideboard.
"And let me tell you another thing," said he slowly. "If you think I

came back to-night because I couldn't do without you, you're mistaken.

I'm going out again at once."
She said to herself, "He has killed me!" The room circled round her,

gathering speed, and Louis with it. The emptiness in her bosom was

intolerable.

II
Louis saw her face turning paler and paler, till it was, really,

almost as white as the table-cloth. She fell back into the chair, her

arms limp and lifeless.
"Confound the girl!" he thought. "She's going to faint now! What an

infernal nuisance!"
Compunction, instead of softening him, made him angry with himself. He

felt awkward, at a loss, furious.
"Mrs. Tams!" he called out, and hurried from the room. "Mrs. Tams!" As

he went out he was rather startled to find that the door had not been

quite closed.
In the lobby he called again, "Mrs. Tams!"
The kitchen gas showed a speck of blue. He had not noticed it when he

came into the house: the kitchen door must have been shut, then. He

looked up the stairs. He could discern that the door of Mrs. Tams's

bedroom, at the top, was open, and that there was no light in the

room. Puzzled, he rushed to the kitchen, and snatched at his hat as he

went, sticking it anyhow on his head.
"Eh, mester, what ever's amiss?"
With these alarmed words Mrs. Tams appeared suddenly from behind the

kitchen door; she seemed a little out of breath, as far as Louis could

hear; he could not see her very well. The thought flashed through his

mind. "She's been listening at doors."
"Oh! There you are," he said, with an effort at ordinariness of

demeanour. "Just go in to Mrs. Fores, will you? Something's the matter

with her. It's nothing, but I have to go out."
Mrs. Tams answered, trembling: "Nay, mester, I'm none going to

interfere. I go into no parlour."
"But I tell you she's fainting."
"Ye'd happen better look after her yerself, Mr. Louis," said Mrs. Tams

in a queer voice.
"But don't you understand I've got to go out?"
He was astounded and most seriously disconcerted by Mrs. Tams's very

singular behaviour.
"If ye'll excuse me being so bold, sir," said Mrs. Tams, "ye ought

for be right well ashamed o' yeself. And that I'll say with my dying

breath."
She dropped on to the hard Windsor chair, and, lifting her apron,

began to whimper.
Louis could feel himself blushing.
"It seems to me you'd better look out for a fresh situation," he

remarked curtly, as he turned to leave the kitchen.
"Happen I had, mester," Mrs. Tams agreed sadly; and then with fire:

"But I go into no parlour. You get back to her, mester. Going out

again at this time o' night, and missis as her is! If you stop where a

husband ought for be, her'll soon mend, I warrant."
He went back, cursing all women, because he had no alternative but to

go back. He dared not do otherwise.... It was only a swoon. But was

it only a swoon? Suppose ...! He was afraid of public opinion; he

was afraid of Mrs. Tams's opinion. Mrs. Tams had pierced him. He went

back, dashing his hat on to the oak chest.

III
Rachel was lying on the hearth-rug, one arm stretched nonchalantly

over the fender and the hand close to the fire. Her face was whiter

than any face he had ever seen, living or dead. He shook; the

inanimate figure with the disarranged clothes and hair, prone and

deserted there in the solitude of the warm, familiar room, struck

terror into him. He bent down; he knelt down and drew the arm away

from the fire. He knew not in the least what was the proper thing to

do; and naturally the first impulse of his ignorance was to raise

her body from the ground. But she was so heavy, so appallingly inert,

that, fortunately, he could not do so, and he let her head subside

again.
Then he remembered that the proper thing to do in these cases was to

loosen the clothes round the neck; but he could not loosen her bodice

because it was fastened behind and the hooks were so difficult. He

jumped to the window and opened it. The blind curved inward like a

sail under the cold entering breeze. When he returned to Rachel

he thought he noticed the faintest pinky flush in her cheeks. And

suddenly she gave a deep sigh. He knelt again. There was something

about the line of her waist that, without any warning, seemed to him

ineffably tender, wistful, girlish, seductive. Her whole figure began

to exert the same charm over him. Even her frock, which nevertheless

was not even her second best, took on a quality that in its simplicity

bewitched him. He recalled her wonderful gesture as she lighted his

cigarette on the night when he first saw her in her kitchen; and his

memory of it thrilled him.... Rachel opened her eyes and sighed deeply

once more. He fanned her with a handkerchief drawn from his sleeve.
"Louis!" she murmured in a tired baby's voice, after a few moments.
He thought: "It's a good thing I didn't go out, and I'm glad Mrs.

Tarns isn't here blundering about."
"You're better?" he said mildly.
She raised her arms and clasped him, dragging him to her with a force

that was amazing under the circumstances. They kissed; their faces

were merged for a long time. Then she pushed him a little away, and,

guarding his shoulders with her hands, examined his face, and smiled

pathetically.
"Call me Louise," she whispered.
"Silly little thing! Shall I get you some water?"
"Call me Louise!"
"Louise!"

CHAPTER XIX
RACHEL AND MR. HORROCLEAVE

I
The next morning, Sunday, Rachel had a fancy to superintend in person

the boiling of Louis' breakfast egg. For a week past Louis had not

been having his usual breakfast, but on this morning the ideal

life was recommencing in loveliest perfection for Rachel. The usual

breakfast was to be resumed; and she remembered that in the past the

sacred egg had seldom, if ever, been done to a turn by Mrs. Tams. Mrs.

Tams, indeed, could not divide a minute into halves, and was apt

to regard a preference for a certain consistency in a boiled egg as

merely finicking and negligible. To Mrs. Tams a fresh egg was a fresh

egg, and there was no more to be said.
Rachel entered the kitchen like a radiance. She was dressed with

special care, rather too obviously so, in order that she might be

worthy to walk by Louis' side to church. She was going with him to

church gladly, because he had rented the pew and she desired to please

him by an alert gladness in subscribing to his wishes; it was not

enough for her just to do what he wanted. Her eyes glittered above the

darkened lower lids; her gaze was self-conscious and yet bold; a faint

languor showed beneath her happy energy. But there was no sign that on

the previous evening she had been indisposed.
Mrs. Tams was respectfully maternal, but preoccupied. She fetched the

egg for Rachel, and Rachel, having deposited it in a cooking-spoon,

held it over the small black saucepan of incontestably boiling water

until the hand of the clock precisely covered a minute mark, whereupon

she deftly slipped the egg into the saucepan; the water ceased to boil

for a few seconds and then bubbled up again. And amid the heavenly

frizzling of bacon and the odour of her own special coffee Rachel

stood sternly watching the clock while Mrs. Tams rattled plates and

did the last deeds before serving the meal. Then Mrs. Tarns paused and

said—
"I don't hardly like to tell ye, ma'm—I didn't hardly like to tell ye

last night when ye were worried like—no, and I dunna like now like,

but its like as if what must be—I must give ye notice to leave. I

canna stop here no longer."
Rachel turned to her, protesting—
"Now, Mrs. Tams, what are you talking about? I thought you were

perfectly happy here."
"So I am, mum. Nobody could wish for a better place. I'm sure I've no

fault to find. But it's like as if what must be."
"But what's the matter?"
"Well, ma'am, it's Emmy." (Emmy was Mrs. Tams's daughter and the

mother of her favourite grandchild.) "Emmy and all on' em seem to

think it'll be better all round if I don't take a regular situation,

so as I can be more free for 'em, and they'll all look after me i' my

old age. I s'll get my old house back, and be among 'em all. There's

so many on 'em."
Every sentence contained a lie. And the aged creature went on lying

to the same pattern until she had created quite a web of convincing

detail—more than enough to persuade her mistress that she was in

earnest, foolishly in earnest, that she didn't know on which side

her bread was buttered, and that the poorer classes in general had no

common sense.
"You're all alike," said the wise Rachel.
"I'm very sorry, ma'm."
"And what am I to do? It's very annoying for me, you know. I thought

you were a permanency."
"Yes, ma'am."
"I should like to give your daughters and daughters-in-law a piece of

my mind.... Good heavens! Give me that cooking-spoon, quick!"
She nipped the egg out of the saucepan; it was already several seconds

overdone.
"It isn't as if I could keep you on as a charwoman," said Rachel. "I

must have some one all the time, and I couldn't do with a charwoman as

well."
"No, ma'am! It's like as if what must be."
"Well, I hope you'll think it over. I must say I didn't expect this

from you, Mrs. Tams."
Mrs. Tams put her lips together and bent obstinately over a tray.
Rachel said to herself: "Oh, she really means to leave! I can see

that. She's made up her mind.... I shall never trust any servant

again—never!"
She was perhaps a little hurt (for she considered that she had much

benefited Mrs. Tams), and a little perturbed for the future. But in

her heart she did not care. She would not have cared if the house had

fallen in, or if her native land had been invaded and enslaved by a

foreign army. She was at peace with Louis. He was hers. She felt that

her lien on him was strengthened.

II
The breakfast steaming and odorous on the table, and Rachel all

tingling in front of her tray, awaited the descent of the master of

the house. The Sunday morning post, placed in its proper position by

Mrs. Tams, consisted of a letter and a post-card. Rachel stretched her

arm across the table to examine them. The former had a legal aspect.

It was a foolscap envelope addressed to Mrs. Maldon. Rachel opened it.

A typewritten circular within respectfully pointed out to Mrs. Maldon

that if she had only followed the writers' advice, given gratis a few

weeks earlier, she would have made one hundred and twenty-five pounds

net profit by spending thirty-five pounds in the purchase of an option

on Canadian Pacific Railway shares. The statement was supported by

the official figures of the Stock Exchange, which none could question.

"Can you afford to neglect such advice in future?" the writers

asked Mrs. Maldon, and went on to suggest that she should send them

forty-five pounds to buy an option on "Shells," which were guaranteed

to rise nine points in less than a month.
Mystified, half sceptical, and half credulous, Rachel reflected

casually that the world was full of strange phenomena. She wondered

what "Shells" were, and why the writers should keep on writing to

a woman who had been dead for ages. She carefully burnt both the

circular and the envelope.
And then she looked at the post-card, which was addressed to "Louis

Fores, Esq." As it was a post-card, she was entitled to read it.

She read: "Shall expect you at the works in the morning at ten. Jas.

Horrocleave." She thought it rather harsh and oppressive on the part

of Mr. Horrocleave to expect Louis to attend at the works on Bank

Holiday—and so soon after his illness, too! How did Mr. Horrocleave

know that Louis was sufficiently recovered to be able to go to the

works at all?
Louis came, rubbing his hands, which for an instant he warmed at the

fire. He was elegantly dressed. The mere sight of him somehow thrilled

Rachel. His deportment, his politeness, his charming good-nature were

as striking as ever. The one or two stripes (flesh-coloured now,

not whitish) on his face were not too obvious, and, indeed, rather

increased the interest of his features. The horrible week was

forgotten, erased from history, though Rachel would recollect that

even at the worst crisis of it Louis had scarcely once failed in

politeness of speech. It was she who had been impolite—not once,

but often. Louis had never raged. She was contrite, and her penitence

intensified her desire to please, to solace, to obey. When she

realized that it was she who had burnt that enormous sum in

bank-notes, she went cold in the spine.
Not that she cared twopence for the enormous sum, really, now that

concord was established! No, her little flutters of honest remorse

were constantly disappearing in the immense exultant joy of being

alive and of contemplating her idol. Louis sat down. She smiled at

him. He smiled back. But in his exquisite demeanour there was a faint

reserve of melancholy which persisted. She had not yet that morning

been able to put it to flight; she counted, however, on doing so very

soon, and in the meantime it did not daunt her. After all, was it not

natural?
She began—
"I say, what do you think? Mrs. Tams has given me notice."
She pretended to be aggrieved and to be worried, but essential joy

shone through these absurd masks. Moreover, she found a certain

naïve satisfaction in being a mistress with cares, a mistress to whom

"notice" had to be given, and who would have to make serious inquiry

into the character of future candidates for her employment.
Louis raised his eyebrows.
"Don't you think it's a shame?"
"Oh," said he cautiously, "you'll get somebody else as good,

and better. What's she leaving for?"
Rachel repeated Mrs. Tams's rigmarole.
"Ah!" murmured Louis.
He was rather sorry for Mrs. Tams. His good-nature was active enough

this morning. But he was glad that she had taken the initiative. And

he was content that she should go. After the scene of the previous

night, their relations could not again have been exactly what the

relations between master and servant ought to be. And further, "you

never knew what women wouldn't tell one another," even mistress and

maid, maid and mistress. Yes, he preferred that she should leave. He

admired her and regretted the hardship on the old woman—and that was

an end of it! What could he do to ease her? The only thing to do would

be to tell her privately that so far as he was concerned she might

stay. But he had no intention of doing aught so foolish. It was

strange, but he was entirely unconscious of any obligation to her for

the immense service she had rendered him. His conclusion was that some

people have to be martyrs. And in this he was deeply right.
Rachel, misreading his expression, thought that he did not wish to be

bothered with household details. She recalled some gratuitous advice

half humorously offered to her by a middle-aged lady at her reception,

"Never talk servants to your men." She had thought, at the time, "I

shall talk everything with my husband." But she considered that

she was wiser now.
"By the way," she said in a new tone, "there's a post-card for you.

I've read it. Couldn't help."
Louis read the post-card. He paled, and Rachel noticed his pallor. The

fact was that in his mind he had simply shelved, and shelved again,

the threat of James Horrocleave. He had sincerely desired to tell a

large portion of the truth to Rachel, taking advantage of her soft

mood; but he could not; he could not force his mouth to open on the

subject. In some hours he had quite forgotten the danger—he was

capable of such feats—then it reasserted itself and he gazed on it

fascinated and helpless. When Rachel, to please him and prove her

subjugation, had suggested that they should go to church—"for the

Easter morning service"—he had concurred, knowing, nevertheless,

that he dared not fail to meet Horrocleave at the works. On the whole,

though it gave him a shock, he was relieved that Horrocleave had sent

the post-card and that Rachel had seen it. But he still was quite

unable to decide what to do.
"It's a nice thing, him asking you to go to the works on a Bank

Holiday like that!" Rachel remarked.
Louis answered: "It's not to-morrow he wants me. It's to-day."
"Sunday!" she exclaimed.
"Yes. I met him for a second yesterday afternoon, and he told me then.

This was just a reminder. He must have sent it off last night. A good

thing he did send it, though. I'd quite forgotten."
"But what is it? What does he want you to go on Sunday for?"
Louis shrugged his shoulders, as if to intimate that nothing that

Horrocleave did ought to surprise anybody.
"Then what about church?"
Louis replied on the spur of the moment—
"You go there by yourself. I'll meet you there. I can easily be there

by eleven."
"But I don't know the pew."
"They'll show you your pew all right, never fear."
"I shall wait for you in the churchyard."
"Very well. So long as it isn't raining."
She kissed him fervently when he departed.
Long before it was time to leave for church she had a practical and

beautiful idea—one of those ideas that occur to young women in love.

Instead of waiting for Louis in the churchyard she would call for him

at the works, which was not fifty yards off the direct route to St.

Luke's. By this means she would save herself from the possibility of

inconvenience within the precincts of the church, and she would also

prevent the conscienceless Mr. Horrocleave from keeping Louis in the

office all the morning. She wondered that the idea had not occurred

to Louis, who was very gifted in such matters as the arrangement of

rendezvous.
She started in good time because she wanted to walk without hurry, and

to ponder. The morning, though imperfect and sunless, had in it some

quality of the spring, which the buoyant youth of Rachel instantly

discovered and tasted in triumph. Moreover, the spirit of a festival

was abroad, and visible in the costume and faces of passers-by; and

it was the first festival of the year. Rachel responded to it eagerly,

mingling her happiness with the general exultation. She was intensely,

unreasonably happy. She knew that she was unreasonably happy; and she

did not mind.
When she turned into Friendly Street the big black double gates of

the works were shut, but in one of them a little door stood ajar.

She pushed it, stooped, and entered the twilight of the archway. The

office door was shut. She walked uncertain up the archway into the

yard, and through a dirty window on her left she could dimly discern

a man gesticulating. She decided that he must be Horrocleave. She

hesitated, and then, slightly confused, thought, "Perhaps I'd better

go back to the archway and knock at the office door."

III
In the inner office, among art-lustre ware, ink-stained wood, dusty

papers, and dirt, Jim Horrocleave banged down a petty-cash book on to

Louis' desk. His hat was at the back of his head, and his eyes blazed

at Louis, who stood somewhat limply, with a hesitant, foolish, faint

smile on his face.
"That's enough!" said Horrocleave fiercely. "I haven't had patience to

go all through it. But that's enough. I needn't tell ye I suspected ye

last year, but ye put me off. And I was too busy to take the trouble

to go into it. However, I've had a fair chance while you've been

away." He gave a sneering laugh. "I'll tell ye what put me on to ye

again, if you've a mind to know. The weekly expenses went down as soon

as ye thought I had suspicions. Ye weren't clever enough to keep 'em

up. Well, what have ye got to say for yeself, seeing ye are on yer way

to America?"
"I never meant to go to America," said Louis. "Why should I go to

America?"
"Ask me another. Then ye confess?"
"I don't," said Louis.
"Oh! Ye don't!" Horrocleave sat down and put his hands on his

outstretched knees.
"There may be mistakes in the petty-cash book. I don't say there

aren't. Any one who keeps a petty-cash book stands to lose. If he's

too busy at the moment to enter up a payment, he may forget it—and

there you are! He's out of pocket. Of course," Louis added, with a

certain loftiness, "as you're making a fuss about it I'll pay up for

anything that's wrong ... whatever the sum is. If you make it out to

be a hundred pounds I'll pay up."
Horrocleave growled: "Oh, so ye'll pay up, will ye? And suppose I

won't let ye pay up? What shall ye do then?"
Louis, now quite convinced that Horrocleave was only bullying

retorted, calmly:
"It's I that ought to ask you that question."
The accuser was exasperated.
"A couple o' years in quod will be about your mark, I'm thinking," he

said.
Whereupon Louis was suddenly inspired to answer:
"Yes. And supposing I was to begin to talk about illicit commissions?"
Horrocleave jumped up with such ferocious violence that Louis drew

back, startled. The recent Act of Parliament, making a crime of secret

commissions to customers' employees, had been a blow to the trade

in art-lustre ware, and it was no secret in the inner office that

Horrocleave, resenting its interference with the natural course

of business, had more than once discreetly flouted it, and thus

technically transgressed the criminal law. Horrocleave used to defend

and justify himself by the use of that word "technical." Louis' polite

and unpremeditated threat enraged him to an extreme degree. He was the

savage infuriate. He cared for no consequences, even consequences to

himself. He hated Louis because Louis was spick and span, and quiet,

and because Louis had been palmed off on him by Louis' unscrupulous

respectable relatives as an honest man.
"Now thou'st done for thyself!" he cried, in the dialect. "Thou'st

done for thyself! And I'll have thee by the heels for embezzlement,

and blackmail as well." He waved his arms. "May God strike me if I

give thee any quarter after that! I'll—"
He stopped with open mouth, disturbed by the perception of a highly

strange phenomenon beyond the window. He looked and saw Rachel in the

yard. For a moment he thought that Louis had planned to use his wife

as a shield in the affair if the worst should come to the worst. But

Rachel's appearance simultaneously showed him that he was wrong. She

was the very mirror of happy confidence. And she seemed so young, and

so obviously just married; and so girlish and so womanish at the same

time; and her frock was so fresh, and her hat so pert against the

heavy disorder of the yard, and her eyes were unconsciously so

wistful—that Horrocleave caught his breath. He contrasted Rachel with

Mrs. Horrocleave, her complete antithesis, and at once felt very sorry

for himself and very scornful of Mrs. Horrocleave, and melting with

worshipful sympathy for Rachel.
"Yer wife's in the yard," he whispered in a different tone.
"My wife!" Louis was gravely alarmed; all his manner altered.
"Hast told her anything of this?"
"I should think I hadn't."
"Ye must pay me, and I'll give ye notice to leave," said Horrocleave,

quickly, in a queer, quiet voice. The wrath was driven out of him. The

mere apparition of Rachel had saved her husband.
A silence.
Rachel had disappeared. Then there was a distant tapping. Neither of

the men spoke nor moved. They could hear the outer door open and light

footfalls in the outer office.
"Anybody here?" It was Rachel's voice, timid.
"Come in, come in!" Horrocleave roared.
She entered, blushing, excusing herself, glancing from one to the

other, and by her spotless Easter finery emphasizing the squalor of

the den.
In a few minutes Horrocleave was saying to Rachel, rather

apologetically—
"Louis and I are going to part company, Mrs. Fores. I can't keep him

on. His wages are too high for me. It won't run to it. Th' truth is,

I'm going to chuck this art business. It doesn't pay. Art, as they

call it, 's no good in th' pottery trade."
Rachel said, "So that's what you wanted to see him about on a Sunday

morning, is it, Mr. Horrocleave?"
She was a little hurt at the slight on her husband, but the wife

in her was persuaded that the loss would be Mr. Horrocleave's.

She foresaw that Louis would now want to use his capital in some

commercial undertaking of his own; and she was afraid of the prospect.

Still, it had to be faced, and she would face it. He would probably do

well as his own master. During a whole horrible week her judgment on

him had been unjustly severe, and she did not mean to fall into the

same sin again. She thought with respect of his artistic gifts, which

she was too inartistic to appreciate. Yes, the chances were that he

would succeed admirably.
She walked him off to church, giving Horrocleave a perfunctory

good-bye. And as, shoulder to shoulder, they descended towards St.

Luke's, she looked sideways at Louis and fed her passion stealthily

with the sight. True, even in those moments, she had heart enough left

to think of others besides.
She hoped that John's Ernest would find a suitable mate. She

remembered that she had Julian's curtains to attend to. She continued

to think kindly of Thomas Batchgrew, and she chid herself for having

thought of him in her distant inexperienced youth, of six months

earlier, as that man. And, regretting that Mrs. Tams—at her

age, too!—could be so foolish, she determined to look after Mrs.

Tams also, if need should arise. But these solicitudes were mere downy

trifles floating on the surface of her profound absorption in Louis.

And in the depths of that absorption she felt secure, and her courage

laughed at the menace of life (though the notion of braving a church

full of people did intimidate the bride). Yet she judged Louis

realistically and not sentimentally. She was not conspicuously blind

to any aspect of his character; nor had the tremendous revulsion of

the previous night transformed him into another and a more heavenly

being for her. She admitted frankly to herself that he was not

blameless in the dark affair of the bank-notes. She would not deny

that in some ways he was untrustworthy, and might be capable of acts

of which the consequences were usually terrible. His irresponsibility

was notorious. And, being impulsive herself, she had no mercy for

his impulsiveness. As for his commonsense, was not her burning of the

circular addressed to Mrs. Maldon a sufficient commentary on it?
She was well aware that Louis' sins of omission and commission might

violently shock people of a certain temperament—people of her own

temperament in particular. These people, however, would fail to see

the other side of Louis. If she herself had merely heard of Louis,

instead of knowing him, she would probably have set him down as

undesirable. But she knew him. His good qualities seemed to her to

overwhelm the others. His charm, his elegance, his affectionateness,

his nice speech, his courtesy, his quick wit, his worldliness—she

really considered it extraordinary that a plain, blunt girl, such

as she, should have had the luck to please him. It was indeed almost

miraculous.
If he had faults—and he had—she preferred them (proudly and

passionately) to the faults of scores of other women's husbands. He

was not a brute, nor even a boor nor a savage—thousands of savages

ranged free and terror-striking in the Five Towns. Even when vexed and

furious he could control himself. It was possible to share his daily

life and see him in all his social moods without being humiliated. He

was not a clodhopper; watch him from the bow-window of a morning as he

walked down the street! He did not drink; he was not a beast. He was

not mean. He might scatter money, but he was not mean. In fact, except

that one sinister streak in his nature, she could detect no fault.

There was danger in that streak.... Well, there was danger in every

man. She would accept it; she would watch it. Had she not long since

reconciled herself to the prospect of an everlasting vigil?
She did not care what any one said, and she did not care! He was the

man she wanted; the whole rest of the world was nothing in comparison

to him. He was irresistible. She had wanted him, and she would always

want him, as he was. She had won him and she would keep him, as

he was, whatever the future might hold. The past was the past; the

opening chapter of her marriage was definitely finished and its drama

done. She was ready for the future. One tragedy alone could overthrow

her—Louis' death. She simply could not and would not conceive

existence without him. She would face anything but that.... Besides,

he was not really untrustworthy—only weak! She faltered and

recovered. "He's mine and I wouldn't have him altered for the world. I

don't want him perfect. If anything goes wrong, well, let it go wrong!

I'm his wife. I'm his!" And as, slightly raising her confident chin

in the street, she thus undertook to pay the price of love, there was

something divine about Rachel's face.
