CHAPTER I
THE DRYAD DOOR
It was a horrible day at sea, horrible even on board the new and

splendid Monarchic. All the prettiest people had disappeared from

the huge dining-saloon. They had turned green, and then faded away,

one by one or in hurried groups; and now the very thought of music at

meals made them sick, in ragtime.
Peter Rolls was never sick in any time or in any weather, which was

his one disagreeable, superior-to-others trick. Most of his qualities

were likable, and he was likable, though a queer fellow in some ways,

said his best friends—the ones who called him "Petro." When the ship

played that she was a hobby-horse or a crab (if that is the creature

which shares with elderly Germans a specialty for walking from side to

side), also a kangaroo, and occasionally a boomerang, Peter Rolls did

not mind.
He was sorry for the men and girls he knew, including his sister, who

lay in deck chairs pretending to be rugs, or who went to bed and

wished themselves in their peaceful graves. But for himself, the wild

turmoil of the waves filled him with sympathetic restlessness. It had

never occurred to Peter that he was imaginative, yet he seemed to

know what the white-faced storm was saying, and to want to shout an

answer.
The second morning out (the morning after the Monarchic had to pass

Queenstown without taking on the mails or putting off enraged

passengers) Peter thought he would go to the gymnasium and work up an

appetite for luncheon. He had looked in the first day, and had seen a

thing which could give you all the sensations and benefits of a camel

ride across the desert. He had ridden camels in real deserts and liked

them. Now he did not see why waves should not answer just as well as

dunes, and was looking forward to the experiment; but he must have

been absent-minded, for when he opened what ought to have been the

gymnasium door, it was not the gymnasium door. It was—good

heavens!—what was it?
Peter Rolls, the unimaginative young man, thought that he must be in

his berth and dreaming he was here. For this room that he was looking

into could not possibly be a room on a ship, not even on the

Monarchic, that had all the latest, day-after-to-morrow improvements

and luxuries. The very bread was to-morrow's bread; but these

marvellous creatures could not be supplied by the management as

improvements or luxuries of any kind. Peter seemed to have opened a

door into a crystal-walled world peopled entirely by dryads.
He thought of dryads, because in pictures, beings called by that name

were taller, slimmer, more graceful, more beautiful, and had longer

legs than young females of mortal breed. There were five of them (at

least he believed there were five), and though it was eleven o'clock

in the morning, they were dressed as if for the prince's ball in the

story of "Cinderella." Unless on the stage, Peter had never seen such

dresses or such girls.
He heard himself gasp; and afterward, when he and a wave together had

banged the door shut, he hoped that he had said: "I beg your pardon."

He was so confused, however, that he was not at all sure he had not

blurted out "Good Lord!"
For a moment he stood as still as the sea would let him in front of

the door, burning to open it again and see if the girls were really

there. But, of course, he could not do that. He would have been almost

inclined to believe they were wax figures if they had not moved, but

they had moved.
They had been—sprawling is not a word to use in connection with

dryads—yet certainly reclining, in easy chairs and on sofas, and had

started up as the door opened to stare at him. One had laughed. Peter

had shut the door on her laugh. He had brought away a vague impression

that chairs, sofas, and carpet were pale gray, and that the dryads'

dresses of wonderful tints, sparkling with gold and silver and jewels,

had been brilliant as tropical flowers against the neutral background.

Also, when he came to think of it, he wasn't sure that the walls were

not mostly made of mirrors. That was why he could not be certain

whether he had seen five dryads or five times five.
"The dryad door," he apostrophized it romantically, keeping his

balance by standing with his feet apart, as old men stand before a

fire. It was a very ordinary-looking door, and that made the romance

for Peter in giving it such a name—just a white-painted door, so new

that it smelled slightly of varnish—yet behind it lay dreamland.
Of course Peter Rolls knew that the tall, incredibly lovely beings

were not dryads and not dreams, although they wore low necks, and

pearls and diamonds in their wonderful, waved hair, at eleven o'clock

of a stormy morning on board an Atlantic liner. Still, he was blessed

if he could think what they were, and what they were doing in that

room of mirrors without any furniture which he could recall, except a

very large screen, a few chairs, and a sofa or two.
The next best thing to the forbidden one—opening the door again to

ask the beings point-blank whether they were pipe dreams or just

mermaids—was to go on to the gymnasium and inquire there. Toward this

end young Mr. Rolls (as he was respectfully called in a business house

never mentioned by his sister) immediately took steps. But taking

steps was as far as he got. Suddenly it seemed a deed you could not

do, to demand of an imitation-camel's attendant why five young ladies

wore evening dress in the morning in a room three doors away.
After all, why should a camel attendant dare to know anything about

them? Perhaps they were merely amusing themselves and each other by

trying on all their gladdest clothes. There might be girls who would

think this a good way to kill time in a storm. Yes, conceivably there

might be such girls, just as there might be sea serpents; but, though

Peter Rolls was too shy to have learned much about the female of his

species, the explanation did not appeal to his reason.
His mind would persist in making a mystery of the mirror-walled room

with its five dazzling occupants, and even the bumpings of the

imitation camel could not jerk out of his head speculations which

played around the dryad door. He was as curious as Fatima herself,

and with somewhat the same curiosity; for, except that in one case the

beautiful ladies had their heads, and in the other had lost them,

there was a hint of resemblance between the two mysteries.
Peter Rolls wondered whether he would like to ask his sister Ena if

she knew the visions, or even if, being a woman, she could form any

theory to account for them. It would be interesting to see what she

would say; but then, unless she were too seasick, she would probably

laugh, and perhaps tell Lord Raygan.
As for the visions themselves, only one had spirit enough left in her

to be able to laugh at being thought a dryad or a mystery. She alone

of the five would have known what "dryad" means. And she could always

laugh, no matter how miserable or how sick she was.
That day she was very sick indeed. They were all very sick, but she

could not help seeing, at her worst, that it was funny.
"For heaven's sake, what are you giggling at?" snapped the longest,

slimmest, most abnormal dryad, diaphanously draped in yellow, when she

could gasp out an intelligible sentence after an exhausting bout of

agony.
"Us," said the girl who could always laugh, a vision in silver.
"Us? I don't see anything funny about us!" groaned a tall dream in

crimson and purple.
"Funny! I should think not!" snorted a fantasy in emerald.
"It makes me worse to hear you laugh," squealed a radiance in rose.
"I wish we were all dead, especially Miss Child," snarled the last

of the five, a symphony in black and all conceivable shades of blue.

Because of this combination, the Miss Child in question had named her

the "Bruise."
"Sorry! I'll try not to laugh again till the sea goes down," Miss

Child apologized. "I wasn't laughing at any of you exactly, it was

more the whole situation: us, dressed like stars of the Russian ballet

and sick as dogs, pearls in our hair and basins in our hands, looking

like queens and feeling like dolls with our stuffing gone."
"Don't speak of stuffing. It makes me think of sage and onions,"

quavered the tallest queen.
"Ugh!" they all groaned, except Winifred Child, who was to blame for

starting the subject. "Ugh! Oh! Ugh!"
When they were better they lay back on their sofas, or leaned back in

their chairs, their beautiful—or meant to be beautiful—faces pale,

their eyes shut. And it was at this moment that Peter Rolls burst open

the door.
As he had observed, the waxlike figures moved, sat upright, and

stared. This sudden disturbance of brain balance made them all giddy,

but the surprise of seeing a man, not a steward, at the door, was so

great that for a moment or two it acted as a tonic. Nothing dreadful

happened to any one of the five until after the smooth black head had

been withdrawn and the door closed.
"A man!" breathed Miss Devereux, the abnormally tall girl in yellow

chiffon over gold gauze.
"Yes, dear. I wonder what he wanted?" sighed Miss Carroll, the girl in

rose.
The one in green was Miss Tyndale, the one in black and blue Miss

Vedrine, all very becoming labels; and if they had Christian names of

equal distinction to match, the alien known at home simply as "Win"

had never heard them. They called each other Miss Devereux, Miss

Carroll, Miss Tyndale, and Miss Vedrine, or else "dear."
"I wish we could think he wanted to see us!" remarked Miss Tyndale.
"I hope he didn't notice the basins," added Miss Vedrine
"I think we hid them with our trains," said Miss Carroll.
"Was he nice looking?" Miss Vedrine had courage to ask. She had

wonderful red hair, only a little darker at the roots, and long,

straight black eyelashes. A few of these had come off on her cheeks,

but they were not noticeable at a distance.
"I don't know, I'm sure, dear," replied Miss Devereux, a fawn-eyed

brunette, who was nearest the door. "There wasn't time to see. I just

thought: 'Good heavens! have we got to parade?' Then, 'No, thank

goodness, it's a man!' And he was gone."
"What should we do if a woman did come, and we had to get up?"

wondered Miss Vedrine, whose great specialty was her profile and

length of white throat.
"She wouldn't be a woman; she'd be a monster, to care about clothes in

weather like this," pronounced the golden-haired Miss Carroll. "Parade

indeed! I wouldn't. I'd simply lie down and expire."
"I feel I've never till now sympathized enough with the animals in the

ark," said Miss Child, who had not chosen her own name, or else had

shown little taste in selection, compared with the others. But she

was somehow different, rather subtly different, from them in all ways;

not so elaborately refined, not so abnormally tall, not so startlingly

picturesque. "One always thinks of the ark animals in a procession,

poor dears—showing off their fur or their stripes or their spots or

something—just like us."
"Speak for yourself, if you talk about spots, please," said Miss

Devereux, who never addressed Miss Child as "dear," nor did the

others.
"I was thinking of leopards," explained the fifth dryad. "They're

among the few things you can think of without being sick."
"I can't," said Miss Devereux, and was. They all were, and somehow

Miss Child seemed to be the one to blame.
"We were just getting better!" wailed Miss Vedrine.
"It was only a momentary excitement that cheered us," suggested

Winifred Child.
"What excitement?" they all wanted indignantly to know.
"That man looking in."
"Do you call that an excitement? Where have you lived?"
"Well, a surprise, then. But would we have been better if it had

been madame who looked in?"
The picture called up by this question was so appalling that they

shuddered and forgot their little grudge against Miss Child, who was

not so bad when you were feeling well, except that she had odd ways of

looking at things, and laughed when nobody else could see anything to

laugh at.
"Thank heaven, she's a bad sailor!" Miss Devereux cried.
"Thank heaven, all the other women on board are bad sailors," added

Win.
"If madame was well she'd think we ought to be," said Miss Carroll.

"She'd dock our pay every time we–– Oh, this is bad enough, but if

she was well it would be a million times worse!"
"Could anything be worse?" Miss Tyndale pitifully questioned, for just

then the ship was sliding down the side of a wave as big as a

millionaire's house.
"Yes, it would be worse if we were wearing our waists slender this

year," said Win.
"Down, down, wallow, wallow, jump!" was the program the Monarchic

carried out for the twentieth time in half as many minutes. Slender

waists! Oh, horrible to think of, unless you broke in two and death

ended your troubles!
"Let's try breathing in as she goes up and out as she goes down.

I've heard that works wonderfully," said Win.
They tried, but it worked disappointingly that time. Perhaps it was

the ship's fault. It was impossible to time her antics with the most

careful breathing.
"Oh, why did we leave our peaceful homes?" moaned Miss Vedrine.
"I didn't," whispered Win.
"Didn't what?"
"Leave my peaceful home. If I'd had one I shouldn't be here."
This was the first time she had volunteered or had had dragged out of

her a word concerning her past. But at the moment no one could be

keyed to interest in anything except preparation for the next wave.
In the veranda cafe Peter Rolls was asking his sister Ena if she knew

anything about five incredibly beautiful girls in evening dress shut

up together in a room with walls made of mirrors.
Ena Rolls was not in a mood to answer irrelevant questions, especially

from a brother; but Lord Raygan and his sister were there, and pricked

up their ears at the hint of a mystery. She could not be cross and ask

Peter kindly to go to the devil and not talk rot, as she would have

done if the others had been somewhere else. But then, were it not for

Lord Raygan and his sister and mother, Miss Rolls would be flat in her

berth.
"Five incredibly beautiful girls in evening dress!" repeated Lord

Raygan, who, like Peter, was a good sailor.
Ena Rolls wanted him to be interested in her, and not in five

preposterous persons in evening dress, so she replied promptly to

Peter's question: "I suppose they must be Nadine's living models. We

all had cards about their being on board and the hours of their parade

to show the latest fashions. You saw the card, I suppose, Lady

Eileen?"
"Yes," returned Lord Raygan's flapper sister. "It's on the

writing-desk in that darling sitting-room you've given Mubs and me."
Ena felt rewarded for her sacrifice. She and Peter had engaged the

best suite on board the Monarchic, but when Lord Raygan and his

mother and sister were borne past Queenstown in most unworthy cabins

(two very small ones between the three), Ena had given up her own and

Peter's room to the two ladies. It was a Providential chance to make

their acquaintance and win their gratitude. (She had met Raygan in

Egypt and London, and sailed on the Monarchic in consequence.)
"The stewardess told me before I moved down," she went on, "that Mme.

Nadine had taken the ship's nursery this trip for her show, and fitted

it with wardrobes and mirror doors at immense expense. I'm afraid she

won't get her money back if this storm lasts. Who could gaze at living

models?"
"I could, if they're as beautiful as your brother says," replied Lord

Raygan, a tall, lanky, red-headed Irishman with humorous eyes and a

heavy jaw. He was the first earl Ena had ever met, but she prayed

fervently that he might not be the last.
Peter somehow did not want those pale dryads sacrificed to make a

Raygan holiday. He regretted having remarked on their beauty. "They

looked more like dying than living models when I saw them," he said.
"Let's go and see what they look like now," suggested Raygan. "Eh,

what, Miss Rolls?"
"I don't know if men can go," she hesitated.
"Who's to stop them? Why shouldn't I be wanting to buy one of the

dresses off their backs for my sister?"
"What a melting idea! You do, don't you, dear boy?" the flapper

encouraged him.
"I might. Come along, Miss Rolls. Come along, Eily. What about you,

Rolls? Will you guide us?"
"Let's wait till after lunch," said Ena. She hoped that it might

disagree with everybody, and then they would not want to go.
"Oh, no!" pleaded Lady Eileen O'Neill. "We may be dead after luncheon,

and probably will be. Or Rags'll change his mind about the dress.

Nadine's dresses are too heavenly. I've never seen any except on the

stage, worn by wonderful, thin giantesses. All her gowns are named,

you know, Rags: 'Dawn,' or 'Sunset,' or 'Love in Spring,' or 'Passion

in Twilight,' and poetic things like that."
"Can't be very poetic bein' sick in 'em, by Jove! for those girls in

the nursery," remarked Rags, "especially if they've got a sense of

humour."
(One of them had. The shimmering sheath of silver and chiffon she wore

to-day, as it happened, rejoiced in the name of "First Love." It was

all white. She was being very careful of its virginal purity; but it

occurred to her that unless the sea's passion died, the frock would

soon have to be renamed "Second Love," or even "Slighted Affection,"

if not "Rejected Addresses.")
Urged by Eileen, who would think her a "pig" if she refused, Ena

reluctantly uncurled herself from a safe and graceful position on a

cushioned sofa. The result was alarming. Her swimming head warned her

that if she did not instantly sit down again something too awful to

think of in the presence of an earl would happen.
"You'd better go without me. I'm not very keen," she faintly

explained, appealing to Peter with her eyes.
He contrived to understand without asking stupid questions, as some

brothers would, and hurried the others off to the room of the mirrors.

No longer was it a room of mystery; yet romance, once awakened, cannot

be put to sleep in a minute, and Peter Rolls's heart beat with

excitement or shyness, he was not sure which, as Lady Eileen O'Neill

knocked at the dryad door.
 
 
CHAPTER II
BALM OF GILEAD
It was the worst possible moment for the dryads. But when their

tear-wet eyes beheld a girl and two men, some deep-down primordial

pride of womanhood rushed to their rescue and, flowing through their

veins, performed a miracle beyond the power of any patent remedy. The

five forlorn girls became at need the five stately goddesses Mme.

Nadine paid them to be. (Winifred Child, by the way, was not paid, for

she was not a goddess by profession. But she got her passage free. It

was for that she was goddessing.)
Miss Devereux was the leader, by virtue, not of extra age, no indeed!

but of height, manner, and experience. She apologized, with the most

refined accent, for Mme. Nadine, who was "quite prostrated"; for Mme.

Nadine's manageress, who was even worse; and for themselves. "I'm

afraid we must do the best we can alone," she finished with

unconscious pathos.
"It's a shame to disturb you," said Peter Rolls.
Miss Devereux and her attendant dryads turned their eyes to him. They

had fancied that he was the man who had burst in before and burst out

again; now they were sure. If he had been a woman, they would have

borne him a grudge for coming back and bringing companions worse than

himself; but as he was a man, young, and not bad looking, they forgave

him meekly.
They forgave the other man for the same reason, and forgave the girl

because she was with the men. If only they could behave themselves as

young ladies should through this ordeal! That was the effort on which

they must concentrate their minds and other organs.
"Not at all," returned Miss Devereux, every inch a princess. "We are

here to be disturbed." (Alas, how true!)
She smiled at Lady Eileen, but not patronizingly, because a mysterious

instinct told her that the plain, pleasant young girl in Irish tweed

was a "swell." The men, too, were swells, or important in some way or

other. One exerted one's self to be charming to such people and to

keep the male members of the party from looking at the other girls.

"Would you like to see something else, different from what we are

showing? Evening cloaks? Day dresses? We have a number of smart little

afternoon frocks––"
"I think that white dress is the meltingest thing I ever saw," said

Lady Eileen, who had walked into the room without waiting for Miss

Devereux's answer to Peter Rolls's objection.
She was a kind-hearted girl, but, after all, living models were living

models until they were dead, and she wasn't going to lose the chance

of getting a dreamy frock out of Rags! All the goddesses were on their

mettle and their feet now, though swaying like tall lilies in a high

wind and occasionally bracing themselves against mirrors, while Lady

Eileen was in the biggest chair, with Raygan and Peter Rolls standing

behind her. The men also were offered chairs by Miss Vedrine with a

lovely play of eyelashes, but refused them: the chairs, not the

eyelashes, which no man could have spurned, despite their scattered

effect.
"The white dress, moddam?" (It thrills a flapper to be called

"moddam.") "It is one of the latest designs and considered perfect

for a débutante. No doubt you know it is Mme. Nadine's custom to name

her inspirations. Come here, if you please, Miss Child! This is 'First

Love.'"
"Looks like it," remarked Lord Raygan, as Miss Child obeyed. He might

have meant the wearer or the dress. Peter Rolls flashed a gimlet

glance his way to see which. He felt uncomfortably responsible for the

manners of the visitors and the feelings of the visited. But the face

of Rags was grave, and no offence could be taken. Peter Rolls withdrew

the glance, though not before Winifred Child had it intercepted and

interpreted.
"I believe he's a nice fellow," was the thought that slid through her

mind as, like a chicken on a spit, she turned and turned to let Lady

Eileen behold "First Love" from every point of view.
"Rippin', but a foot too tall for you," said Rags, more because it

amused him to prolong the scene than through a real desire to

criticise. "You don't go in for bein' a sylph."
Another backhanded compliment for the wearer, if she cared to accept

it; but she was beautifully unconscious and, for once, not laughing.

Her eyes looked miles away. Peter Rolls wondered to what land she had

gone.
The girl appeared to be gazing over his head; but, as a matter of

fact, she could see him perfectly. He had black hair and blue eyes,

shrewd perhaps, yet they might be kind and merry; just now they looked

worried. She thought him not handsome, but tanned and thin (she

detested fat men) and somehow nice. Win wondered if she were taller

than he. She hated being taller than men, though she owed her present

engagement to her height and length of limb.
Miss Devereux respectfully argued that appearances were deceitful.

Moddam was quite as sylphlike as the model. Might the dress be sent

to moddam's cabin to try? Then it came out that moddam was Lady

Eileen O'Neill, and the four tallest dryads visibly brightened, not so

much for the owner of the name as for her brother.
Their dull days had been dimly lightened by gossip on the ship,

brought to them by a stewardess from Lord Raygan's native isle, who

knew all about him: that he was an earl, that with his mother and

sister he had booked from Liverpool to Queenstown, but, owing to the

ferocity of the sea, had been unable to land and was being carried to

America. Also that a rich young American and his sister had given up

their suite to the ladies. This American was said to be of no birth,

the son of some big shopkeeper, and far, far outside even the fringe

of the Four Hundred; therefore the tallest dryads did their best

eyelash work for Lord Raygan. They were born British, hailing from

Brixton or other suburban health resorts, and now they knew he was a

"lord" the nickname of "Rags," which had sickened them at first,

seemed interesting and intimate as a domestic anecdote about royalty.
Rags consented to buy the dress for his sister if it fitted and didn't

cost a million pounds. The dryads thought this adorably generous, for

the stewardess, who knew all about Lord Raygan, said that the "family

had become impoverished; they were not what they had once been except

in name, which was of the best and oldest in Ireland." Stewardesses

can tell all the things that Marconi does not mention.
When the sale was settled Miss Devereux turned to Peter Rolls. "And

you, sir?" she asked, slightly coquettish because he was a man, though

not of the Four Hundred. "I suppose there's nothing we can do for

you?"
"I suppose not," Peter was echoing, when something occurred to him.

"Unless," he amended, "my sister would like to buy a dress. She's on

board."
"Would she care to look at Mme. Nadine's designs?" suggested Miss

Devereux. "We have wardrobes full of marvellous inspirations."
"The trouble is, she feels queer if she walks around much," said

Peter.
"Perhaps she would trust you to pick out something she might see in

her own room? Is she tall or short?"
"Not so tall as any of you."
"Things which would fit this young lady would be the best, then.

Miss Child, Miss Vedrine will help you out of 'First Love' behind the

screen and put you into the 'Young Moon.' What"—sotto voce—"are

you laughing at this time?"
"Nothing," said the smallest dryad meekly, though she gurgled under

her breath.
"We'd better go now, and I'll come back," hastily suggested Peter.

"Don't bother to change behind the screen for us, please. I must ask

my sister about the dress."
He got the others out, which was not difficult as far as Eileen was

concerned. She could hardly wait to try "First Love."
Rags was determined to ask Miss Rolls if he shouldn't choose a frock

for her. But she said no, she didn't want one. This would have seemed

to settle the matter, and did for Lord Raygan, who sat down beside

her, abandoning further thought of the dryads. Peter, however,

returned in due course to the room of the mirrors, because Miss Child

could not be allowed to get into the "Young Moon" in such weather for

nothing.
She was in it when he arrived. And pluck, mingled with excitement,

having had a truly bracing effect on the girls, in the absence of the

peer they were nice to the plebeian. The girl in the "Young Moon," to

be sure, had scarcely anything to say, but she had a peculiarly

fascinating way of not saying it.
By the time Mr. Rolls had bought the "Moon" for his sister, he had

become quite friendly with the other dryads, on the strength of a few

simple jokes about green cheese and blue moons and never having

dreamed he could obtain one by crying for it.
"I was wondering," he said at last, when he was about to go, "whether

you'd care for me to bring you some Balm of Gilead?"
"Balm of Gilead?" all five, even the girl in the "Moon," exclaimed.
"Yes. Stuff for seasickness. Not that you are seasick of course. But

the balm's a good preventive. Did you never hear of it?"
They shook their heads.
"It's the great thing our side of the water. I don't need it myself,

but I know it's all right, because it's making my father a fortune."
"Did he invent it?" inquired Miss Carroll.
"No. But he named it and he sells it. It's the men who name things and

sell things, not the ones who invent them, that get the money. My

father is Peter Rolls, and I––"
"I hope you spell Rolls with an 'e,'" broke in Miss Vedrine. "Else it

would remind me of something I want to forget."
"Something you—But maybe I can guess! What the ship does now?"
"Don't speak of it!" they groaned.
"I won't! Or my name, either, if you'd rather not, especially as only

my sister spells it with an 'e.' I mentioned the name on account of

the balm. The barber has no end of bottles. I'll go and buy you one

now. It tastes good. Back in ten minutes." And he was gone.
"His father must be a chemist," sniffed Miss Devereux, as she unhooked

the "Young Moon."
When Peter returned Miss Child was wearing a robe like an illuminated

cobweb on a background of violets. This was the "Yielding Heart."

Peter had brought a bottle and a clean napkin and five teaspoons. "I

got these things off a dining-room steward," he explained.
"Sounds like a conjurer," murmured the girl who laughed.
"How rude of you!" Miss Devereux scolded in a whisper. "Don't mind

her, Mr. Rolls. She isn't a bit like the rest of us."
Peter had noticed that.
"She's always laughing at everything, and everybody, too," went on

Miss Devereux.
"She's welcome to laugh at me," said Peter. "I enjoy it."
"Ladies don't. She'd never do for a permanence with Mme. Nadine.

Clients wouldn't stand being grinned at by models."
"I don't laugh at people. I laugh at the world," the model defended

herself.
"Why?" inquired Peter, with a straight look at the queer, arresting

face.
"To keep it from laughing at me first. And to make it laugh with

me—if I can."
"Do you think you can?"
"I shall try hard—against the biggest odds. And whatever it does to

me, I shan't cry."
"I shouldn't wonder if that wasn't the whole secret of life!" said

Peter Rolls, continuing to look at the face.
Suddenly it flashed a smile at him. "Shouldn't you? Give me the Balm

of Gilead, and the rest would be easy!"
Peter was not stupid as a rule, yet he could not be quite sure what

she meant. If he guessed right, the rest wasn't as easy as she

thought. Yet the words made him wish that he could give the girl who

laughed—the girl who was not to be a "permanence" with Nadine—more

than a teaspoonful of balm.
 
 
CHAPTER III
AN ILL WIND
While the storm held, Peter Rolls went several times each dreadful day

to the room of the mirrors and dosed his dryads with Balm of Gilead.

The medicine—or something else—sustained them marvellously. And it

occurred to Peter that they would make a magnificent advertisement, if

there were any way of using them—the kind of advertisement his father

loved.
It was well that Peter senior was not on board, or he would certainly

propose a new feature for the balm department: scene, richly furnished

salon on a yacht; five fair effects in ball dresses sipping Balm of

Gilead; the whole arrangement on a rocking platform, with mechanism

hidden by realistically painted waves. But the dryads were previously

engaged by the prostrate Nadine—all except one.
When they were sufficiently restored to take an interest, Peter

smuggled grapefruit, chocolates, and novels into the nursery. The

novels his sister had brought with her to kill time during the voyage;

but as it happened, she was killing it with Lord Raygan instead and

never missed the books.
Nadine had been obliged to take first-class tickets for her models;

otherwise the rules of the ship would not have allowed them past the

barrier, even in the pursuit of business. But they sardined in one

cabin, near the bow, on the deepest down deck allotted to

first-classhood, and their private lives were scarcely more enjoyable

than the professional. They were, to be sure, theoretically able to

take exercise at certain hours, weather permitting; but weather did

not permit, and four of the dryads, when free, sought distraction in

lying down rather than walking. It was only the fifth who would not

take the weather's "no" for an answer.
She had a mackintosh, and with her head looking very small and neat,

wound in a brown veil the colour of her hair, she joined the brigade

of the strong men and women who defied the winds by night. From eight

to ten she staggered and slid up and down the wet length of the

least-frequented deck, or flopped and gasped joyously for a few

minutes in an unclaimed chair.
Being "not a bit like the rest" of her sister dryads, she refrained

from mentioning this habit to Mr. Rolls, whose prowling place was on

higher decks. Not that she was still what he would have called

"standoffish" with him. That would have been silly and Victorian after

the grapefruit and chocolates and novels, to say nothing of balm by

the bottleful. The last dress she had worn on the first day of their

acquaintance, the "Yielding Heart," had to a certain extent prophesied

her attitude with the one man who knocked at the dryad door. Miss

Child not only thought Mr. Rolls "might be rather nice," but was

almost sure he was. She was nice to him, too, in dryad land, when he

paid his visits to the sisterhood, but she did not "belong on his

deck."
By and by, however, he discovered her in the mackintosh and veil. It

was one night when a young playwright who had seized on him as prey

wished to find a quiet place to be eloquent about the plot.
"There's a deck two below," said the aspirant for fame, "where nobody

prowls except a young female panther tied up in a veil."
Five minutes later Peter Rolls took off his cap to the female panther.

The playwright noticed this, but was too much interested in himself

and the hope of securing a capitalist to care. In sketching out his

comedy he was blind to any other possibilities of drama, and so did

not see Peter's eagerness to get rid of him. He was even pleased when,

after a few compliments, Rolls junior said: "Look here, you'd better

leave me to think over what you've told me. I fix things in my memory

that way. And maybe when I've got it straight in my head

I'll—er—mention it to a man I know."
As the playwright was shivering, he obeyed with alacrity; and in the

warmth of the smoking-room revelled in the picture of his tame

capitalist pacing a cold deck, lost to the sea's welter in thoughts of

that marvellous last act.
But it was a first act which was engaging Peter Rolls's attention, and

he, though the only male character in it (by choice), had to learn his

part as he went on.
The play began by his joining the leading lady. (This has been done

before, but seldom with such a lurch and on such sloping boards.)
It would have been a mockery to say "good evening" on a night so vile,

and Mr. Rolls began by asking Miss Child if he might walk with her.
"Or tango," said she. "This deck is teaching me some wonderful new

steps."
"I wish you'd teach them to me," said Peter.
"I can't, but the ship can."
"Did you ever dance the tango?" he wanted to know.
"Yes. In another state of existence."
This silenced him for an instant. Then he skipped at least two

speeches ahead, whither his thoughts had flown. "Say, Miss Child, I

wish you'd tell me something about yourself."
"There isn't anything interesting to tell, thank you, Mr. Rolls."
"If that's your only reason, I think you might let me judge. Honestly,

I don't want to intrude or be curious. But you're so different from

the others."
"I know I'm not pretty. That's why I have to be so painfully sweet. I

got the engagement only by a few extra inches. Luckily it isn't the

face matters so much," she chattered on. "I thought it was. But it's

legs; their being long; Mme. Nadine engages on that and your figure

being right for the dresses of the year. So many pretty girls come in

short or odd lengths, you find, when they have to be measured by the

yard, at bargain price."
Peter laughed.
"You're not meant to laugh there," she said. "It's a solemn fact."
"But you always laugh."
"That's because I'm what you'd call 'up against' life. It gives me

such a funny point of view."
"That's part of what I want to talk about. Please don't keep trying to

turn the subject. Unless you think I have no business seizing the

first chance when I find you alone, to––"
"It isn't that," said Win. "I think you're very kind to take the

slightest interest. But really there is nothing to tell. Just the

usual sort of thing."
"It doesn't seem exactly usual to me for a girl about nineteen years

old––"
"Twenty!"
"—to be leaving home alone and starting for a new country."
"Not alone. Mme. Nadine might be furious if she were spoken of as my

chaperon; but she is, all the same. Not that an emigrant needs a

chaperon."
"You an emigrant!"
"Well, what else am I?"
"I've been thinking of you as a dryad."
"A poor, drenched dryad, thousands of miles from her native woods. Do

you know, my veil is soaked?"
"I'll get you a sou'wester hat to-morrow."
"Does the barber keep them as well as Balm of Gilead?"
"No, but my sister does. She keeps one. And she doesn't want it. I

shall annex it."
"Oh! I couldn't take it!"
"If you don't, I'll throw it overboard."
"Were the chocolates hers?"
"Yes."
"And the books?"
"Some were mine. But not the ones Miss Devereux says are pretty. Look

here, Miss Child, another thing she says is that you are not with

Nadine as a permanence. What does that mean, if you don't much mind my

asking?"
"Not what you think. I'm not going to be discharged. I was engaged

only for the voyage, to take the place of a prettier girl with still

longer legs who fell through at the last moment—literally. She

stepped into one of those gas-hole places in the street. And I stepped

into her shoes—lucky shoes!—sort of seven-league ones, bringing me

across the sea, all the way to New York free, for nothing. No! I hope

not for nothing. I hope it is to make my fortune."
"I hope so, too," said Peter gravely. "Got any friends there besides

me?"
"Thanks for putting it so, Mr. Balm of Gilead. Why, I've heard that

everybody in America is ready to be a friend to lonely strangers!"
"I guess your informant was almost too much of an optimist. Couldn't

you be serious for just a minute? You know, I feel quite well

acquainted with you—and the others, of course. But they are

different. And they are 'permanences' with Nadine. That's the kind

of thing they're fit for. I don't worry about them, and I shan't worry

about you, either, if you tell me you have friends or know what you

are going to do when you land."
"I can't tell you that," Win answered in a changed tone, as if

suddenly she were weary of trying to "frivol." "But I have hopes; and

I have two letters of introduction and a respectable, recommended

boarding-house and a little money left, so I really believe I shall be

all right, thank you. My people thought my wanting to come showed 'my

wild spirit,' so I'm anxious to prove as soon as I can—not to them

any more, but to myself—that I can live my own life in a new world

without coming to grief."
"Why not prove to them any more?"
"Oh—because no one is going to care much. As I said, my native woods

are far behind, and most of the trees are cut down. Not a dryad of the

true dryad family left, and this one is practically forgotten already.

Her niche was all grown over with new bark long ago, so it was more

than time she ceased to haunt the place."
"I'm afraid you've had a great sorrow," said Peter.
"It was hardly big enough for that word—this thing that's sent me

seeking my fortune—though it began with a sorrow long ago."
"Some one you loved died?" Peter had a simple, direct way of asking

questions that led you on.
"My mother. When I was fourteen—not old enough to be of much use to

my father and the baby brother. So my father had to get some one to be

a kind of housekeeper and superior nurse. He's a clergyman. I don't

look like a clergyman's daughter, perhaps—and he thought I didn't

behave like one, especially after the housekeeper came. She's the kind

who calls herself 'a lady housekeeper.' I don't know if you have them

in America. She and I had rows—and that upset father. He didn't want

to get rid of her because she managed things splendidly—him and the

baby and the vicarage—and influential old ladies said she 'filled a

difficult position satisfactorily.' So it was simpler to get rid of

me. I went to boarding-school."
"Did you like that?"
"I loved it. After the first year I didn't go home even for the

holidays. Often I visited—girls were nice to me. But I didn't make

the most of my time—I'm furious with myself for that now. I learned

nothing—nothing, really, except the things I wanted to learn. And

those are always the ones that are least useful."
"I found that, too," said Peter, "at Yale."
"It didn't matter for you. You have the Balm of Gilead."
"That's my father's."
"What's his is yours, I suppose."
"He says so. But—we all have our own trouble. Mine's not living up to

my principles, or even knowing exactly what they are—being all in a

turmoil. But it's yours I want to talk about."
"I've forbidden myself the word 'trouble.' It builds a wall. And I've

just broken through my wall. I could have done it sooner and better if

I'd learned more difficult things, that's all. When I wanted to do

something for myself—why, I couldn't do a thing that was any good

in a busy world. I'd had no training except for my voice."
"There! I thought you sounded as if you had a voice!"
"I thought so, too. But that was another of my mistakes."
"I bet it wasn't."
"You'd lose your money, Mr. Rolls. I spent most of mine before I found

out. You see, my mother left a little. It wasn't to come to me till I

was twenty-one, but all sorts of things happened. My father kept me at

school till a year and a half ago because he didn't know what to do

with me. Then my little brother died. I ought to have cared more, but

I hardly knew him. His coming killed my mother; and he loved that

woman. I don't see how he could!
"When he was gone, people might have gossiped about her and father

perhaps. I believe she suggested it to him and said she must go away,

to make him think of marrying her; but all he did was to send for me.

I stood it for six months. It was horrid for all three. I dare say I

was to blame. I had a scene with father, and told him I'd made up my

mind to go to London for singing lessons so I could support myself: I

couldn't live at home. That forced the situation! Before any

one—except the 'lady housekeeper'—knew quite what was happening,

father had asked her to be his wife—or she'd asked him. I went before

the wedding. I'd worshipped my mother! And—but that's all the story."
"I call it only the preface. What about London?"
"Oh, father gave me my money ahead of time, for the lessons. He didn't

approve, on principle, but he would have had no peace with me at home,

and he likes peace better than anything. I had to promise I wouldn't

go into musical comedy. That makes me laugh now! But I thought then

I'd only to ask and to have. I took lessons of a man who'd been a

celebrated tenor. He must have known that my voice was nothing,

really, but he buoyed me up. I suppose they're all like that. It's

business.
"When the money was two thirds spent I dared not go on, and I asked

him to find me something to do. He'd often said he would when the

right time came. Apparently it hadn't come. He made the excuse that I

ought to have stayed with him longer. It would hurt his reputation to

launch a pupil too soon. So I had to try to launch myself. And it

didn't work. One manager of opera companies on whom I forced myself

tested my voice and said it wasn't strong enough—only a twilight

voice for a drawing-room, he called it. I was broken up—just at

first."
"Poor child!" Peter muttered, but the girl's quick ears caught the

words over the roar of that "ill wind" which had brought them

together.
"Child is my surname, and it's not polite to call me by it." She

brought him to his bearings by suddenly "frivolling" again. "They call

militant suffragettes and housemaids sent to prison for stealing their

kind mistresses' jewels by their surnames. I'm not a militant; and

I've not been a housemaid yet, though I may be, if New York isn't

kinder to me than London."
"I hope it will be—kind in just the right way!"
"My friend who gave me the two letters of introduction says it will:

that Americans love English girls, if they have the courage to come

over. She says there are heaps more chances as well as heaps more room

for us in that country than there are at home."
"That's true, but––"
"Please don't discourage me!"
"Not on your life! Only––"
"'Only' is as bad a word as 'but.' I've got a letter of introduction

to the editor of a New York paper, To-day and To-morrow, and one to

the organist of a Higher Thought church. Maud Ellis says they're both

splendid men and interested in women's progress. Something good ought

to come from one or the other. Getting this chance of my passage free

seems a happy omen, as if I were meant to take this great adventure.

I'm not one bit afraid. I feel boiling with courage—except when the

ship pitches and rolls at the same time."
"That's right. You're bound to make good, of course. I wouldn't

discourage you for the world. All I meant to say was that I'd like you

to think of me as a friend. I don't want to lose sight of you when we

land. I might be able to help in some way or other or—my family

might. Before we get off the ship I'll introduce you and my sister to

each other."
"Oh, thank you! You're very kind," the banished dryad said for the

third or fourth time. "But I should be sorry to trouble Miss Rolls.

She wouldn't––"
"Yes, she would," insisted Peter. "She'll be awfully interested when I

tell her about you, Miss Child, and very pleased to know you."
Win was silenced, though not convinced. It is not safe for a brother

to judge his sister by himself.
 
 
CHAPTER IV
THE KINDNESS OF MISS ROLLS
Peter found it not so easy as he had expected to snatch an

opportunity of interesting Ena in Miss Child. His sister was even more

than ordinarily interested in her own affairs, which had reached a

critical stage, and if Peter, having run her to earth in her cabin,

attempted to talk of any one save Ena Rolls or Lord Raygan her eyes

became like shut windows. He could almost see her soul turning its

back and walking away behind the panes of opaque gray glass.
There had been another evening prowl with the young female panther

before the evasive chance was grasped, and the storm-tossed, overdue

Monarchic hoped to dock within eighteen hours.
Things were growing desperate for Peter. He was not, of course, in

love with the "queer, arresting face," but he could not bear to think

of its arriving alone and unprotected in New York. Something must be

done, and he resorted to bribery.
"Look here, Sis," he began, "I've just thought there may be reasons

why Raygan can't make up his mind to visit a bit on our side, now he

and his family are here."
"He hasn't said he won't do it," Ena cut in.
"No, but he hasn't said he will, has he?"
"Not yet. I daren't seem too eager."
"To save my life, I don't see why you should be eager. But as you

are, I've been giving my mind to the subject." (This was subtle of

Peter.) "I've come to the conclusion that the man would like to stay.

I'm sure his sister would. Perhaps you can answer for the mother. The

trouble may be money."
"Perhaps. I've thought of that. But what can we do? We can't go to him

out of a clear sky and offer to lend."
"I might propose to put him on to a good thing."
"Oh, Peter, would you help me like that, in a man's way?"
"I would, if you'd do me a favour, in a woman's way."
"What is it? But whatever it is, I'm sure to!"
They were in Miss Rolls's cabin, the one she had generously taken over

from Lady Raygan and Eileen. Ena was sitting on the seat under the

window; Peter was looking uncomfortable on a camp-chair. It was a

small cabin, boiling over with dresses, though the "Young Moon" had

not yet been added to their number. Peter had never found his sister

in a propitious mood for the gift, and had been keeping the "Moon,"

figuratively, up his sleeve till the right moment came. Now, perhaps

it had come.
Ena had been lying down after luncheon. She had given herself this

little rest because she knew that Raygan was going to play poker in

the smoking-room. She had learned bridge—though cards bored her—just

as she had learned tennis and golf and all sorts of eccentric dances,

in order to be popular, to be in the swim, to do just what the

fashionable people were doing—the people at the top, where she wanted

to arrive.
But she could not play poker! And if she could, it would have been

impossible to go with Lord Raygan into the smoking-room. Luckily no

other girl would be there, so Ena resigned herself to the loss of

valuable time on her last day.
"Why, yes," Peter answered. "I believe you are sure to! It won't be

a hard favour to do, Sis. It's only to let me introduce a girl, a very

nice girl, and then to be kind and help her if she needs it."
Ena laughed. "Is that all? I guess—I mean, I fancy—I can promise

that. Girls don't need much help nowadays Who is she? Have I seen

her?"
"No. You haven't seen her."
"Is she pretty?" Peter had expected that question. Ena, and all the

other girls he knew, invariably asked it. But he did not quite know

what to answer.
"She's awfully attractive," he said. "The sort you'd turn and look

after in a crowd. She hasn't got what you call features, but—you

can't take your eyes off her somehow. She looks—she looks—well, a

tiny bit like a—a—perfectly gloriously fascinating—golliwog."
"A golliwog!"
"Great big, wide-apart eyes, I mean; dark, floating ones, with immense

eyelashes that curl up and stick out when you see her profile. She's

got a short, round face—no, kind of heart-shaped, I guess, and a

little, delicate, turned-up nose, like the Duchess of Marlborough's;

and a lovely mouth—yes, her mouth is lovely, no mistake! She's

nearly always laughing, even when she isn't happy. She's got a long

neck, like a flower stem, and long legs––"
"Good gracious, what a description! For heaven's sake, who is the

girl?"
"Oh, I know it must sound queer; but she's the most fascinating thing

you ever saw, and any man would say so. She's a Miss Child––"
"There's no Miss Child on the passenger list."
"Maybe not; because she's one of Nadine's models, and I bought you a

gorgeous dress off her. I've been—saving it for a surprise. It's

called the 'New'—no, the 'Young Moon.'"
Ena forgot for a moment that she badly needed help from her brother

and began sharply to catechize him. "When did you buy me a dress?

The day Lord Raygan offered to go back to that room and choose me one

and I said no, I didn't want a dress?"
"Yes. That was the day. I couldn't let her try it on in vain."
"Oh, you bought it to please her—the girl like a golliwog?"
"She isn't like a golliwog, really. That's not fair. And I bought the

dress to please you, of course. It's mighty pretty. I've got it in my

room."
"I wonder what your steward thinks? Well, I'll thank you when I see

it. But what an idea, to introduce one of those girls to me! Lord

Raygan said they were all bleached and painted, except the one who

wasn't pretty."
"That's my one. But I think she is pretty, and better than pretty. Her

eyes—and her smile––"
"Never mind her eyes and her smile. I can't be introduced to a

model, Petro. I won't know a dressmaker."
"Mother was one. And father's mother was a washer––"
"Be still, for the love of heaven! If any one should hear!"
"I'm not ashamed of––"
"Well, I am! Oh, Petro, don't be horrid, just when I really need you

to be nice. And you can be nice—very nice. Don't let's even think

about the family past. It's awful! It's a blot! But it can't be

helped. We must try to live it down. And we can, with our money. We

can and we must. A great chance has come to us. All the more because

of—of what you reminded me—we must be careful of the sort of people

we mix ourselves up with––"
"This girl is a lady."
Then Ena lost her temper. "They all are," she snapped. "I suppose

she's a clergyman's daughter and her parents are dead."
"Her mother is," Peter admitted.
"She would be! What does the girl want help for? Doesn't Nadine pay

her wages?"
"She only engaged with Nadine to work out her passage."
"Oh! They say girls from all over the world are bearing down on poor

little old New York since Owen Johnson wrote 'The Salamander.'"
"Jove, Ena, I never knew before you had anything of the cat in you!"
This, and a flash in the eyes which were bluer than hers, brought Miss

Rolls to her bearings. She remembered the reason for going softly with

Peter. Luckily she had done no great mischief yet.
"Can't you take a joke, Petro?" she teased him, laughing "I'm not a

cat, or a pig, either. But you do scare me a little. You don't like

this girl, do you?"
"Of course I like her."
"You know what I mean by 'like.' And I hope I know what you mean.

You always yearn over every creature who hasn't as much money as we

have and needs ours. Sure it's no more than that this time? It would

be—just the limit, the outside edge and down the other side, if you

fell in love with a dressmaker's model. It would be like—like

reverting to type. We must climb, not—root."
Peter laughed—nervously, his sister feared. "What a girl you are! You

needn't fash yourself about my feelings for Miss Child. All I want is

to help her to get on."
"Oh! To help her get on? Well, then, you may introduce her to me, if

it can be done without taking up too much time. You know, Petro, it's

my last day on board, and I have my feelings as much as you. How can

we manage it? Can you bring her here?"
"I can't 'bring' her anywhere," Peter retorted rather gruffly. "She

isn't a servant looking for a place. I've told you she's a lady."
"Oh, all right. What do you suggest?"
"She hasn't much time to herself. Since the weather improved, business

is brisker. But after her dinner she gets in a walk down on B deck,

where nobody else goes. I could take you there about half-past eight."
"Very well. That's the program." Ena spoke with regained cheerfulness,

because no one need witness an introduction effected on B deck, and

because a sentence of Peter's had been like a bull's-eye lantern

directing a ray along the right track. "I'll be ever so nice to Miss

Child to-night—and afterward, too, in New York, if you can bring

anything off with Lord Raygan about the visit. Are you playing poker

with him this afternoon?"
"Yes. Some chaps wanted––"
"I know. He told me. But he didn't mention you. Afterward, will you

work right up to the 'good thing' you can put him on to? He'll be in

just the mood—if he loses. And he says he always does lose."
"Yes. I'll let him see that he might do well for himself by staying.

Gee! Think of a fellow needing a bribe to spend a couple of weeks in

God's country!"
"He doesn't know yet that it is God's country. We must show him. Oh,

Peter, won't the Van Raaltens and the Arlingtons fall over themselves

with rage if the Earl of Raygan and his mother and sister stop with us

for a fortnight!"
"Stop with us for a fortnight!" mimicked Peter, scornful yet

affectionate now. "You get more British every day in your accent and

conversation, my kid."
"Well, I try hard enough! I do like their way of speaking. They make

our voices sound grating and our expressions crude."
"Our ways for mine!"
"You can have them. Now run away, Petro. I'll see the 'Young Moon'

later. I need a nap. Lay awake last night worrying!"
But when he had gone she lay awake planning. This golliwog was

undoubtedly dangerous. The absorbed look in Peter's eyes when he

described her singular attractions contradicted the statement that his

feelings were Platonic.
He "only wanted to help!" Pooh! Still Ena was glad he had said that,

because it had given her a brilliant idea. It was also rather a cruel

idea, but all is fair in love and war: and this might be both.
Of course, if the girl were coming to New York to be a Salamander,

the weapon would be useless. Ena must find another. She could not be

sure until she had met Miss Child; but she told herself that no

glorified golliwog, however sly, could fool her for five minutes!

She would soon know whether Peter were right or wrong about this

daughter of a clergyman whose mother was dead.
Poor Petro, he was such a fool about people—such a dear, nice, but

sometimes inconvenient fool! Just mother's disposition over again,

with a touch of father's cleverness splashed in here and there where

you'd least expect it—but never in the place where it would be most

useful.
As Ena reflected thus, she was vaguely pleased with herself after the

fashion of an earnest student who suddenly finds himself actually

thinking in French. Before she Went to Mme. Yarde's Finishing School

for Young Ladies, she had been so accustomed to saying pa and ma that

it had been very difficult to overcome the habit. Even now, once in a

while, she—but, thank heaven, not once since meeting Lord Raygan;

she was sure of that. He had said, "You talk quite like our girls."

And all the rest of the day she had been happy; for sometimes, in a

good-natured sort of way, he made fun of what he absurdly called "the

American accent."
Ena shut her eyes and composed herself to lie down without ruffling

her hair. But she could not sleep. She made pictures of Lord Raygan

and his mother and Lady Eileen visiting at their house on Long Island.
Would they think it more "swell" of the Rollses to be living in the

country than in New York? She hoped so, and almost believed they

would, for she understood from novels and what she had learned in

London, that the "smart people" only "ran into town for the theatre

and that sort of thing" in winter. Now it was October—almost winter.

And in the automobile it was only an hour and twenty-five minutes from

Sea Gull Manor (Ena had named the new place herself) to New York.
Besides, in the country the visitors wouldn't so easily find out that

the family hadn't got "into" things—the things that mattered. Of

course they could see what the family was. They could see that

anywhere, alas! But poor father and mother were better against a

country background. And foreigners might attribute some quaint tricks

of manner and speech to their being Americans, just as she and Peter

hadn't known how awful the cockney accent was until they had been told

by English people.
Oh, it was lovely over there! Nobody snubbed her. She would give

anything to live on that side all her life, married to a man of title,

and go home occasionally, to pay back the proud cats who had

scratched. Meanwhile, it would be a step on the golden ladder to

flaunt Lord Raygan and his mother and Eileen as guests. Then, if Rags

could swallow the family and propose (as sometimes she thought he

contemplated doing), how wonderful it would be! Her ideal

accomplished!
No golliwog on earth should be allowed to defeat this end. For the

addition of a model, dressmaking golliwog to the family would be the

final obstacle. Lord Raygan was now undecided. He was perhaps waiting

to see how the rest of the Rollses shaped up. If he could stand them

as relations, all would be well. All must be well!
That night Win wore for her walk a long blue coat in place of the

mackintosh. It was shabby, but becoming; and her dark hair was tucked

into a close-fitting cap of the same blue as the cloak. She knew what

was due to happen at half-past eight, and though grateful to Mr. Balm

of Gilead, dreaded the result of his kindness.
Miss Rolls would be the first American girl she had ever met; but she

knew how an English girl would feel about being introduced to a vague

waif picked up by a brother in a dressmaker's showroom on shipboard.

It would have been ungracious to refuse the offered introduction so

well meant, but the fifth dryad was not looking forward to it with

pleasurable sensations.
When she saw the brother and sister coming toward her, however, the

smile on Miss Rolls's face was encouraging. It was dimly like Peter's

smile, and there was a certain family resemblance about the faces:

both dark, with eager eyes that seemed light in contrast with

dead-black hair, but the eagerness of Miss Rolls's look was different

from the eagerness of her brother's. His was slightly wistful in its

search for something he did not yet know. Hers was dissatisfied,

searching for something she wanted and had not got.
He was a lean young man, not very tall, but with rather the air of an

ex-college athlete. She was a plump, short girl, somewhat square in

build, but distinctly handsome, showing beautiful teeth in her cordial

smile. If the smile had been less cordial Miss Child might have

conceived the catty idea that the magnificent ruby-velvet hooded

evening cloak had been put on to impress the humble new acquaintance.

However, it would have been mean to suspect a sister of Mr. Balm of

Gilead of such a snobbish trick. And there was the smile.
"Miss Child, I'm very pleased to meet you," said the handsome girl

warmly, just as her brother had hopefully prophesied. "Peter's told me

quite a lot about you. I think you're awfully brave."
"Perhaps one doesn't deserve much credit for courage in doing a thing

one wants to do," answered Winifred, her slim, ringless hand

responding to the kind pressure of the plump one wearing too many

rings. (They were all rubies to-night. Miss Rolls had read about a

wonderful Russian woman before whom men went down like ninepins and

who always matched her dresses with her jewels.)
Yes, Ena thought, Peter was right; the creature was a lady. She had a

soft, throaty voice, like a blackbird when it talks to itself, and oh,

a creamy accent! Miss Rolls would have given anything to extract it,

like pith, from the long white stem in which it seemed to live. She

would have been willing to pay well for it, and for Miss Child's

length of limb, so necessary to show off the latest fashions. She saw

and appreciated the odd, golliwog charm of wide-apart eyes under high

arch of brow. And the full, laughing mouth, with the short upper lip,

was beautiful, like the mouths of marvellous girls on magazine covers.

The creature looked brave and rather sweet, and Miss Rolls was quite

sorry for her; but the thing had to be done.
"Petro, you go away and let us have a talk," said Petro's kind sister

gayly. "Two is company; three's none."
And Petro went, thinking Ena the grandest sort of a pal. He had done

his best for her already. Raygan and the two ladies had graciously

agreed to stay for a fortnight at least in the country upon which

Providence had thrust them. Peter had Marconied home, and home would

certainly Marconi back an invitation to Sea Gull Manor. As he had said

to Ena, he had pressed the button; she must do the rest. But he felt

now as if he would enjoy doing a great deal more for her than he had

yet done.
"And just what do you want to do in New York, Miss Child?" inquired

Miss Rolls, as they began slowly to pace the otherwise deserted deck.
"I have wild hopes of getting newspaper work of some sort through one

letter of introduction I have," answered Win, "or into a choir as

contralto from the other. If not—oh, well, every one says America's

the country for women."
"Yes, it is. We have splendid fun," Ena assured her. "The men are so

kind to us."
"I think they must be," Win agreed. "Mr. Rolls has been very kind. Are

all the rest like him?"
"I—suppose they have different ways of being kind—some of them. Some

may be safer than others. I hardly know how to put it!"
"I think I understand."
"I—wonder if you do. Oh, Miss Child, I wish I dared speak to you

frankly!"
When people begin thus there is invariably something disagreeable to

follow; but Winifred Child braced herself and said calmly: "Please

do."
"It's very difficult. I'm quite afraid of you."
"It's I who ought to be afraid of you."
"Don't be! I wish I could make you trust me. Can I?"
"Why not?"
"I'm throwing things at you so suddenly. But what else can I do? We

haven't much time. My brother'll come back and join us. And—it's

about him I want to speak. He's so—interested in you."
"That's very nice of him." Winifred's voice was as cold and bright as

a very small icicle.
"It ought to be! But—well, he's a dear brother and a splendid

fellow in many ways. I hate to say anything against him. Yet I'd hate

still more to have you—disappointed. His one fault is—he's rather

foolish about women, especially those not exactly in his own set. Do

you see what I mean? It's so hard for me! He said to-day he was going

to try to help you. That frightened me a little. I felt I must give

you this tiny warning, for Peter has such a trustworthy air, hasn't

he?"
"Yes, indeed he has," answered Win, loyal still to Mr. Balm of Gilead,

alias Peter Pan. But the night had grown colder.
"I'm his sister. I can't help feeling responsible for him. And, in a

way, I feel responsible for you, too, as it's through him I've met

you—and you'll be a stranger in our country. That's why I shouldn't

have dared let this chance pass without speaking. Yet I keep

rambling on without the courage to say much."
"It isn't necessary to dot all the i's and cross the t's," returned

Winifred, trying not to let her voice be sharp or her tone bitter, for

she had to believe that this girl was sincere. A sister would not

blacken the character of a brother for the mere pleasure of hearing

herself talk!
"You do take this as I mean it, don't you?"
"I think so."
"Thank you so much. It's very sweet and generous of you not to be

angry with me and think me a busybody meddling in other people's

business. But it is my business to see that my brother doesn't hurt

a girl who trusts him—a stranger in a strange land. All I want you to

promise is that instead of letting him help you, when he offers to,

as he's sure to do—if he hasn't already—you'll let me do it."
"I'm hoping not to need help, except from the friends of my friend who

has given me introductions," Win justified her pride of womanhood.
"I don't suppose you will need anything else. You look as if you could

get along anywhere. But if you do need a push, promise you won't

accept favours from my brother, or let him come into your life at all.

It's entirely for your own sake I ask."
"I understand that, Miss Rolls. What other reason could there be?"
"There couldn't be any other. Do promise. I'm so frightened for you."
"I shall certainly accept no help from Mr. Rolls."
"That's good! It relieves my mind. And swear you won't let him dream

that I've said anything or interfered with his plans."
"His plans!"
"Well—when a man with Peter's one fault offers to help a girl get

on in New York—Please don't be offended"
"I am not. Of course it goes without saying that I won't let him know

I've had a warning from you."
"He'd never speak to me again if you even gave him a hint."
"Don't be afraid. I won't; not the faintest. Why, we're landing

to-morrow morning early! There won't be a chance to say more than

'Good-bye.'"
"There's to-night, after I go in. He'll be back––"
"I'm going in, too. I shall go when you go."
"Perhaps it would be better. Oh, you don't know what a weight is off

my mind!"
"I'm glad it is gone."
"And you'll write to me, won't you, and let me know how you get

along? Write just what you need. I'll be delighted––"
"If I need anything—thank you."
"My address is Sea Gull Manor, Old Chesterton, Long Island. Shall I

write it down?"
"No, please don't trouble. I can always remember addresses. You're

really very good—to take an interest. And—and I know it must have

been hard for you to—to feel you had to speak."
It was also hard, desperately hard, for Win to pay this tribute to

Miss Rolls's unselfish interest in her moral welfare. She tried to be

grateful, to feel that her late friend's sister had been brave and

fine and unconventional thus to defend a strange girl against one so

near. But despite reason's wise counsel, her heart was hot within her.

She felt like a heathen assured by an earnest missionary that her god

was a myth.
She disliked kind Miss Rolls intensely, and would have loved to let

loose upon her somewhat obtuse head the sarcasm of which at that

moment she felt herself a past mistress. She wanted to be rich and

important and have Miss Rolls, poor and suppliant, at her mercy.

Horrified, she saw by the searchlight of her own anger dark depths of

cruelty and revenge in her own nature. She longed to rush to Peter and

tell him everything, and believe in him again, for it was hard to lose

a friend—an ideal ewe-lamb of a friend. She wished she might wake up

in her overcrowded stateroom and find that this hateful conversation

had been a dream.
But she could not do any of these brutal, silly, or impossible things.

She was not dreaming. All was true. Miss Rolls had meant well, and Mr.

Balm of Gilead did not exist. He was only Peter Rolls, a rich, selfish

fellow who thought girls who had to work fair game. His sister must

know his true inwardness. Probably she had learned through unpleasant

hushed-up experiences, through seeing skeletons unfleshed by Peter

stalk into the family cupboard.
"You ungrateful beast, behave yourself!" Miss Child boxed the ears of

her sulky ego and shook it.
The throaty quiver in the blackbird voice of the dangerous golliwog

went vibrating through Miss Rolls's conscience in a really painful

way. She felt as if she had had a shock of electricity. But, thank

goodness, the worst was over, and now that she had grasped safety (for

instinct said that the girl would not betray), she could afford to be

generous.
She reminded herself that she had acted entirely in self-defence, not

through malice, and she had not told a single lie about Peter. She had

but said—in words—that some men were safer than others, which every

one knew to be true; that Peter was rather foolish about women (so he

was—ridiculously soft, not modern in his ideas at all!), and that it

would be better for the girl to accept help from her—Ena—than from a

young man. It was very good advice, and nothing Peter ought to be

angry about, even if he should ever hear—which, pray heaven, he might

not! As Ena reminded herself how wise and tactful she had been, a

faint glow stole into the chilly zone round her heart, just as you can

heat a cold foot by concentrating yourself on telling it that it is

warm.
"I want to be your friend," she went on sweetly. "Perhaps you aren't

very rich? As girl to girl, let me offer you a little, little

present—or a loan—a hundred dollars. I've got it with me—"
"Oh, thank you many times, but I couldn't possibly!" cried Win. "I

don't need it. I have lots of money."
"I'm glad—though I should have liked the pleasure," said Ena. And she

genuinely would, because the act of giving would have pumped warmth

into the cold place without waiting for time to change the

temperature.
"There's one thing you must let me do, anyhow," she persisted. "That

dress—the 'Blue Moon,' isn't it?—that you tried on and my brother

bought for me, I want you to accept it. Oh, don't say no! It's miles

too long for me" (she couldn't have brought herself to confess that it

was hopelessly small for waist and hips), "and I never enjoy altered

dresses—the style's lost. So you'll not be robbing me. If you won't

have it, I shall believe it's a sign that you're offended at my

interference."
Winifred thought for an instant and drew a long breath. "Then I must

take the dress," she said. "It's more than good of you, of course. I

shan't be in the kind of world where I can wear it, but––"
"Keep it to remember this evening—I mean, to remember me," Miss Rolls

hastily amended.
"I will," said Win simply. But there was no danger that she would ever

forget Miss Rolls—or her kindness.
 
 
CHAPTER V
SCENES FOR A "MOVIE"
When Peter thought that he might decently return to B deck without

breaking into charming womanly confidences, it was deserted. The moon

was struggling out through black clouds and pouring silver into the

sea's ink, but the girl in the moon was gone.
When he found Ena again—which was easy because of the ruby cloak—she

was sitting between Raygan and Lady Eileen on the boat deck. He knew

that she would be annoyed if he mentioned Miss Child in this

distinguished company, and, in any case, he would not have cared to

speak of the girl there.
Realizing that he had kept away too long and lost his chance of seeing

Miss Child again that night, he consoled himself by knocking at Ena's

door when she had evaded him and sought sanctuary in her cabin. She

let him in at once, not because she wanted to do so, but because he

would "turn suspicious" if she made an excuse to keep him out.
"Well?" said he. "What did you think of her?"
"Miss Child? She seems a very nice girl, and you're perfectly

right—she is a lady. I don't know if she's quite as young as you

think, and I don't call her pretty; but she is attractive in spite

of being so awfully tall. We had a pleasant talk, and I offered to do

anything I could. I gave her our address, and she is to write."
"Did you tell her you'd invite her down?" Peter put this question

diffidently.
"I—intimated it. She was rather independent but very nice, and said

she was grateful, especially after I insisted on giving her that

'Moon' dress, which now I've sent to her cabin. You know, she has

friends in New York, and seems to know just what she wants to do, so I

couldn't thrust myself upon her. But I think I did the right thing."
"I'm sure of that, you dear girl," said Peter.
And so was the dear girl herself.
Next morning the room of the mirrors was destitute of dryads. Its once

crowded wardrobes were empty; the huge screen was folded and leaning

against the wall. The dryad door stood open (as Peter Rolls observed

when he "happened" to pass, about the time the Monarchic neared the

Statue of Liberty) and nothing reminiscent remained save a haunting

perfume of "Rose-Nadine" sachet powder, a specialty which might have

been the lingering wraith of a dryad.
As the visions had vanished with all their belongings, Peter thought

it probable they would be on some deck or other watching for the New

York skyscrapers. And he was right concerning four of his model

acquaintances. The fifth was not visible, and Miss Devereux explained

her absence by saying that she was "lazy."
"She's on her own now, you know," she added, "and can sleep as late as

she likes. But I wouldn't miss the first sight of New York for a

pound! Some people have no romance in them."
Up till the last minute Peter had hopes of B deck; but they were

blighted and disappointed, even depressed; he had to land with Ena and

her friends without having seen Miss Child. Still, there was the pier,

crowded with people who had come to wave welcome to the Monarchic.

There appeared to be a fearful confusion, and this was Peter's first

return from his first trip abroad; but he knew that the excited throng

would soon be sorted out under letters of the alphabet.
Peter senior had come to meet his returning children and the

distinguished guests Marconi had bestowed on him (a little, dry, thin

man, who looked as though a lost resemblance to Peter might come out

if he were freshened up by being soaked for a long time in warm

water), and he had already secured a tame official to glance

graciously into the luggage. After shaking heartily the small bag of

bones that was his father's hand, and saying "Hello, Dad! How's

yourself? How's mother? How's everything?" Peter was free for a few

minutes to sprint from "B" to "C."
His spirit rose at the comparative dearth of "C's." Not more than a

dozen of the crowded Monarchic's passengers were dancing with

impatience beneath the third letter of the alphabet, and Mr. Rolls,

Jr., walked straight up to tall Miss Child without being beaten back

by a surf of "C's." To be sure, Miss Carroll was under the same

letter, and observed the approach of Peter with interest, if not

surprise; but she was seated on a trunk at some distance key in hand.
"Well, I'm mighty glad to find you!" exclaimed Peter cordially. "I

began to think it must be a trick of dryads to wait themselves ashore

without waiting for the clumsy old ship to dock."
"I was busy packing this morning," replied the alleged dryad, with a

hard, undryadic expression on her "heart-shaped" face.
"You disappeared so early last night, I'd an idea you were doing your

packing then so as to be up with the dawn and get a good look at the

harbour."
"I could see a great deal from our porthole."
"I shouldn't have thought you were the kind of girl to be satisfied

with portholes," said Peter, hoping to wake up one of her smiles. Her

voice sounded rather tired.
"Beggars mustn't be choosers," was the dry reply.
"But dryads may be," he encouraged her.
"I've left my dryadhood hanging up behind the door." She spoke

sharply, almost irritably, it seemed. "I shan't need it in New York."
"Oh, won't you? That's where you're mistaken! There'll be lots of

times when you'd rather have it than the grandest opera cloak."
"I shan't need an opera cloak, either."
Peter was still smiling, though less confident of the old friendly

understanding which had given them a language of their own with words

which would have been nonsense for others.
"We'll see. Anyhow, I shall ask you to go to the very first

worth-while opera that comes along. Consider it a formal invitation."
"Very well, I will, and answer it formally. 'Miss Child thanks Mr.

Rolls for his kind invitation, and regrets that a previous engagement

makes it impossible for her to accept.'"
"By Jove, that does sound formal enough! How do you know you'll have a

previous engagement?"
"I'm perfectly certain I shall."
This was the real thing! There was no joke in the bottom of the

medicine glass.
Peter's face grew red, like a scolded schoolboy's. Winifred (who was

looking at Miss Carroll's trunk, but saw only Mr. Rolls) thought that

he was going to speak out angrily, and perhaps give her a glimpse of

his black heart. She hoped he would, for it would have been a relief;

but he did not.
"Have I done anything to offend you?" he asked with a straight look;

and though he spoke in a low tone, it was not a secret tone at all.
"No, certainly not," she answered, opening her eyes at him. "Why do

you ask?"
"Because—you weren't like this on the ship."
"I've left my ship manners hanging up behind the door with my

dryadhood. I shan't use them in New York, either!"
"Well—I'm sorry!"
"I don't know why you should be." If she had not stared hard at Miss

Carroll's trunk, and tried anxiously to make out the name on a very

small label, she would have done what she had boasted of never doing,

whatever the world did to her: she would have cried. As it was, she

wore the expression of a budding basilisk.
"Don't you know? Well, then, you didn't realize what it meant to me

to have you for a friend."
"I really didn't think much about it, Mr. Rolls!"
"Evidently not. But I did. Look here, Miss Child. Did my sister put

you against me—or our friendship—in any way?"
"What an extraordinary idea!" sneered Winifred. "She spoke very nicely

of you, as far as I can remember, and said you were a dear brother."
"Then why are you so unkind to me now after being nice on the ship?"
"Oh, that! It was for a cinema, a motion picture. Didn't you

understand?"
This slapped Peter in the face: that she should retort with flippant

slang, when he was earnestly begging for an explanation. At last she

had succeeded in freezing him.
"I'm afraid I didn't quite understand," he said in a new tone which

she had not heard before. Mr. Balm of Gilead, alias Peter Pan, had

suddenly grown up, and as Peter Rolls, Jr., was all politeness and

conventionality.
"I do understand now, though. Well, Miss Child, I must—thank that

'cinema' for some very pleasant hours. Here comes a man to look at

your baggage. Just remind him that you're a British subject, and he

won't make you any trouble. Neither will I!" Peter's hat was off, but

his smile could have been knocked off only with a hammer.
"Good-bye," replied Win hastily, frightened at her own appalling

success as a basilisk. "And thank you—for your part of the cinema."
"I'm afraid I don't deserve any credit. Good-bye. And good luck."
He was gone—but no, not quite. Without turning round to look at her

again, he was stopping to speak with the Irish-faced servant of the

customs. The latter nodded and even touched his cap. Peter Rolls

certainly had a way with him. But Win already knew this, to her

sorrow. She was glad she had thought of that horrid speech about the

cinema. The man deserved it.
"That's the last I shall see of him!" she said to herself almost

viciously, as the Irish-American official spied upon her toque the

wing of a fowl domesticated since the ark. Yet for the second time

Peter came back, stiffly lifting his hat.
"I only wanted to say," he explained, "that, cinema or no cinema, I

hope, if I can be of service now or later, you will allow me the

privilege. My address––"
"I have your sister's, thank you," she cut his words short as with a

pair of scissors. "That's the same thing, isn't it?"
"Yes," he answered heavily—perhaps guiltily. And this time he was

gone for good.
"What a neat expression," thought Winifred. "Gone for good!"
It sounded like a long time.
 
 
CHAPTER VI
THE HANDS WITH THE RINGS
Peter Rolls, Jr., unlike his father, had practically no talent for

revenge. In common with every warm-blooded creature lower than the

angels, he could be fiercely vindictive for a minute or two—long

enough, when a small boy, to give a bloody nose and to get one; long

enough, at all ages, to want to hit a man, thoroughly smash him,

perhaps, or even to kick him into the middle of next week; long enough

to feel that he would like to make a woman sorry that she had been

rude.
But there was always a spiritual and mental reckoning of a painful

description: a soul's housecleaning which turned him out of doors a

miserable waif; and it invariably came too soon, before he had had

time to gloat over the blood on another boy's nose, or a man's

humiliation, or a woman's repentant blush. Instead of heartily

disliking people for the spiteful things they sometimes did, he was

apt to turn round and wonder if the fault had not been his; if he were

not the abysmal beast.
He had not half repaid Winifred Child for her rudeness with his

coldness, yet no sooner was he in the huge gray automobile—which

could comfortably have seated eight instead of six—than he felt a

pang of remorse, exactly like a gimlet twisting through his heart from

top to bottom.
"I oughtn't to have left her like that!" he reproached himself. "I

ought to have hung around and seen that everything went all right. She

said she had the address of a good, cheap boarding-house. But it may

have changed. Or it may be full. And, anyway, how will she get there?

She ought to take a cab. But will she? And if she does, won't she fall

dead at the price? I ought to have warned the poor child. There are

shoals of tips I might have put her up to if I hadn't always been

talking about myself. What if she was cross? There must have been a

reason. I must have done something she didn't feel like pointing out

when I asked. What I don't know about women would make three

encyclopedias."
It was too late, however, to act upon second thoughts which might or

might not be "best." Peter was in the automobile, and it had started.

Even if he went back, it would doubtless be only to find Miss Child

gone. He tried to console himself with the fact that Ena had been nice

to the girl, and that Miss Child had said—or anyhow intimated—that

she would write. If she didn't, he could, at worst, find out her

whereabouts by going to Nadine. Superior as Miss Child was to the

other dryads, she would surely keep up communication with them. Miss

Devereux was the sort who might lunch with him on the strength of "old

friendship." He would give her oysters and orchids, and find out how

things were going with the girl who had left her dryadhood behind the

cabin door.
He tried to console himself with these arguments, but the pleasure of

homecoming was spoiled. Father did not show any very exuberant joy at

seeing him again, and it was disappointing to a warm-hearted nature

if people were not exuberant, even for a minute, when you had been

away for months.
The automobile, with its gray-silk cushions, its immense plate-glass

windows, its travelling boudoir of mirrors, gold scent bottles, and

other idiocies, its bouncing bouquet of fresh violets, its electric

fittings, its air pillow embroidered with silver monograms and crests,

its brocade-lined chinchilla rugs, tricky little extra seats, and

marvellous springs, struck Peter as disgustingly ostentatious.
He wondered what Raygan and his mother and sister would think of folks

in a democratic country using chinchilla for automobile rugs; and he

was sure they must be having interior hysterics over the Rolls coat of

arms—a dragon holding up a spiky crown of some nondescript sort on a

cushion. The dragon looked rather like a frog rampant, and the crowned

cushion bore a singular resemblance to a mushroom with an angry

ladybird on its apex. How this family insignia had been obtained Peter

did not know. His ribald questions had been treated by his sister with

silent scorn. He would not be surprised if Ena had designed the thing

herself!
As the car smoothly bowled Peter out of Winifred Child's life, away

toward the Long Island manor house and the welcome mother would give,

the deposed dryad was having her first experience of New York.
She parted company on the pier with Nadine (in private life Lady

Darling), Nadine's manageress, Miss Sorel, and the quartet of models.

They had almost forgotten her before they had gone two blocks

"uptown"; and she had no reason to remember any of them with

affection, except, perhaps, Miss Sorel, a relative of her one-time

dressmaker who had "got her the job."
Win had heard that the cost of cabs was "something awful" in America,

but she said to herself: "Just this first time I must have one." A

bad night and the scene with Peter had dimmed the flame of her

courage, and she felt a sinking of the heart instead of a sense of

adventure in the thought of taking a "trolley." She would be sure to

lose herself in searching for the boarding-house.
Her luggage—checked and in the hypnotic power of a virile

expressman—had already vanished. It would arrive at its destination

ahead of her. Perhaps there was no room there. In that case it would

be sent away. Dreadful picture! False economy not to take a cab! Win

supposed that a taxi would be no dearer than the horse variety and one

would sooner learn the secrets of the future.
One of these secrets began to hint at its own hideous nature with

every convulsive tick of the metre. It hiccuped nickels, and as Win's

terrified eyes, instead of taking in New York, watched the spendthrift

contrivance yelping for her dollars, she remembered that she owned but

two hundred. She had had to be "decent" about tips on board. But forty

pounds—two hundred dollars—had looked magnificent in her hand bag

that morning. Paper money spread itself in such a lordly manner and

seemed able to buy so many separate things. But by the time the

merciless taxi had bumped her through devious ways up to Fifty-Fourth

Street, three of the beautiful green dollar bills were as good as

gone.
She longed to pray "Oh, do stop taxying!" at the doorstep before she

darted up to inquire whether Miss Hampshire still kept the

boarding-house; and it was maddening to hear that "teuf, teuf"

desperately going on, chewing its silver cud, in the long pause before

an answer came to the bell.
A black woman who flung open the door was startling as a

jack-in-the-box for the English girl. Win had thought of American

negroes but vaguely, as a social problem in the newspapers or dear

creatures in Thomas Nelson Page's books. What with the surprise and

the nervous strain of the disappearing dollars, she asked no further

questions after the welcome news that Miss Hampshire existed and had a

"room to rent." Hastily she paid off the chauffeur, adding something

for himself (it seemed like tipping the man at the guillotine) and

breathed again only when her trunk and dressing-bag blocked the narrow

hall.
"I'm sure I don't see whoever's goin' to tote them things up to the

third story," sighed the female jack-in-the-box, who was, after all,

more purple than black when you looked closely, an illusion produced

by a dusting of pink powder over a dark surface. "And how do I know

Miss Hampshire'll take you?"
"But you said there was a room." The freeborn independence of a whole

nation, irrespective of colour, shocked the effete stranger's breath

away. She gasped slightly.
"Yeh. But that ain't to say you can have it. Miss Hampshire's mighty

pertickler about her woman boarders," explained the purple lady. "You

catched me all of a heap or I wouldn't o' let that feller slam yer

things into the house and git away. You'll have to wait till I call

Miss Hampshire. She'll talk to you."
"Tell her I was recommended by Miss Ellis, from London who boarded

here three years ago," Win desperately tossed after a disappearing

figure.
It was a mortifying commentary upon her personal appearance not to be

invited to wait in the drawing-room, and Miss Child wondered what

foreign strangeness in hat, hair arrangement, or costume had excited

suspicion. She did not know whether to be more angry or amused, but

recalled her own motto, "Laugh at the world to keep it from laughing

first."
Suddenly the episode became part of an adventure, a great and wildly

funny adventure, of which she was dying to see the next part. How she

would love to tell Mr. Balm of Gilead! How his eyes would twinkle!

But—there was no Mr. Balm of Gilead in this or any world. It was a

dreary hall she stood in, with varnished brown paper pretending to be

oak panels, a long-armed hatrack that would have made an ideal

scarecrow, and ghosts of past dinners floating up from below with

gloomy warnings.
From the same region came Miss Hampshire, smelling slightly of Irish

stew. She was pale with the pallor which means shut windows and

furnace heat, a little sharp-nosed, neat-headed woman in brown, whose

extraordinarily deep-set eyes were circled with black, like spectacle

rims. She was graciously willing to accept a guest recommended by Miss

Ellis, hinting that, as she was of British ancestry, the English for

her came under the favoured nation clause.
"To you the room with board'll be ten dollars a week," she said with

flattering emphasis. "A well-known poetess has just left it to be

married. It's not large, but, being at the back of the house, it's

nice and quiet."
When Win was shown the third-floor back hall bedroom she saw that

even a poetess of passion might have snapped at her first proposal. As

Miss Hampshire said, it was not large; but there was the advantage of

being able to reach anything anywhere while sitting on the bed, and

unless the people six feet distant in a back room of the opposite

house snored at night it ought to be quiet.
Win christened her room the "frying pan," because to search for

another boarding-house might be jumping into the fire. And luckily her

trunk would just squeeze under the bed.
"I suppose it would be no use calling on a business man before three

o'clock?" She applied to Miss Hampshire for advice when she had

unpacked her toothbrush and a few small things for which she could

find niche or wall space.
"Before three? And why not?" The pale lady opened her eyes in their

dark caverns.
"Why, I only thought they wouldn't be back in their offices from

luncheon," explained the English girl.
"When you know a little more about N'York," replied Miss Hampshire,

whose manner was involuntarily less mellow when she had hooked a fish,

"you'll see why it could never be run as it is along those lines.

Many of our most prominent business men consider a piece of pie with a

tumbler of milk a good and sufficient lunch, and it takes them five

minutes to swallow it."
Primed with this information and intricate instructions concerning

street cars (a child once burned dreads a taxi), Winifred started out

soon after her own midday meal, eaten in a basement dining-room.
She went first to see the editor; for somehow newspaper reporting

seemed more congenial to the vivid New York climate than singing in a

church choir, and the hugeness of the To-day and To-morrow building

turned her again into a worm. It did not so much scrape the sky as

soar into it, and when she timidly murmured the words "editorial

offices" she was shot up to the top in an elevator as in a

perpendicularly directed catapult.
When the fearsome thing stopped she had the sensation that her head

alone had arrived, the rest had been shed on the way, but in a large

open space furnished with roll-top desks and typewriters and men and

girls she was looked at as though nothing unusual had happened.
"A letter of introduction for Mr. Burritt?" repeated a young man with

a whimsical expression. "I'm afraid you'll have to go higher up to

deliver it."
"I thought I'd got to the top," said Win. "Or"—and she tried to catch

the office note of sprightliness—"does he inhabit a roof garden?"
The young man smiled. "He used to be fond of them after office hours.

But not being a spiritualist, I haven't heard from him concerning his

present habits."
"He is—dead?"
"That's about it," said the young man. "A year ago. But he was only

our city editor, so maybe he didn't get a black border in your English

papers."
Miss Child did not ask how one knew that she was English. She

recovered herself, thought of taking leave, and then decided not to be

precipitate. Instead, she inquired if she could see any other editor.
"Which other have you got a letter to?" the young man temporized.
"None. But––"
"Then I'm afraid it's no use without an appointment. Anyhow, this

isn't the right hour to snapshot editors of daily papers. They're

night-blooming flowers. Would you like to try for an appointment with

Mr. Shaw, Burritt's successor?"
Win thanked him, but thought it would be no use. She would have liked

to walk down, only there seemed to be no stairs. A merry youth who ran

the nearest elevator asked if she would care to use the fire-escape.
The address of Mr. Noble, the organist, was that of a private house.

It was a far cry from To-day and To-morrow, up in the hundreds, and

Miss Hampshire had told Miss Child to take the elevated. Easier said

than done. You could go up the steps and reach a platform on top of

the improved Roman viaduct, but there were so many other people intent

on squeezing through the iron gate and onto the uptown train—people

far more indomitable than yourself—that nothing happened except the

slam, slam of that gate in your face.
At last, however, Miss Child was borne along with a rush from behind

and found herself swinging back and forth like a pendulum on a strap

which she clutched wildly. Men in America were supposed to jump up and

give women their seats, but there were no men in this train. It was

peopled with women who had been shopping, and who carried bundles.

Many went on so far that Win began to believe they were taking a jaunt

for fun, especially as they did not seem at all tired, but chewed

something unremittingly with an air of calm delight. This was,

perhaps, what Americans called a "joy ride!"
There seemed to be no end to New York, and vistas of cross streets

looked so much alike that Win did not wonder they were named only with

numbers. She wanted One Hundred and Thirty-Third Street, and Mr.

Noble's house was a long way from the elevated station. When she found

it at last it was only to learn that six months ago the organist had

accepted a position in Chicago. And New York seemed twice as big,

twice as absent-minded, when both letters of introduction had failed.
Win had often tried to check her tendency to over-optimism by telling

herself that neither Mr. Burritt nor Mr. Noble might have work to

give. But Miss Ellis (now comfortably married in London) had said they

were kind men. If they had nothing to offer, they would certainly

introduce Miss Child to some one who had. It had never occurred to her

that they might thoughtlessly have died or gone elsewhere. Editors and

organists seemed so importantly permanent to the lay mind.
This was indeed being alone in New York! And at the very thought—now

she could guess what it might be like—her one hundred and ninety-six

dollars and twenty-eight cents seemed to be shrinking in the wash.
"Nonsense!" said she, on the elevated again, tearing downtown. "Don't

be a silly. Any one would think you were the leading lady in a

melodrama, turned out of the house without your hat, in a snowstorm

that followed you round the stage like a wasp! You'll be all right.

Miss Ellis told you they loved English girls in New York. Just you

wait till to-morrow, my dear!"
The rest of the day she spent in the frying pan, "pulling herself

together," and "seeing where she stood," a process consisting mostly

of counting her greenbacks and comparing them with their equivalent in

English money. After all, there was not too much time for this mental

adjustment of things, because, being late in October, darkness fell

early, and Miss Hampshire's boarders dined at six-thirty. Promptness

was obligatory if you were a female. A little more latitude—a raising

of the eyebrows instead of a frown—was granted if you were fortunate

enough to be of the opposite sex. Miss Hampshire's sad smile seemed to

concede that men had temptations.
There were bank clerks and schoolteachers and translators though no

more poetesses; and everybody was kind to the new boarder, the

Englishwoman, especially in telling her all about New York.
"What do you think of Broadway?" asked her neighbour a handsome young

German Jew, who was more insistently American than any of those native

born.
Win was shamefacedly not sure whether she had seen it.
"Not sure whether you have seen Broadway!" exclaimed Mr. Löwenfeld.

"Wait till you've been on the Great White Way after dark. Then I

guess you won't make any mistake."
"Is it so wonderful?" she asked.
"I should smile! There's nothing like it on earth. Would you like to

walk out and see it to-night? Miss Secker and I'll take you, if you

would, won't we, Miss Secker?"
"Only too pleased," rather shrilly replied a fair-haired girl on his

other side—a pretty girl in eyeglasses who, Miss Hampshire had

announced, was "translating secretary" for a firm of toy importers.

Somehow the tone suggested to Win an incipient engagement of marriage

and jealousy of new importations.
But Mr. Löwenfeld had spoken no more than the truth. Broadway at

night, seen as a pedestrian at the side of Miss Secker, was

astonishing, was marvellous, was unique. The whole sky was alight and

pulsing with its magnificence. Twenty moons would not have been

noticed. Everything that could happen was happening by electricity. It

was Crystal Palace Fireworks, and the Lord Mayor's Show, and

Coronation, and Mafeking, and naval manoeuvres with searchlights, all

flashing and flaming, blazing and gyrating at the same time. Broadway

gleamed white as the north pole, jewelled with rainbow colours,

amazing rubies, emeralds, topazes, grouped in letters or forming

pictures on invisible frames rising high above tall buildings or

appearing on their façades.
Green sea waves billowed brightly, a giant cat winked golden eyes, two

brilliant boxers fought an endless round, a dazzling girl put on and

took off illuminated gloves; a darky's head, as big as a balloon, ate

a special brand of pickled melon; a blue umbrella opened and shut; a

great gilded basket dropped ruby roses (Buy them at Perrin Frères); a

Japanese Geisha, twice life-size, told you where to get kimonos; a

trout larger than a whale appeared and disappeared on a patent hook;

and above all, brighter than all, rose against the paling sky from

somewhere behind Broadway a pair of titanic hands.
These hands fascinated Win. They beckoned her gaze and held it. Slowly

they came up and drew attention to themselves, silently filching it

from Broadway's emblems of business success. The stranger in New York

stopped involuntarily as if hypnotized, watching for the ten colossal

outspread fingers to materialize on their unseen frames; to become

hands, with wrists and upraised arms; and then to drop out of sight,

like the last appeal for help of a drowning Atlas who had lost his

grip on the globe.
Yet this immense, arresting gesture was never the last. Three seconds

gone, then blazing back again, came fingers, hands, wrists, arms. And

on every one of the ten fingers (including thumbs) flashed a huge

ring, each different from the other in colour and design. Each ring

was adorned with a jewelled letter, and as the hands reached toward

the zenith the colour of the rings changed rapidly twice. It was

impossible to remove the eyes from this sign until the gesture pageant

had completed itself. To the lost dryad New York seemed dominated by

Peter Rolls's Hands.
 
 
CHAPTER VII
THE TWO PETERS
The hands of Peter Rolls!
They had Winifred Child's imagination in their grip. Sleeping and

waking, she saw the glitter of their rings. For on her first night in

New York Mr. Löwenfeld told her a story about the hands.
They were the hands of Peter senior. His commercial genius had spread

them across the sky to beckon the public to his great new department

store on Sixth Avenue. Just as at the beginning of the gesture you saw

only the tips of the fingers, so Peter Rolls, Sr., had begun with a

tiny flicker, the first groping of his inspiration feeling its way to

success.
Everybody in the United States had heard of Peter Rolls, or it was not

the fault of the magazines and Sunday papers. Peter Rolls had been for

years one of the greatest advertisers in America. Mr. Winfield didn't

see how, even on a remote little island like England, Miss Child could

have escaped hearing about Peter Rolls's hands. This had now become

the snappy way of saying that you intended to shop at Peter Rolls's

store: "I'm going to the Hands." "I'll get that at the Hands." And

Peter Rolls had emphasized the phrase on the public tongue by his

method of advertising.
Each advertisement that appeared took the same form—a square space

heavily outlined in black or colour, held up by a pair of ringed

hands, facsimiles in miniature of his famous sky sign. And the several

thousand salespeople in the huge store were slangily nicknamed "Peter

Rolls's hands." But naturally these insignificant morsels of the great

mosaic were not spelled with a capital H, unless, perhaps by

themselves, and once when a vaudeville favourite sang a song, "I'm a

Hand, I'm a Hand." It was a smart song, and made a hit; but Peter

Rolls was said to have paid both the star and the management.
Apparently nothing concerning Peter Rolls, Sr., and his family was

hidden from Mr. Löwenfeld and Miss Seeker, although they claimed no

personal acquaintance with the great. Probably, if Win had asked, they

could have told how many servants Mrs. Rolls kept and how many cases

of champagne her husband ordered in a year. But questions were

unnecessary. The subject of a self-made millionaire was a fascinating

one to the lately naturalized German.
Peter Rolls, Sr., had emigrated from the north of Ireland as a young

boy. He had contrived to buy a few cheap odds and ends likely to

attract women buried in the country far from shops. He had somehow

known exactly what odds and ends to select. That was genius; and he

had coined money as a peddler. In his wandering life he made

acquaintance with many tramps and saw how he might make even the

lowest useful. After a few years he scraped up enough capital to start

a small store in New York, far downtown, where rents were cheap.
Like his peddler's pack, the store was stocked with odds and ends.

But again they were just the right odds and ends, the odds and ends

that every one in that neighbourhood wanted and had never been able to

obtain under one roof. No article cost less than five cents, none more

than a dollar, and it was marvellous what Peter Rolls could afford to

sell for a dollar.
"I Can Furnish Your Flat for Ten Dollars. Why? Because I Work with My

Own Hands," was Peter Rolls's first advertisement. And the Hands had

never lost their cunning since.
He could undersell any other shopkeeper in New York because he got his

salesmen for next to nothing. They were a judicious selection from

among his friends, the tramps. Any man who could recall enough of his

schooling to do a little sum in addition was eligible. He was fed,

clothed, tobaccoed, judiciously beered, watched all day while at work,

and shut up at night in a fireproof, drink-proof cubicle. The plan

proved a brilliant success. The little store downtown became a big

one, and grew bigger and bigger, swallowing all the other stores in

its block; and it was now ten years since the great Sixth Avenue

department store, which could call itself the largest in New York, was

opened under the benediction of the Hands.
Winifred had fancied, because of the balm which was making a fortune,

that Peter Rolls, Sr., was some sort of a glorified chemist. But Mr.

Löwenfeld roared at this idea. The Balm of Gilead was only one of the

lucky hits in the drug department, in itself as big as a good-sized

provincial store. The Hands sold everything, and though the tramps

were long ago dead or abolished, Peter Rolls still undersold every

other store in New York. How did he do it? Well—there were ways.

The hands without a capital H might tell, perhaps; but they did not

talk much. Peter Rolls never had any difficulty in obtaining or

keeping as many of them as he wanted, and could get double the number

if he liked.
"Does he still 'work with his own hands?'" quoted Win at last, feeling

half guilty, as if she ought not to ask questions about Peter's father

behind Peter's back. But the affairs of the Rolls family seemed to be

public property. Mr. Löwenfeld and Miss Seeker both laughed.
"I should love," said the latter, "to see Ena Rolls's face if her

father did work! She spells their name with an 'e'—R-o-l-l-e-s—and

hopes the smart set on Long Island, where their new palace is, won't

realize they're the Hands. Isn't it ridiculous? Like an ostrich hiding

its head in the sand. She runs her father and mother socially. I guess

the old man hardly dares put his nose inside the store, except about

once a year; and Ena and the old lady never buy a pin there. As for

the young fellow, they say he doesn't bother: hates business and wants

to be a philanthropist or something outlandish on his own. I should

say to him, if he asked me: 'Charity begins at home.'"
Those last two sentences spoken by Miss Emma Seeker on Winifred

Child's first night in New York had as direct an effect upon the

girl's life as if the ringed hands had come down out of the sky and

clutched her dress. She did not attach much importance to the words at

the time, except to think it snobbish of Miss Rolls and weak of her

mother never to show themselves under the roof where their fortune was

being piled up. Also, she thought it disappointing of Peter junior not

to "bother" about the business which had been his father's life work.

But then Peter was altogether disappointing, as Miss Rolls (with an

"e") had disinterestedly warned her.
It was not until Win had been in New York for a month that the

influence of Miss Seeker's words made itself felt, and the Hands gave

their twitch at the hem of her dress. They had been on her mind often

enough during the four weeks—morning, noon, and night—but she had

never known that she was physically within touching distance.
The "happy omen" of getting her passage to New York free had stopped

working on the Monarchic. Since then bad luck had walked after her

and jumped onto her lap and purred on her pillow, exactly like a cat

that persistently clings to a person who dislikes it. All the

positions which she was competent to fill were filled already. Only

those she could not undertake seemed to be open. She tried to sing,

she tried to teach, she tried to report news, she tried to be a

publisher's reader, and to get work in a public library. She tried to

make hats, she tried to act, but nobody wanted her to do any of these

things, unless, perhaps, she went away and trained hard for a year.

When matters began to look desperate, and not till then, she applied

to Nadine.
But Lady Darling had gone back to England, and Miss Sorel, not having

recovered her health after the great tossing at sea, had been replaced

by a brand-new American manageress. No more models were wanted. There

was nothing that Miss Child could do, and the only result of her visit

was delight in the heart of Miss Devereux because "that queer Child

girl was laughing on the wrong side of her mouth." The new manageress

was so preoccupied in manner and so sure that Miss Child's services

would not be needed that Win did not even leave her address. Besides,

as it happened, she had given Miss Hampshire "notice," and had not yet

found another boarding-house.
"I think I ought to try to get into a cheaper place," she explained.

And that was a reason; but another, just as important, was pretty Miss

Seeker's jealousy because Mr. Löwenfeld talked too much to the English

girl at the table.
After all, the best that Win could accomplish after three days' dismal

search was a saving of two dollars a week. For eight dollars she

secured a fourth-story back hall bedroom half as big and half as clean

as Miss Hampshire's, and she laughed aloud to find herself feeling

desperately homesick for the "frying pan." For Win could still laugh.
It was counting her money, the day after a servant at the new

boarding-house stole twenty dollars, that whisked Miss Child's skirt

within reach of the Hands. Things could not go on like this. She must

get something to do at once—no matter what. Another girl in that

house bought newspapers for the sake of the employment notices.

Winifred borrowed the papers and answered many of the most attractive

offers in vain. Next she tried the less attractive ones. When they

were used up—and she also—she came down to what she called bed rock.
In bed rock were advertisements of several large stores for extra help

through the holiday season. Of these Peter Rolls's store was at the

head. "The Hands want hands," was part of the appeal, and Win

instantly turned to something else. It was not until she had applied

for work at six other shops, and found herself too late at all, that

it began to seem faintly possible for her to think of going to Peter

Rolls's father's store.
When the idea did knock at the door of her mind hesitatingly as Peter

junior used to knock at the dryad door, the Hands' advertisement for

help was the last of its kind in the papers. The Hands needed more

hands than any of the other stores.
When Win was just about to say to herself, "That's the one thing I

couldn't do," she remembered Miss Seeker's words. Miss Rolls ruled her

father and mother socially. Peter senior was allowed to show his nose

in the place only about once a year. Mrs. and Miss Rolls never bought

a pin there. Young Peter didn't bother, but wanted to be a

philanthropist. In fact, you would, apparently, be far more likely to

meet a member of the Rolls family in any other shop than their own.
Instead of saying that she could not, Win said: "Why shouldn't I?" She

told herself that in a vast house of business which employed over two

thousand salespeople she would be a needle in a haystack—a needle

with a number, not a name. "I'll go and ask for a place," she answered

her own question.
But almost she hoped that she would not succeed. If she tried, failure

would not be her fault.
 
 
CHAPTER VIII
NO. 2884
Morning and girl were gray with cold as Win hovered before the vast

expanse of plate glass which made of Peter Rolls's department store a

crystal palace. Customers would not be admitted for an hour, yet the

lovely wax ladies and the thrilling wax men in the window world wore

the air of never having stopped doing their life work since they were

appointed to it.
But then they had a life work of the most charming description.

Winifred envied them. It was indeed their business to make all men,

women, and children who passed envy them enough to stop, enter the

store, and purchase things to make real life as much as possible like

life in the window world.
All the nicest things which could be done in the strenuous outside

world could in a serene and silent way be done in window world. And

the lovely ladies and their thrilling men had not to hustle from one

corner of the earth to another in order to find different amusements.
In one section of plate-glass existence beautiful girls were being

dressed by their maids for a ball. Some were almost ready to start.

Exquisite cloaks were being folded about their shoulders by

fascinating French soubrettes with little lace caps like dabs of

whipped cream. Other willowy creatures were lazy enough to be still in

filmy "princess" petticoats and long, weblike, silk corsets

ensheathing their figures nearly to their knees. A realistic

dressing-table, a lace-canopied bed, and pale-blue curtains formed

their background. Instead of having to rush half across New York to

the dance, it was apparently taking place next door, with only a thin

partition as a wall.
In a somewhat Louis Seize room several wondrous wax girls and the same

number of young men, with extremely broad shoulders and slender hips,

were dancing a decorous tango. But, if they tired of that, they had

only to move on a section, to find a party of four young people

playing tennis in appropriate costumes against a trellis of crimson

ramblers. Strange to say, a mere wall divided this summer scene from

sports in the high Alps. There was gorgeous fun going on in this

portion of window world, where men and girls were skeeing,

tobogganing, and snowballing each other in deep cotton snow. Next door

they were skating on a surface so mirrorlike that, in fact, it was a

mirror.
A little farther on a young wax mother of no more than eighteen was in

a nursery, caressing an immense family of wax children of all ages,

from babyhood up to twelve years. A grandmother was there, too, and a

hospital nurse, and several playful dogs and cats. In another house

they were having a Christmas tree, and Santa Claus had come in person

to be master of ceremonies. How the children on the other side of a

partition, engaged in learning lessons at school desks, must have

envied those whose Christmas had prematurely come! But best of all was

the automobile race; or, perhaps, the zoo of window world, where

Teddy bears and Teddy monkeys and Teddy snakes and Teddy everythings

disported themselves together among trees and flowers in Peter Rolls's

conception of Eden.
Win had often glanced into these windows before, hurrying nervously

past, but now she lingered, trying to fill her heart with the waxen

peace of that luxurious land of leisure. She walked very slowly all

around the great square, three sides of which were crystal, the fourth

being given up to huge open doors, through which streamed men and

parcels and hurled themselves into motor vans. The idea flashed into

the girl's head that here was the cemetery of window land. In those

big boxes and packages that men furiously yet indifferently carried

out, were the dolls or animals that had smiled or romped behind the

plate glass, or the dresses and hats, the tennis rackets and toboggans

they had fondly thought their own.
This promenade of inspection and introspection put off the evil minute

for a while; but the time came when Win must hook herself on to the

tail of a procession constantly entering at an inconspicuous side

door, or else go home with the project abandoned.
"Of course I shall never see Peter Rolls or his sister here," she

told herself for the twentieth time, and passed through the door

almost on the back of an enormous young man, while a girl closed in

behind her with the intimacy of a sardine.
"Gee! Get on to the tall Effect in brown!" murmured a voice.
"Ain't she the baby doll?" another voice wanted to know.
Winifred heard, and realized that she was the Effect and baby doll in

question. She flushed, and her ears tingled. She thought of the

Arabian Nights tale, where the searcher after the Golden Water was

pestered by voices of those who had been turned to black stones on the

way.
When the cue of tightly packed men and women had advanced along a

corridor on the other side of the doorway, it began mounting a

fireproof staircase. Up and up it went, slowly, steadily rising from

story to story, but it did not spread across the whole width of the

wide, shallow steps. Other men and women, in single file and with no

attention to order, pushed themselves down, the ascending gang

flattening them against the varnished, green wall as they sneaked

hastily past. No one spoke to Win or told her anything (though the big

fellow in front threw her a jovial glance when she trod on his heel,

and she herself ventured a look at the rear sardine), but she knew

somehow that the irregular, descending procession was the defeated

army in flight; those who "would not do." She wondered if she should

be among them after a few hours of vain waiting and standing on her

feet.
Seven flights of stairs she counted, and then she and those in front

and behind debouched into a corridor much longer than that at the

entrance on the ground floor.
"They might have shot us up in the customers' lifts!" snapped the

sardine who had just detached herself from Winifred's spine. "'Twould

have saved their time and our tempers."
"They don't spend money putting up fireproof staircases for nothing,"

mumbled a voice over the sardine's shoulder. "They want to give us a

free exhibition of an emergency exit. But it'll be the only thing we

ever will get free here."
"Except maybe the sack—or the bounce," tittered the sardine.
There was something likable about that sardine. Win felt drawn to her,

which was fortunate in the circumstances.
Nearer and nearer they approached, with a kind of shuffle step, to an

office whose whole front consisted of window. This window was raised,

and electric light streaming out brightened that distant end of the

otherwise economically lit corridor. The advance guard of would-be

hands stepped one at a time in front of a counter which took the place

of a window ledge. Now and then a girl or a man was kept for several

moments talking to a person whom Win could not yet see; a kind of god

in the machine. This halt delayed the procession and meant that a hand

was being engaged; but oftener than not the pause was short, and the

look on the late applicant's face as he or she turned to scurry back

like a chased dog along the corridor told its own story.
Win read each human document, as a page opened and then shut forever

under her eyes, with a sick, cold pang for the tragedy of the

unwanted. She ceased to feel that she was alien to these young men and

women, because they were American and she English. A curious

impression thrilled through her that she and these others and all

dwellers on earth were but so many beads threaded on the same

glittering string, that string the essence of the Creator, uniting all

if they but knew it.
The realization that hearts near hers were beating with hope or dread,

or sinking with disappointment, was so keen that the heavy air of the

place became charged for Win with the electricity of emotion. She felt

what all felt in a strange confusion; and when a stricken face went

by, it was she, Winifred Child, who was stricken. What happened to

others suddenly mattered just as much and in exactly the same degree

as what might happen to her. The weight of sadness and weariness

pressed upon her. The smell of unaired clothes and stale, cheap

perfumes made her head ache.
"Tired, girlie?" inquired the big young man on whose broad back Win

had involuntarily reposed on the way upstairs She was startled at this

manner of address, but the brotherly benevolence on the square face

under a thick brushwood of blond hair reassured her. Evidently

"girlie" was the right word in the right place.
"Not so very. Are you?" She felt that conversation would be a relief.

It was intensely cold yet stuffy in the corridor, and time seemed

endless.
"Me? Huh! Bet yer my place yer can't guess what my job was up to a

month ago."
He turned a strongly cut profile far over his shoulder, his head

pivoting on a great column of throat above a low, loose collar that

had a celluloid gleam where the light touched it. Only one eye and the

transparent gleam of another cornea were given to Winifred's view, but

that one green-gray orb was as compelling as a dozen ordinary seeing

apparatuses.
"If I guessed what's in my mind, I'm afraid it would be silly," said

Win. "You look as if you might be a—a boxer—or––"
"Or what?"
"Or as if you could train things—animals, I mean––"
"Gee-whittaker! If she ain't hit it square in the jaw first round! Go

up ahead, little girl. This is where I move down one."
The sardines were now so loose in their partially emptied box that

they could wriggle and even change positions if they liked. The big

young man wheeled, passed his arm round Winifred's waist as if for a

waltz, half lifted her off her feet, and set her down where he had

been.
"Good gracious!" she gasped.
"That's what you get for bein' a bright child," he explained "The

place is yours. See? If Peter Rolls wants only one more hand when your

turn comes, you're it, and I'm left. I was lion man in Jakes's and

Boon's show, but my best lion died on me, and that kind o' got my

goat. Guess my nerve went; and then brutes is as quick as fleas to

jump if they feel you don't know where you are for once. That shop is

shut for yours truly, so I'm doin' my darnedest to get another. If

Peter Rolls can use me, he can have me dirt cheap. I want to feed my

face again. It needs it!"
"You give Father one straight look between the eyes," suggested the

sardine, now at his back, "sort of as if he was a lion, and I'd bet my

bottom dollar, if I had one, he dasn't hand you the frosty mitt."
"Who's Father?" the lion tamer threw over his shoulder Win had longed

to ask the same question, but had not liked to betray herself as an amateur.
"Oh, I forgot this was your first party! Wish 'twas mine. Father's

what the supe—the superintendent, the gent in the window—gets

himself called by us guyls."
"Wipe me off the map! I'm some Johnny to cost you all that breath.

But gee! the thought of standin' up to him gets my goat worse 'n twice

his weight in lions. I'm mighty glad this young lady's gotta go

through with it in front of me. Say, maybe you'll push the right bell

with him, too."
"I hope we both may," answered Win fervently. "It's more than kind of

you to give me your place, but really I––"
"Ain't we the polite one?" remarked the lion tamer. "Say, girlie,

you've made a hit with me. Where did you buy your swell accent?"
"Don't make fun of me, please, or I shall drop!" exclaimed Win with a

laugh nipped in the bud, lest it should reach the august ear of

Father.
This way of taking the joke appeased those within hearing, who had

perhaps believed that the tall Effect in brown thought a lot of

herself and was putting on airs. Her seeming to imply that she might

be considered ridiculous inclined censors to leniency.
"Have a spruce cream?" asked a girl in front, screwing her head round

to see what the Effect was like, and offering a small, flat object

about an inch in width and two in length.
"Thank you very much," said Win.
Every one near tittered good-naturedly. Perhaps it was that accent

again! Funny, thought Win. Her idea had been that Americans had an

accent, because they didn't talk like English people who had invented

the language. Americans appeared to think it was the other way round!
She put the flat thing into her mouth and began to chew it. At first

it was very nice; sugary, with a fresh, woodsy flavour which was new

to her. Presently, however, the sweetness and some of the taste melted

away, and instead of dissolving, so that she could swallow it, the

substance kept all its bulk and assumed a rubbery texture exactly like

a doll's nose she had once bitten off and never forgotten. She coughed

a little and did not quite know what to do.
"Good heavens', she's goin' to absorb it!" ejaculated the girl in

front, still twisting to gaze at the tall Effect. "Didn't you never

chew gum before?"
"Only millionaires can afford it in my country," said Win, recovering

herself. The laugh was with her! But every sound made was piano.

There was the feeling among the mice that this was the cat's house.
The girl in front who had offered the chewing gum was small and just

missed being very pretty. She had curly hair of so light a red that it

was silvery at the roots. Seeing her from behind, you hoped for a

radiant beauty, but she had pale, prominent eyes and a hard mouth. Win

imagined that the muscles in her cheeks were overdeveloped because of

chewing too much gum.
At last the procession had moved on so far that this girl arrived at

the lighted window. Win's heart, which had missed a beat in a sudden

flurry of fear now and then, began to pound like a hammer.
For the first time she could see the god in the machine, the

superintendent of Peter Rolls's vast store, a kind of prime minister

with more power than the king. She had fancied that he would be old, a

man of such importance in a great establishment, a person who had the

nickname of Father. But her anxious gaze, as she carefully kept her

distance, told that he was not even middle-aged. He was, it seemed, a

curious mixture of cherub and Mephistopheles in type: round faced,

blue eyed, with smooth cheeks that looked pink even in the cruel

electric light. His hair and brushed-up eyebrows were thin and of a

medium brown; but he had a sharply waxed moustache and a little

pointed goatee or "imperial" so much darker in colour that they were

conspicuous objects.
He was talking to the girl in a high-keyed yet somewhat blustering

voice, asking questions which Win could not and did not try to hear.

The answers were given purposely in a low tone, and the girl laid on

the counter several papers from a little black bag at her waist. These

the superintendent took up, unfolding them with plump, dimpled

fingers, like those of a young woman.
With his bright, glancing blue eyes he skimmed the contents of each

paper—probably references, thought Win—and then returned them to

their owner.
"These are no good," he pronounced in a louder voice than before. "And

you don't look strong enough for Christmas work––"
Suddenly the red-haired girl darted her head forward, like that of a

pecking bird, hastily muttered a few words, and drew back, as if

hoping that those not concerned might fail to notice the manoeuvre.
"Oh—er—that's different," said the superintendent in an odd,

uncomfortable tone, with the hint of "bluster" still in it. Win

fancied she heard him add: "What salary?" In any case, the girl

mentioned the sum of eight dollars, and at the same time scribbled

something on a printed paper form pushed over the counter.
"Bet that ain't your line, kid," there came a murmur round the

corner of a velvet bow on Win's hat. So faint was the murmur that she

might almost have dreamed it; but, if uttered, it must have dropped

from heaven or the lion tamer's lips.
Win was burning with curiosity. What two or three talismanic words

could the red-haired girl have whispered so quietly, so secretively,

to change in a second the superintendent's decision? It was almost

like freemasonry. You whispered to the hangman, and he, realizing that

you were a member, took the noose off your neck!
Alas, if Father refused her services, as he almost surely would, she

had no such magic charm to make him change his mind! There was

certainly a mystery, a secret password that did the trick; but the

lion tamer, though a newcomer in this business like herself, appeared

to know or guess, and bet that it "wasn't in her line."
Too late to ask questions! Her time had come. The red-haired girl,

looking prettier than before because of a bright flush on her sallow

face, pranced away, head triumphantly up, and a key and a queer little

book in her hand.
Before Win realized what was happening she stood before the big,

lighted window, longing though not daring to rest her trembling elbows

on the counter. The cherubic yet keen blue eyes were staring into hers

with the oddest expression she had ever seen. If the man had not been

an important official, far above her (he would have thought) in

position, Win might have fancied that he was afraid of her, afraid of

something which he half expected, half dreaded, wishing to avert it,

yet likely to be mortified if it did not come.
"I must be out of my mind," she told herself, at the same time telling

him that she desired an engagement as an extra hand.
"What references?" he inquired, with the mechanical intonation of one

who has put the same question thousands of times.
"I—haven't any," stammered Win. "I'm lately over from England––"
"You don't need to mention that," broke in the superintendent. "I know

London. Have you worked in any of the big department stores

there—Harrods' or Selfridge's?" He looked, Win thought (clinging to a

straw of hope), as if he were not unwilling to help her.
"No, none. I was a model for Nadine. I'm quick at doing figures––"
"The figures that models cut are more to the point, I guess!" The

cherub Mephistopheles smiled at this joke and did not seem to care

just then that his every extra word kept the procession back an extra

instant. "We're not wanting models at present. But if you've had any

experience as a saleslady—you look all right—well, see here, I'll

try and give you a chance. It's up to you to make good, though. What

money do you want? Write it down."
He indicated one of those forms which Win had seen. She hesitated,

then felt that the blue eyes were watching her keenly. Hesitation was

not the way to succeed in this home of hustle. She remembered that

the red-haired girl, though she must have had experience or she would

not have possessed references, had said something about eight dollars.

"I'll say seven," Win told herself, and wrote accordingly on the

paper.
"We can't pay seven dollars per week to a girl without experience,"

pronounced the superintendent promptly. "If you want to take six, I'll

give you a test of character. You ought to be thankful for six. By and

by you may work up into one of the departments where we pay

commissions."
"I'll take six," Win said.
Though already she knew something of the expense of living in New

York, six dollars a week certainly seemed generous compared with

shop-girls' wages at home. She had been told that there they got only

twelve or fourteen shillings, and sometimes less. Of course, in

England, you "lived in." Win had heard that expression, and was aware

of its meaning. She was not yet quite sure what you did in America,

for she had talked to none of her very few acquaintances about the

need she had to look for work in a department store. There was only

one thing she did know in that connection: it would be unwise to ask

Father questions.
She must appear to be "all there," and trust to finding out the

routine of a New York shop-girl's life from one of themselves. She

hoped the sardine would be engaged—nice, trim little sardine with

smooth black pompadour, small white face, jewel-bright eyes,

pugnacious nose, determined chin! A snappy yet somehow trustworthy

sardine.
Still the superintendent was observing her, as if to see whether she

were warranted sound and kind. "I'm going to put you into a bargain

square," said he thoughtfully. "Do you know what that means?"
"I can guess," said she.
"One of our two-hour bargain sales will tell better than anything else

whether you've got stuff in you," he went on. "Have you ever seen a

check book?" was the question now flashed at her.
Win had just sense enough left not to blurt out any nonsense about a

bank. In an instant she realized that the pads upon which salespeople

did hasty sums must be called check books, anyhow in America. She

answered that she had seen one.
"Know what to do with it?"
"On principle. I can soon learn the method."
"Soon's a long word. You may have time for it, your side. We

haven't. Things have gotta be learned on the nail. See here, what

about your dress? Are you wearing black under that jacket?"
Win's heart jumped. She had not expected, if engaged, to begin work

the next moment. She had supposed that she would be told to return the

next morning before the opening hour for customers; otherwise it might

have occurred to her that it would be well to get a ready-made black

dress. But she must not throw away this chance which seemed to be

hanging in the balance.
"No," she answered quickly. "I thought it would be better to buy

something here when I knew just what was wanted. I can find a dress

which will fit, I know. I always can, and I can be in it fifteen

minutes from now."
"Well," the superintendent said with half-grudging approval that lit

a faint twinkle in his eyes, "you're no slow coach for an

Englishwoman. You may do. We sell 10 per cent. off to our employees.

Here's the key of your locker. Here's your check book. When you've got

your dress, ask for the schoolroom. Take fifteen minutes' lesson on

the blackboard for making out your checks, and the rest's up to you.

But look sharp. We've been open to customers for half an hour now. At

ten-thirty a two-hours' bargain sale of blouses, sashes, and ladies'

fancy neckwear opens on the first floor. That's yours. You must be in

the square more than half an hour before the sale begins, to see stock

and learn your job."
He eyed her sharply to see if she were "feazed." But Win had the

feeling that a "stiff upper lip" was needed for the honour of England

and the pluck of its womanhood. She remembered one of the stories she

had loved best as a child—the story of the task Venus set for Psyche

before she could be worthy of Cupid, the lover whose wings she had

burned with a drop of oil from her lamp. Now the girl, grown out of

childhood, understood how Psyche had felt when told to count the

grains of wheat in Venus's granary within a certain time limit.
"Well, anyhow, Psyche didn't ask questions, and I won't," she said to

herself. "The kind ants came and told her things: maybe the sardine

will come to me."
Looking almost preternaturally intelligent and pleased with life, Win

accepted the key and check book, and learned with a shock that, as one

of Peter Rolls's hands, she was No. 2884.
 
 
CHAPTER IX
THE TEST OF CHARACTER
The sardine's ears must have been sharp, for although the lion tamer

was between her and Win (like a thick chunk of ham in a thin

sandwich), she had heard something of the conversation at the

superintendent's window.
"Try the basement bargain counters for your dress; you'll get it

cheaper," she flung after the tall Effect in a shrill whisper as the

newly engaged hand flashed by.
There wasn't a second, or even half a second to lose, yet Win

slackened her pace to say "Thank you. I do hope we shall meet again."
Even the lion tamer threw her a look, though already he had taken his

turn at the window; but Win did not see the admiring glance. She was

flying down the stairs she had come up so slowly, and did not pause

for breath until she was in the basement. There it was so crowded and

so hot, though the store had been open to customers not quite an hour,

that there seemed little air to breathe, even had there been time.
Win could see no means of ventilation in the immense room, which was

brightly and crudely lit by pulsing white globes of electricity. There

were no partitions to divide one department from another, and it

seemed as if samples of every article in the world were being sold on

these rows upon rows of heaped-up tables.
Taking her for a customer, a floorwalker saved the bewildered girl

from wasting more than a minute of her valuable time. The thermometer

of his manner fell a degree when he learned that she was an employee;

nevertheless, he directed her to the bargain counter where black dress

skirts were being sold. There was another nearby which offered black

silk and satin blouses. The man asked if she had been told that extra

hands, if on probation, must give money down for anything above the

first week's wage, and looked impressed when the tall girl answered

that she preferred to pay cash for the whole.
"Princess, queen!" he murmured sotto voce, and Win might have had

the privilege of exchanging a smile with him on the strength of the

joke, but thought it might be wiser not to have heard.
Luckily black skirts and blouses were not the craze of the moment.

Women were besieging a beehive of corsets and a hotbed of petticoats,

reduced (so said huge red letters overhead) to one third of their

original price. In less than five minutes Win had secured a costume

with the right measurements, and for the two portions of which it

consisted, had paid exactly one week's salary.
With an unwrapped parcel rolled under one arm, she battled her way

back to the staircase she had descended (not daring to squeeze her

unworthy body into a crowded elevator), and toiled up to the eighth

floor. There, she had been told, were dressing-rooms as well as

lockers; a rest room (converted into a schoolroom from the hour of

eight until ten), and the restaurant for women employees.
Lightning change act first! Black Effect to take the place of brown,

a rush for the dressing-room, vague impression of near marble basins

and rows of mirrors; tall, slim girl in front of one, quite the proper

"saleslady" air, in new, six-dollar black skirt and silk blouse

lightened with sewed-in frills of white, fit not noticeably bad; dash

along corridor again for locker room, but sudden wavering pause at

sight of confused group: half-fainting girl in black being handed over

to capped and aproned nurse by two youths at an open door, glimpse of

iron bedsteads etched in black against varnished white wall, door shut

with slap; youths marching light heartedly away, keeping time to the

subdued whistle of "Waiting for the Robert E. Lee."
Girls sometimes faint here, then, before ten o'clock in the morning!

And quite a matter of course to shed them in the hospital room,

otherwise one wouldn't try one's tango steps going away. But never

mind; laugh first, or the world will! Life easier for Peter Rolls's

hands as well as other people if they can live it in ragtime. Your

turn to fall to-day. Mine to-morrow. "Waiting for the Robert E. Lee!"

And whatever you may think, don't lose a minute.
Winifred did not. Perhaps she, too, was beginning to think in ragtime.

She was telling her number to the doorkeeper of the locker room as the

slap of the hospital door ceased to vibrate through the long corridor

on the eighth story.
The locker room had countless rows of narrow cells with iron gratings

for doors; and the gimlet gaze of two stalwart young females pierced

each newcomer. It was their business to see that Peter Rolls's hands

did not pilfer each other's belongings. The gimlet eyes must note the

outdoor clothing each girl wore on arrival, in order to be sure that

she did not go forth at evening clad in the property of a comrade.

Being paid to cultivate suspicion had soured the guardian angels'

tempers. One had a novel by Laura Jean Libbey, the other an

old-fashioned tale by Mary J. Holmes, to while away odd minutes of

leisure; but it appealed to the imagination of neither that any or all

of the girls flitting in and out might be eligible heroines for their

favourite authors, stolen at birth from parent millionaires,

qualifying through pathetic struggles with poverty to become the

brides of other millionaires, or, perhaps, to win an earl or duke.
All the regularly engaged hands had long ago shut up their hats and

cloaks in prison and gone about their business. It was only the extras

who were arriving at this late hour to show their numbers and claim

their lockers. There were comparatively few amateurs. Most of the

girls had had shop experience, but greenhorns betrayed ignorance as

they entered. To them, shortly and succinctly, were explained the

rules: the system of "stubs" dealt out to newcomers as they gave their

numbers and had lockers assigned them—stubs to be religiously kept

for the protection of property from false claimants; the working of a

slot machine, in which must be slipped a card, and the moment of the

morning and midday arrival thus recorded with ruthless exactitude

(twenty-five cents docked off your pay if you were late), and other

odds and ends of routine information, such as the hours at which

lockers might or might not be opened without the presentation of

special passes.
As Win fitted her key into the grated door which would in future

pertain to No. 2884, into the locker room bounced the sardine.
"Hello, Lady Ermyntrude!" said she. "I thought I'd pick you up some

place. Just a jiffy, and we can skip to the schoolroom together, if

your ladyship pleases."
"I am glad!" said Win, and as they went out side by side she ventured

to add: "Please do tell me why you call me Lady Ermyntrude. I hope I'm

not like anything so awful as that?"
"Oh, there's always a Lady Ermyntrude in every English book you read,

and you look as if you'd walked out of one. I don't know why, but you

do. I kind of like you, though."
"So do I you," said Win, but did not tell her that she was a sardine.

This might be a worse epithet in a foreign language even than Lady

Ermyntrude.
"I'm for the toy department. What are you?" rapped out the clear

little voice that matched the clear little personality—a personality

which, at the top of its pompadour, did not reach the tip of Win's

ear.
"Mine is called a two-hour bargain sale––"
"Heaven help you! Basement?"
"No, ground floor."
"Thank your stars. That's a cut above. Most amatoors start in the

basement bargain sales. If they live through the first day of

that—well! But you're all right. You've got the look of the ones

who win."
"That's my name—'Win'—Winifred Child."
"If you ain't the Champion Giant Kid! I'm Sadie Kirk. Here's the

schoolroom. When it ain't that, it calls itself the rest room, you

know. I'm here only because there's a little difference in Rolls's

check system from Bimgel's, where I worked till the grippe laid me low

and my place was filled. I thought I'd try the Hands for a change,

though they say it's the limit and down the other side. So me for

the school! We'll sit together, and if I can help you I will."
"You're a dear," whispered Win.
"You're another. Go there yourself," was the swift retort.
The rest room was really very nice, if there were ever a chance to

rest in it—which, Miss Kirk whispered, was not likely to be the case.

There were wall bookcases with glass doors, a few oak-framed

engravings with a pale-green, "distempered" background, several

chintz-covered sofas with cushions, and plenty of easy chairs.
On small tables lay very back numbers of illustrated papers and

magazines. The high windows had green curtains which softened their

glare and (said Sadie) prevented dust from showing. The brown-painted

floor had decorative intervals of rugs, like flowery oases. Altogether

the room would have been an excellent "show place" if any influential

millionairess began stirring up public interest in "conditions of

shop-girl life."
One end wall of the long, narrow room was almost entirely covered by

an immense blackboard, supposed to represent a check book. In front of

this stood a pale young man with a timid air, who coughed and cleared

his throat a good deal as he explained to a group of girls Peter

Rolls's specially simplified, modernly improved system of adding up

the prices of purchased "goods" in the quickest and most scientific

manner. Win listened intently, easily catching the idea, but wondering

if she should get "rattled" when she had to put it into practice in

the coming "two-hour bargain sale." Miss Kirk, however, soon saw that

the difference between this and other systems was not complicated

enough to trouble her, and let her wits wander from one subject to

another.
"That's a salesman teaching," she whispered up to her tall protégée.

"He's new to the job, I guess, and scared of us guyls; but I bet he

bullies men when he gets the chance! He'll tuyn out another Father."
Win, not having forgotten her curiosity concerning the red-haired

girl's mysterious murmur to the superintendent, longed to question the

sardine, who had the air of knowing everything she ought and ought not

to know. But the newcomer could not afford to lose a word that dropped

from the nervous teacher's lips. "Do tell me about it later," she

pleaded. "I must listen to this."
"All right. Are you lunching in or out?"
"Oh, in, I suppose."
"So will I, then, though I hear it's filthy and the grub vile. We'll

try and make a date."
Win dared not answer. With difficulty she caught the last part of the

lecture. Then her fifteen minutes of schooling were over and the real

battle of life as one of Peter Rolls's hands was to begin.
No time for the luxury of luncheon appointments. The two girls must

meet or not, as luck ordained. The toy department was on the sixth

floor, so the parting came almost at once, and Win went down to meet

her fate alone.
A floorwalker, or "aisle manager," showed her the place where the

"great two-hour bargain sale of coloured blouses, sashes, and ladies'

fancy neckwear" was advertised to begin at ten-thirty. As he steered

the girl through the crowd he looked at her with interest, and she

would have looked with interest at him could she have done so without

his knowing it. She had vaguely heard that shopwalkers in England

could make or break the salespeople. Probably floorwalkers in America

were the same, or more powerful, because everybody in this free

country who had any power at all seemed to have more than he could

possibly have anywhere else.
This man was extremely handsome she saw in the one quick, veiled

glance which can tell a girl as much as a boy is able to take in with

a long stare. He was tall and dark and clean shaven, with polished

black hair like a jet helmet, and brown eyes. Few princes could hope

to be as well dressed, and if he had been an actor, only to see his

shoulders would have made a matinée girl long to lay her head upon

one. Why wasn't he an actor, then, at many dollars a week, instead

of a floorwalker at a few? It must be that his fairy godmother had

forgotten to endow him with some essential talent.
Seeing that he looked at her sympathetically with his rather sad, dark

eyes, Win ventured with all respect to beg a little enlightenment as

to a two-hour bargain sale.
"It means that certain things are marked down for two hours," he

explained, "and after that anything left of the lot goes up to the old

price again. It's a pretty hard test for one who's new to the whole

business. The superintendent, Mr. Meggison, has put you on to a pretty

stiff thing," he added. And then again, after an instant's pause:

"You're going to land in a wasps' nest over there. There's some

electricity in the atmosphere this morning. But keep your head and

you'll be all right."
They came within sight of a hollow square formed by four long

counters. Above it was a placard with red and black lettering which

announced the sale to begin at half-past ten; everything to be sold at

bargain price till twelve-thirty. Within were six saleswomen, two for

each side of the square; and the question flashed through Win's head:

Why had she been imported to make an odd number? It was an exciting

question, taken in connection with the floorwalker's warning.
Until sale time these counters were out of the congested region; and

the six saleswomen were taking advantage of the lull before the storm

to put finishing touches on the arrangement of the stock. The instant

that Win was inside the square it was as if she had been suddenly

swallowed up in a thunder cloud. The head saleswoman (she must be

that, Win thought, judging from the attention paid her by the rest)

was in a black rage—a beautiful Jewess, older than the others, and

growing overplump, but magnificently browed, and hardly thirty yet.
"It's damnable!" she panted, full breast heaving, throat swelling with

stifled sobs, "to put this onto me! Anybody with half an eye can see

through the trick. The Queen of England couldn't get rid of these

nasty rags at a charity bazaar."
She went on without noticing the newcomer, except to flash across

Win's face and figure a lightning, Judith glance which seemed to pitch

a creature unknown and unwanted into the bottomless pit where all was

vile. Her satin-smooth olive hands, with brilliantly polished coral

nails, trembled as, gesticulating, she waved them over the stock which

littered the four counters. She seemed to be throwing her curse upon

blouses, sashes, and ladies' neckwear; and had she been a witch, with

power of casting spells, the masses of silk and satin would have burst

into coloured flame.
"Oh, Miss Stein, don't feel that way about it," pleaded a thin girl

who looked utterly bloodless. "The things are marked down so low maybe

they'll go off."
"Look at them—look at them!" broke out the Jewess. "Is there

anything you'd take for a present, one of you? They might as well have

sent me to the basement and be done with it. But I'll show him, and

her, too, how much I care before the day's out."
So fierce was the splendid creature's emotion that Win felt the hot

contagion of it. What had happened she did not know, though evidently

the others did and sympathized, or pretended to. But even she, a

stranger, could spring at a conclusion.
Miss Stein was called upon to sell things which she thought no

customers would buy. Somebody in power had put her in this position,

out of spite, to get her into trouble. There was another woman in the

case. There must be jealousy. This tigerish Judith was suffering as

keenly as a human creature could suffer, and all because of some

blouses, some sashes, and ladies' fancy neckwear, which certainly had

an unattractive appearance as they lay on the counters in confused

heaps.
"He says, 'it's up to you, Miss Stein!'" the quivering voice jerked

out in bitter mimicry. "Up to me, indeed! And he gives me this rag

bag!"
"It'll be nuts to her if you're downed," remarked a girl with a

round, pink face.
"Don't you think I know it?" Miss Stein demanded fiercely. Her eyes

filled with tears, which she angrily dried with a very dirty

handkerchief that looked strangely out of keeping in the manicured

hands. "There's nothing to do, or I'd do it, except to give him a

piece of my mind and throw up the job before they have the chance to

fire me."
"You wouldn't—just at this time!" cried the anemic girl.
"Wouldn't I? You'll see. I don't care a tinker's curse what becomes of

me after to-day."
Win's ears were burning as if they had been tweaked. The minutes were

passing. She could ask no help, no information concerning her duties.

If she put a question as to what she was to do she would be snubbed,

or worse. Could the far-away and almost omnipotent Mr. Meggison have

had secret knowledge of this lion's den into which he had thrown her?

He had said the bargain square and the two-hours' sale would be a test

of character. At this rate, she would fail ignominiously, and she did

not want to fail. But neither did she want the beautiful Jewess to

fail. Her anxiety was not all selfish. "A test of character!" Was

there nothing, nothing she could do for her own and the general

good?
Suddenly her spirit flew back to the ship. Peter Rolls's face came

before her. She saw his good blue eyes. She heard him say: "If ever I

can help––"
How odd! Why should she have thought of him then? And no one could

help, least of all he, who had probably forgotten all about her by

this time, Miss Rolls having spoiled his horrid, deceitful game. She

must help herself Yet it was just as if Peter had come and suggested

an idea—really quite a good idea, if only she had the courage to

interrupt Miss Stein.
She and Peter had chatted one night on B deck about the Russian

dancers and Leon Bakst's designs. She had lectured Peter on the

amazing beauty of strangely combined colours, mixtures which would not

have been tolerated before the "Russian craze." Now Peter seemed to be

reminding her of what she had said then, a silly little boast she had

made, that with "nothing but a few rags and a Bakst inspiration" she

could put together a gorgeous costume for a fancy-dress ball.
"When you want to set up for a rival to Nadine, I'll back you," Peter

had retorted, and they had both laughed.
Now, with the immense but impersonal "backing" of Peter Rolls, Sr.'s,

great shop, she had the Bakst inspiration and the tingling ambition to

set up (in a very small way) as a rival to Nadine.
"I beg your pardon," she stammered to Miss Stein, and hastened on as a

fierce, astonished look was fastened upon her from under a black cloud

of stormy brow. "I—I hope you'll excuse my interrupting, but I've

been a model of Nadine's, and—and I have an idea, if you'll allow

me—I mean, you don't seem to like these things we have to sell. I

believe we could make something of them if we hurried."
All through she had the feeling that if she could not hold Miss

Stein's eyes until she had compelled interest, hope was lost. She put

her whole self into the effort to hold the eyes, and she held them,

talking fast, pouring the magnetic force of her enthusiasm into the

angry, unhappy soul of the other.
"What do you mean?" asked Miss Stein, abruptly taking the sharp,

judicial air of the business woman. Half resentful, half contemptuous,

she could not afford to let slip the shadow of a chance.
"I'll show you, if I may," said Win.
She, the outsider, the intruder, suddenly dominated the situation. The

others, even Miss Stein herself, gave way before the Effect in black

as it came close to one of the counters and with quick, decided

touches began manipulating those blouses, sashes, and ladies' fancy

neckwear which the Queen of England could not sell at a charity

bazaar.
A box of steel pins of assorted sizes lay on a cleared corner of the

counter which Win had approached. It had been brought, perhaps, for

the pinning of labels onto the newly repriced stock. Win took a purple

sash and draped it round the waistline of a dull-looking, sky-blue

blouse. Quickly the draping was coaxed into shape and firmly held with

pins. Then under the collar was fastened a crimson bow ("ladies' fancy

neckwear!") which had been hideous in itself, but suddenly became

beautiful as a butterfly alighting on a flower.
"My!" exclaimed the anemic girl, and glanced cautiously from under her

eyelids to see whether approval or disgust were the popular line to

take.
But Miss Stein—still resentful, and now beginning to be jealous of a

green hand's originality and daring taste—was not an Oriental for

nothing. She didn't possess the initiative ability of a designer, but

she could appreciate the crashing music of gorgeous colours met

together on the right notes. Love of colour was in her Jewish blood,

and she was a shrewd business woman also, animated with too vital a

selfishness to let any opportunity of advancement go. She seized the

new girl's idea at a glance, realized its value and its possible

meaning for herself.
"That's queer, but it's smart," she pronounced, and five anxious faces

brightened. "I'd 'a' thought o' that if I hadn't been so awful

worried; my head feels stuffed full o' wadding. I don't seem to have

room for two ideas. Me and you can tell the guyls what to do, and

they'll do it. See here, as fast as we get those things fixed we'll

hang 'em up on the line and make a show. Gee! they'll draw the dames a

mile off, just out of curiosity and nothing else."
"And when we get them we'll get their money, too," Win prophesied

cheerfully. "We'll christen these things Pavlova Russian Sash-Blouses,

and say it's the latest dodge only to pin them together so

purchasers can change the drapery to fit their figures. When we've

sold all we can finish before ten-thirty we'll make a point of pinning

on drapery and neckties in the customers' presence to suit their

taste. I can undertake that part, if you like."
"You do think you're some girl, don't you?" was Miss Stein's only

comment. But Win saw that she meant to accept the scheme and "work it

for all it was worth."
A light of hope and the excitement of battle shone down the dull flame

of anger in her eyes. There was no gleam of gratitude there, and if

Win had wanted it she would have been disappointed; but just at this

moment she wanted nothing on earth save to push that beautiful Jewess

to a triumph over "him and her" and to make the two-hour sale of

Pavlova Russian Sash-Blouses a frantic, furious success.
 
 
CHAPTER X
PETER ROLLS'S LITTLE WAYS
Something strange had happened in the ground-floor bargain square. The

wasps' nest had suddenly turned into a beehive. The buzz of rage had

lulled to the hum of industry. Fred Thorpe, the "aisle manager," was

blessed with the tact which only some secret sympathy or great natural

kindness can put into a man; and it had kept him at a distance from

Miss Stein that morning. He knew the inner history of that particular

bargain sale, and there were reasons why he should understand with

peculiar acuteness the humiliation she had been doomed to endure. His

presence on the scene would make matters worse, and he had obliterated

himself as much as possible.
Nevertheless he saw all that went on in that direction, and the sudden

and remarkable change which took place immediately after the tall

English girl's arrival amazed him. He did not know what to make of it,

but it was so evidently a change for the better, and the time before

the sale was so short, that he decided to sink conventions and let the

saleswomen alone.
The floorwalker had plenty of other things to keep him busy, but his

subself eyed the strenuous, mysterious preparations for the coming

two-hour sale of blouses, sashes, and ladies' fancy neckwear. Five

minutes ago the unfortunate stock (which finished the latest chapter

of Stein-Horrocks-Westlake-Thorpe inner history) had laid in neglected

heaps on the four counters which walled in the hollow square. Miss

Stein and her five companions had confined their energies to examining

labels, and that in a perfunctory manner, a mere cloak for feverish

whisperings. The sale was doomed to failure—had been doomed from the

moment that Mr. Horrocks, the manager of the department (who was also

a sub-buyer), had "dumped" a disastrous purchase from a bankrupt sale

onto the girl whom every one knew he had jilted for Miss Westlake.

There was far more in it than that; an intricate intrigue of shop

life. But so much at least was common property in the department; and

the elevation of Miss Westlake, the humiliation of Miss Stein, could

be seen by all, for Miss Westlake close by was selling the most

entrancing new fichus which had begun the day with a succès fou.
No use advising Miss Stein to buck up and do her best. Anything Fred

Thorpe could say on the subject would be bitterly misconstrued. He

realized that her conception of the part to play was to make the worst

of things instead of the best and snatch what satisfaction she could

from a flare-up. That was what Horrocks wanted, of course, but she was

past caring, or so it seemed until the sudden change took place after

the appearance of the new girl.
Soon Thorpe began to understand the scheme. With an eye for colour and

a swiftness of touch that was almost incredible, unsympathetic blouses

were changed into daring yet dainty "confections." As fast as the

girls finished draping the sashes and pinning on fantastically

knotted ties of contrasted colours, they hung up the most attractive

of their creations on lines above the counters which had been meagrely

furnished forth with a few stringy, fringed sashes. While some girls

worked like demons in transforming "stock," others arranged it on the

lines and counters. Complete "Pavlovas" only were displayed in

prominent places. Such things as could not be ready in time for the

sale opening were grouped as prettily as possible, according to colour

schemes, on the two less conspicuous of the four counters—those which

faced away from the more frequently occupied avenues of approach.
This was doubtless Miss Stein's experienced contribution to the plan

of battle; but, clever saleswoman as she was, when brain and heart

were cool, Thorpe realized that all credit for originating the scheme

should be given to the new girl. "She's a live wire," he said to

himself, though his deepest sympathies were for Miss Stein. And he saw

the "smartness" of Mr. Meggison in "spotting" No. 2884 for this place.
Meggison was, of course, "onto" the situation, for the whole secret of

the man's sudden rise lay in his capacity for knowing and keeping

track of every current and undercurrent of life in each department.

With Miss Stein at their head, her five assistants would not put the

energy of one into disposing of the hated stock, therefore Meggison

had sent an "extra." He had chosen a new girl because she would not

"take sides," and a girl who looked as if she might hold her own

against odds, because she would need all her "ginger" if she were to

"make good." Besides Thorpe said to himself, Meggison might have his

eye upon her, perhaps, as something out of the common run of extras

merely hired for the holidays and intend to test her.
Somehow all the department managers and floorwalkers and head salesmen

smiled dryly when they thought of Meggison (who had lately been

promoted) in connection with any girl. They seldom put into words what

lay behind the smile, for you never knew who might be a spy—a "sneak"

or a "quiz." But all the men knew his one laughable weakness, and

would rather get hold of a "sample" of it than be treated to a

champagne dinner at the Waldorf.
Long before half-past ten women who wanted blouses and had seen the

newspaper advertisements of the two-hour bargain sale began to inquire

where it would be held. Thorpe was constantly obliged to direct them,

and watching them group where they could see the decorations of the

square, his ears were sharpened for comments.
The quick minds of American women soon caught the idea which the

colour arrangement conveyed. "Why, it's like the things the Russian

dancers wear!" said one.
"It's the newest trick I've seen yet," said another.
Thorpe could not help thinking of the difference between these

exclamations and those he had expected to hear when the advertised

blouses first burst on the beholders eyes.
At ten-thirty to the second the waiting women pounced. Win's nerve

failed her for an instant in the hot forefront of her first battle,

but she caught at Miss Kirk's remembered words: "You've got the look

of those who win," and the floorwalker's advice: "Keep your head and

you'll be all right." She mustn't be a coward. She mustn't fall at

her first shot.
Soon she realized that she need expect no help from Miss Stein or the

five satellites who took their cue from her. The Russian inspiration

had happened to be acceptable but she was to be shown that she mustn't

take advantage of her start. The question or two she began to ask had

for an answer: "Good Lord, don't bother me!" "If you can't see for

yourself, what are your eyes for?" or "This ain't the schoolroom, I

don't think!"
Maybe, she told herself, the girls were not always like this. To-day

they were desperate, and no wonder. She mustn't mind a few snubs. They

hardly knew what they were saying. The check book was more formidable

than it had seemed on the blackboard, and she envied the others their

quick, almost mechanical way of adding and subtracting. Would she ever

be like that? Meanwhile the thing was to keep the entries in her check

book correct.
She was saved, perhaps, by the need which soon arose for one girl to

put in shape for customers the blouses, sashes, and ties which had not

been pinned together. Just as her brain began to reel over a difficult

calculation which must be made in a clamouring hurry, Miss Stein

commanded a change of work.
"As soon as you're through with this customer," was the order.
Win took time to draw breath and finished the sum correctly "I should

have gone flump over the next!" she thought, with a thankful sigh, for

she was in her element, choosing colours and draping sashes to suit

customers' "styles." Miss Stein grudged her the distinction, but

granted it for the sake of business. If the girl showed signs of

"uppishness" when the sale was over she should soon be made to see

that it wouldn't pay.
Even as it was, Win used up one whole check book, containing fifty

order forms, and also her own vitality. She had no time to realize how

tired she was until half-past twelve brought the sale to an end. Even

then a thing that happened pushed away thought of self for a few more

moments.
Walking beside Mr. Thorpe, the aisle manager, came a big,

auburn-haired, red-moustached man of thirty three or four, with a

particularly pleasant, smiling face of florid colour and excitable

blue eyes. He looked boyishly obstinate, and yet, Win thought, as if

he might be easy to "get round," unless some prejudice kept him firm.

She would not have thought of him at all had not the flush which

suddenly swept over Miss Stein's face suggested that this was "he."
Win was instantly sure that here was the man in the case; now,

cherchez la femme! And she had not to search far.
The two men did not come to the bargain square, but he of the red

moustache slowed down to throw a glance of intense interest at the

denuded counters and the customers who lingered, though the sale was

ended, to buy "Pavlovas" at their suddenly augmented price. He spoke

to the floorwalker, and got some answer which Miss Stein would

evidently have given at least a week out of her life to hear. Then the

pair passed on, but only to pause again plainly—too plainly—in sight

of all eyes in the hollow square.
The red-moustached man parted company with his companion and went

straight to a counter where lace scarfs and fichus and wonderful

boudoir caps were achieving a brilliant success. Instantly a

fairy-like brunette with cherry lips and a bewitching, turned-up nose

came forward with a sweet meekness that was the subtlest kind of

coquetry. Whatever he had to say was said in a second or two, and the

girl answered as quickly. But she went back to work with a conscious

look which would to any watching woman announce that she considered

the man her property.
"Little pig!" Win said to herself. "She's purring with joy because

Miss Stein saw. (Do pigs purr?) Anyhow I am glad we've made a

success. That must be some comfort! Why, at the Hands it's like a big

theatre with a lot of different stages, where the curtains go up

unexpectedly and give you a glimpse of an act."
But exciting as the plays were, the one in which she herself had a

part began to seem very long drawn out when the first wild rush of the

two-hour act was over. Miss Stein, without a word of appreciation to

the new recruit who had saved the day, went off with the anemic girl

to lunch. Two others left at the same time, and only a couple of the

old guard remained to hold the fort with Win. Three were quite enough,

however, to cope with the diminished trade. Customers, as well as

saleswomen, were thinking of food; and as the crowd in the shopping

centres of the great store thinned perceptibly, no doubt it thickened

to the darkening of the air in the famous Pompeian restaurant on the

top floor.
Most of the best "confections" in the hollow square were sold, and

Win was aware, as interest slackened, that she felt "rather like a

hollow square" herself.
There was a little "flap" chair turned up against each of the four

counters, and at ebb-tide of custom Win looked at them wistfully.
"I suppose we're allowed to sit down for a minute when there's nothing

to do?" she inquired of a plump, dull-eyed girl who was furtively

polishing the nails of one hand with the ball of her other palm.
"We're legally allowed to, if that's what you mean," replied the

other. "But we're not encouraged to. I wouldn't, my first day,

anyways, if I was you."
"Thank you very much," said Winifred. "It's good of you to tell me

things. I won't sit down, since you advise me not. But it is hard,

standing up so long, especially after such a rush as we've had, isn't

it?"
"Oh, if you think this is hard!" echoed the plump girl, Miss Jones.

(Win noticed that the saleswomen called each other by name, though

officially they were numbers.) "You ain't bin three hours yet. Wait

and see how you feel to-night when ten o'clock comes."
"Ten o'clock!" gasped Win. "I thought we closed at six."
"We're supposed to shut up then, but folks won't go these busy weeks.

They can't be chased out. And we have to stay hours after they

have gone, putting away stock and—oh, shucks of things. Little do

the swell dames care what happens to us once they're outside the

doors. I guess they think we cease to exist the minute they don't need

us to wait on them."
"I've always heard that rich American women took such an interest in

the working—I mean, in us, who work," Win hastily amended.
"Oh, when they're old or sick of their diamonds and their automobiles

they think it'll be some spree to come and stir us guyls up to strike

against our wrongs. But when we've struck it's just about their time

for getting sick of us. I got caught that way once when I worked in a

candy-box factory. I bet I don't again! See here, I'm kind of sorry

for you if you thought the Hands was a party where they asked you to

sit down and have afternoon tea. Fred Thorpe, the floorwalker in this

depart, is a real good feller, and he'd be glad to give us a rest—a

big difference between him and some I've knowed! But he dasn't treat

us as white as he'd like. In this show every Jack and Jill is

watched from above. There ain't nobody except Father himself das' call

his soul his own. If a chap thinks he's safe to do some tiny thing his

own way, gee! a brick falls smack on his head. That's one of Peter

Rolls's little ways."
Win shivered slightly to hear that name thus used, but Miss Jones was

absorbed in her subject.
"Us guyls ain't even supposed to talk to each other, except about

business," she went on. "But that's just the one thing they can't

stop, and they know they can't, so they have to wink at it. You see,

though, the way I keep folding the goods or pretending to look for

something every instant, so you'd most think I'd got the St. Vitus's

dance? Well, that's because if we just stood with our heads together

poor Thorpe would have to come careering over here and inquire what

was the subject of our earnest conversation. He'd hate it like poison,

but he'd do it all the same, or the feller above would know the

reason why."
"I thought he seemed kind and nice—I mean Mr. Thorpe," said Win.
"No use trying to mash him! He's gone on Dora Stein. Say, did you get

on to the sale job? I somehow thought you did."
"I saw there was some trouble," Win hesitated.
"Trouble? There's nothing but trouble. Anybody'd think we was asking

for it! This blessed depart is upset from way back since the

promotions began. Our last superintendent got the sack through his

drunken wife coming around the place makin' scenes. And Mr. Meggison

was put over another man's head. That made t'other feller so mad he

blowed out his brains. 'Twas in the papers, but it got hushed up

mighty quick. The news, not the brains, I mean! Old Saint Peter knows

some tricks of hushin' up.
"Well, anyways, that set the ball rolling, and our head salesman was

jumped up to be department manager and buyer right over Thorpe's head.

'Twas too much for him, and he gave Dora Stein the toss. Now he wants

her out of his shine, and he dumped some jay stuff he bought in a

bankrupt sale on her to get rid of. The head buyer give him beans for

bein' fooled over a snide lot of trash like that, so what he does is

to visit it on us. He hoped Dora'd get mad and clear out so he

wouldn't see her eyes on him every time he walked past to give Miss

Westlake, his new guyl, the glad eye. But I guess now Miss Stein's

made such a big success where he hoped she'd fail, she'll stay pat."
As Miss Jones finished her story she watched Win's face to see if it

changed, but there was no sign that the newcomer grudged Miss Stein

the credit. She was actually smiling.
"There's something queer about that girl," Miss Jones presently

murmured to Miss McGrath at the other end of the square, as Win was

called upon to serve a lady who had been told at luncheon about the

Pavlovas. "She ain't natural. What'll you bet she's a spy? I'm goin'

to ask Miss Stein what she thinks."
 
 
CHAPTER XI
DEVIL TAKE THE HINDMOST
Miss Kirk was almost ready to go from the restaurant to work again

when Win appeared, a three-cent entrance ticket in her hand, to face

an atmosphere crowded with sundry uncongenial members of the vegetable

kingdom.
"Hello, 2884 England!" Sadie feigned facetiously to call her up by

telephone. "Got yer number, all right, you see! I begun to think

they'd rung me off, so I wouldn't get onto you again this side heaven.

And say, that reminds me: heaven looks a long way from here, don't

it?"
Win smiled.
"Good thing! You ain't got yer smile rubbed off yet. Stick to it if

y'can. It's a fine prop. I otta go in a minute, but you're such a

chicken if I don't watch out for you y'might get lost in the wash. Any

one put you wise on that three-cent billy doo?"
"The girl at the door told me I was to buy it of her," said Win, "and

then I could divide it up for three different things to eat. But can

one get three different things to eat for three cents? It seems

wonderful!"
"You won't be so much surprised when you've got 'em et. I'd try a

soup, a mutton sandwich, and a cuppa cawfee for eight cents, if I

was you. But see here, I ain't goin' to feed my face in this ranch

after to-day. I knowed pretty near how punk 'twould be from things

guyls told me about the Hands, and I only took a meal so as to see you

and ask how the Giant Child was gettin' along. No more o' this grub

for mine! And if I was in your place I'd go out to eat. You get a

breath o' fresh air; and a cuppa hot chocolate for a nickel at a drug

store, with a free lunch o' crackers thrown in, 'll do you a sight

more good than the best there is in this dope shop."
Long before Miss Kirk had finished pouring out advice, the eight-cent

lunch of soup, sandwich, and coffee had been slapped down on a dirty

tablecloth by a frantic rabbit of a waitress. The big restaurant was

dim, even at midday, because its only windows gave upon a narrow court

which separated that part of the building from another part of equal

height. It was so dark that perhaps the hard-worked females who

cleaned it might be excused for passing blemishes sunlight would have

thrown into their faces.
One did not exactly see the dirt (except on the cheap, unbleached

"damask" flung crookedly over the black oilcloth nailed onto table

tops); but, like a cowardly ghost that dares not show itself, in some

secret, shuddering way the squalor was able to make its presence felt.

Now and then a black beetle pottered across the oilcloth-covered

floor; and though a black beetle may happen anywhere, it potters only

where it feels at home, otherwise it scurries about in desperate

apology for living. The soup was cold and greasy and tasted of an

unscoured pot. The mutton sandwich, as Sadie remarked, would have been

better suited to the antique department; and the coffee, though hot,

might as easily have been tea or cocoa, or a blend of all three.
"What a shame to feed their people like this!" exclaimed Win, who had

thought she was hungry, but now found herself mistaken. And again the

eyes of Peter Rolls, Jr., seemed to be looking straight into hers. No

wonder he was what his sister hinted at if he knew all about this and

had not the heart to care! And if he didn't trouble to know, it was

just as bad.
"They don't want to feed us, you see," said Sadie, slowly finishing a

baked apple which looked like a head-hunter's withered trophy. "On the

low prices they're obliged to charge they can't make a cent offen us.

Besides if all the guyls et in the house they'd have to give up more

of their valuable room. They'd rather we'd go out, so long as we're

back in time. Only the poorest ones, who have to look twice at every

cent, feed in the restaurant as a reg'lar thing; or the weak ones,

who're so dead tired they can't bear to take a nextra step. And oh, by

the way, talkin' o' that, you'll need foot powder. Your first week

your feet'll hurt that bad you'll be ready to bawl. But if you can

stand it and your back bein' broke in two at the waist it'll be better

the week after, and so on, till you won't notice so much. Now I must

go or I'll be docked, and I ain't the betrothed of a millionaire yet.

But tell me where you live. Me and you might see something of e'

juther, if you feel the way I do."
"I liked you the minute I looked round the corner of my shoulder and

saw you plastered onto my back!" laughed Win, already revived, not by

the food, but by some subtle emanation of strength and sympathy from

the more experienced girl. "I wish I could live near you. The

boarding-house where I am is too expensive, and I've given notice to

leave on Saturday."
"My! You'd turn up your nose at Columbus Avenue, I guess," said Miss

Kirk. "That's where I hang out. It ain't a boardin'-house. What's the

use shellin' out for meals and not bein' home to them? I'd like awful

well to have you in the same movie with me. There ain't a guyl I care

to speak to on the film! But the 'L' runs past the place, and some

folks say it otta be spelled with 'H.' The noise pretty near drove me

bughouse at fyst, but I'm settlin' down to it now. And oh, say, that

big feller whose best lion died on him (good thing 'twasn't his best

guyl!) he told me he's come to Columbus to room with the chum w'at put

him onto wuykin for the Hands. He's in the toy department with me and

feels real at home with the Teddy bears. I could get you a room in my

house for two dollars per."
"Per what?" Win was obliged to ask.
"Per week. Per everything. And if you take my tips about grub, and do

your own waists and hank'chiffs Sundays—laundry 'em, I mean, instead

of wallerin' in bed like a sassiety bud, you'll have money to burn or

put in the mishrunny box."
"I'll come!" exclaimed Win. "Please engage the room. If it's good

enough for you, it's good enough for me, and I'll put up with the

noise for the sake of your society."
"My! Thanks for the bookays and choclits! Ta, ta! I'll wait for you

to-night at the stage entrance with the other Johnnies."
She was off with the promptness of a soubrette after an "exit

speech," and Win was left to sip her stale coffee or spend what

remained of her "off time" in the rest room next door.
Legally, Peter Rolls was supposed to give his hands an hour for the

midday meal, but in the rush of the holiday season a way had been

found for whipping the inconvenient little law devil round the post.

Employees were asked to "lend" the management half of the legally

allotted hour, the time to be repaid them later, so that after

Christmas they might take once a week an hour and a half in the middle

of the day instead of an hour. Those in the know had learned that, as

on Christmas Eve most of the extra hands received with their pay

envelope a week's notice to quit, they, at least, never got back the

half-hours lent. As for the permanent hands, it would amount to a

black mark secretly put against their names if they dared lay claim to

the time owing. Win, however, was blissfully ignorant of this, and

though she was tired, the arrangement seemed fair to her. As she got

up from the table to spend fifteen minutes in the rest room she was

almost happy in the thought of having the sardine for a neighbour.
Two of the girls who had come up from the bargain square with her, on

the return of Miss Stein and their other seniors, looked after Win as

she passed out of the restaurant.
"There goes Miss Thank-you-I-beg-your-pardon," said the young lady who

had wondered if 2884 were a spy. "She's got a smile as if she was

invited to tea with the Vanderbilts."
"By this time next week I bet she smiles the wrong side of her mouth

if she puts on any airs with Dora Stein."
"Hum-m, yeh. Unless what you think's so, and she's on the right side

o' Father."
It was true, as the girls had warned the new hand, when six

o'clock—closing time—came, you "couldn't chase the dames out." The

salespeople began to put things away, and some even ventured to remind

customers that the shop shut at six; but ladies who believed

themselves possessed of the kindest hearts on earth pleaded that they

must have one more thing, only just one, to complete their list

for that day. Those who were too cross and tired to think about hearts

or anything else except their own nerves, made no excuses at all, but

demanded what they wanted or threatened a report to the floorwalker if

a saleswoman were "disagreeable."
"Look at them!" snapped Miss Stein, maddened by a consignment of more

blouses from the bankrupt sale (which had brought upon Horrocks the

gibes of the head buyer), blouses without sashes, which not even

Poiret could have turned into "Pavlovas." "Look at them, the fat, old,

self-satisfied lemons, with their hats and their dresses and their

squeezed-in corsets and shoes, and even their back hair, bought in

sweat shops like ours! Pills, going to their homes to say their

prayers, and then, full o' dinner, to the meeting of the Anti-Sweats.

I know em! Maybe they'll do some o' the sweatin' in kingdom come!"
Already Win had learned that a "lemon" or a "pill" was a customer who

made as much trouble as possible for as small as possible a return;

but it gave her a stab to hear Peter Rolls's great department store

called a "sweat shop." Again she saw the eyes. Was she never to get

rid of the memory of those hypocritical blue eyes?
Nobody thought of being ready for home until nearly ten o'clock; and

long before that Miss Stein's nerves felt as if they had been run,

like threads, through the eyes of hot needles. Again Win had helped

her in the afternoon by placing blouses of congenial colours together

on the counters instead of letting them lie anyhow, as Miss Stein, in

her recklessness, would have done. But less than ever had the elder

girl seen reason for thanking Miss Child when the second instalment of

"punk" goods was brought out of "reserve."
If the first lot had not gone off so soon they would not have been

saddled with this, and so 2884 had, in Miss Stein's estimation, done

nothing at the end of the day except "show herself off" and make

everybody work twice as hard as necessary. She would not tell Win how

to put things away, or let anybody else help her out.
"You gotta learn for yourself or you never will," she said sharply,

all the more sharply because Fred Thorpe, the floorwalker, happened to

be within earshot.
"I don't care what he thinks of me!" she said fiercely to herself,

knowing that Thorpe would understand and disapprove her injustice to

the new girl. But it was only half true that she did not care.
She was longing desperately for somebody to love her; and though she

could not in decency have accepted, after the way she had treated him,

she wished that Thorpe would ask her to have supper with him that

night. The Westlake pig, she knew, was going to Dorlon's for a pan

roast with Horrocks, for the creature had told all the girls who were

sure to run with it to her, Dora Stein. Thorpe would have been a faded

flag to flaunt in the face of the enemy—a floorwalker, to one who had

mashed a department manager! Still it would have been comforting to

know that she still had attractions for some one, and at least she

would have liked the chance to refuse an invitation.
Thorpe, on his part, would joyfully have asked her, for he could not

quite "unlove" the beautiful face he had once adored, though he knew

now exactly what a fierce spirit lived behind it. He was well aware of

his own weakness and was humble enough to confuse with it the kindness

of heart which permitted such treatment as he had received.
No girl, not even Dora Stein herself, would dare risk offending any

other of the floorwalkers, men able to break a saleswoman if they "got

a down" on her. But Dora knew only too well that he would not demean

himself to take revenge on her or any one. And probably she believed

that he would not punish or even "call her down" for injustice to a

newcomer.
Thorpe was miserable that night, for he had missed few incidents of

the day in Dora's neighbourhood. He recognized a "live wire" when he

saw one, and he did see that 2884 had "stuff" in her. She deserved to

be praised, and encouragement was all that she needed to turn her into

a valuable saleswoman, one who might become a "real winner" some day.

He could help her by speaking a few kind words, but Miss Stein would

think them spoken on purpose to spite her, and that wouldn't do 2884

much good if she stayed in the blouse department. Also he could help

her by mentioning in the right quarter her generalship in the matter

of the "Pavlovas" instead of letting Dora take the credit. But if he

did the girl any sort of justice he would be harming Miss Stein.
"I don't know what to do! I guess I shall have to leave the thing to

Providence—and the devil take the hindmost!" he thought gloomily.
It seemed to Win, as she went out at last, a week since she had come

in by the same door. It was like a play she had seen, where, in the

second act, the people who had been young in the first were

middle-aged when the curtain next rose; and in the third they were

old, all in the course of a few hours. But a year or two seemed to

drop from her shoulders when she caught sight of Miss Kirk waiting for

her in the street. Beside Miss Kirk, to the surprise of 2884, towered

the lion tamer.
"Well, I thought you'd never come!" was the greeting of Sadie. "But

all's well that ends well. And Mr. Teddy Lion here wants to take us

some place for a little supper."
"That ain't no way to interdooce me to the lady, kid," said the big

fellow. "She won't look my way if you treat me light like that. My

name's Earl Usher. Honest truth, 'tis, off the bills! Y'will come

along, won't you?"
"You're very kind," Win began in the conventional way that he had

laughed at in the morning. Then, afraid of being teased again, she

said that she must go home.
"I don't know what my landlady will think," she excused herself. "I

walked out early this morning, never dreaming I should be gone until

late at night."
"Well, she can't kill you," suggested Miss Kirk, "and, anyhow, you're

leavin' the end of the week. I think you'll be real mean if you won't

come. I know what your reason is, and so does he. He ain't nobody's

fool. Do you s'pose I'm the sort would do anything myself, or ask you

to do anything, that wasn't all right? We ain't in the Four Hundred,

nor yet in court circles, I don't think. And this ain't London nor

it ain't Boston. Thank Gawd it's little old N'York."
"But––" Win persisted, and stopped.
"I know what's got her goat," said Earl Usher. "It's that slush o'

mine this morning about not bein' a millionaire and my face needin' to

be fed. I thought afterward 'that's no talk for a gen'leman to use

before a lady.' Well, I may not be a millionaire at present, but I can

see my way to feedin' our t'ree faces and not feel the pinch."
"Ain't you the fresh guy?" exclaimed Miss Kirk. "Our faces are our

own, thank you just the same, and this is a Dutch treat. You might

'a' knowed we'd stick that close to ettiket. I can run to fifteen

cents, as far as I'm concerned How is it with you, Miss Child?"
"I can run to that, too," said Win.
"Same here," announced the big young man; "though I'd set my heart on

t'other kind o' treat. Where shall it be? I suppose we mustn't think

o' the Waldorf—what?"
"Huh!" snorted Miss Kirk, "not for mine, if I owned the mint! I bin to

the Waldorf wunst, of course. I went just out of curiosity to see how

the swells et. Wunst is enough, like goin' to the menagerie. Y'owe it

to yer intelligence to see all the different forms of animal life the

good Lord has created, behavin' accordin' to their kind, and then

come back to your own, thankin' Gawd you're not as they are. We'll eat

at Ginger Jim's, where we can lean our elbows on the tables and get

perfectly good oyster soup for ten cents a head!"
They walked for a while, Earl Usher insisting on the two girls taking

his arms, one on either side. By and by they got into a crosstown car,

and it was when Win was being helped out by the lion tamer that a

motor dashed past. The existence of people who went about in splendid

gray motor cars seemed to Win so far away from her own just then that,

standing in the street, her hand in Earl Usher's, she gazed into the

large, lighted window of the automobile as she might have gazed

through a powerful telescope at a scene of family life on Mars.
There were two girls in evening dress and two young men in the

illuminated chariot. It flashed by like a Leonid, but left a gay

impression of flower-tinted velvet cloaks and ermine and waved hair

with a glitter of diamonds and oval white shirtfronts and black coats.

Also a pair of eyes seemed to look for the twentieth part of a second

into Winifred's.
"I don't believe it was he!" she said to herself when the motor had

gone by.
 
 
CHAPTER XII
BLUE PETER
Peter Rolls, Sr., and Peter junior were both unhappy in vastly

different ways. One difference was that Peter junior knew he was

unhappy and suspected why. Peter senior had no idea that what he

suffered from was unhappiness. He thought that it was indigestion, and

he supposed that feeling as he felt was the normal state of men

passing beyond middle age. When you were growing old you could not

expect to keep much zest or personal interest in life or to enjoy

things, so he had always been told; and dully, resignedly, he believed

what "they" said.
If any one had told him that he was a miserable man he would have been

angry, and also surprised. Why the dickens should he be miserable? He

considered himself one of the most successful men in New York, and his

greatest pleasure was in recalling his successes, step by step, from

the time before he got his foot on the first rung of the ladder all

the way up to the top.
Often he lay awake at night pondering on those first days and first

ambitions. If he began to think of them when he went to bed it was

fatal. He became so pleasantly excited, and the past built itself up

so realistically all about him, that he could not go to sleep for

hours. What a sensational "bed book" is to some tired brains, that

was his past to the head of the Hands. Besides, he had everything in

the world that he or anybody else (it seemed to him) could possibly

want. Perhaps it was a little irritating when you could have all you

wanted not to know what to want. But, he consoled himself, that must

be so with all rich people. The best thing was not to think about it.
He was convinced that he loved mother as dearly as ever a husband had

loved a wife. They were uncomfortable together, but wretched apart.

That was marriage. There was nothing more in it.
They hadn't much to say to each other. But you never saw husbands and

wives chatting together like love birds after the honeymoon. You

wanted a bright-cheeked, laughing girl, and you got her. If you were

faithful to each other, and didn't have rows, it was an ideal match,

especially if there were children.
Peter Rolls was very fond of his children. When they were little they

had been the joy of his life; the thought of them had been the only

one that warmed his heart and gave him almost superhuman energy to

take the future by the horns like a bull and force a ring through its

bleeding nose that it might be ready for them to ride when they grew

up.
Now they were grown up, and they were riding; and it was natural that

the fire of the heart should have calmed. He was proud of the pair,

very proud. Pete (no, he mustn't call him by that name. Ena didn't

like it, said it sounded common) Peter—or Petro, if he preferred—was

a gentleman and made a good show for every dollar that had been spent

on him. Put him with an Astor or a Livingston and you couldn't tell

the difference!
Once, a long time ago, old Peter had dreamed of a young Peter

succeeding him in the business; but Ena had made him see what a

foolish dream that was—foolish and inconsistent, too—because, what

was the good of slaving to satisfy your ambition, and then, when you

reached the goal, instead of profiting by what you'd got, ordering

your heir down to the level you'd worked to leave behind?
Peter senior had entirely come round to Ena's view, and instead of

regretting that Peter junior hadn't in him the making of a hard-boiled

man of business who'll do anything to succeed, father stopped Peter

abruptly whenever he showed an inconvenient sign of interest in the

Hands and what went on under the glitter of their rings. Nor was

Peter's interest of the right kind. It was not what Peter senior

called practical.
Ena, now! There was a girl to be proud of. Father was so proud that

pride of his splendid daughter had frozen out or covered with ashes

the glow which used to fill his heart at the thought of her. But pride

was the right thing! That was what he had worked for: to make of his

children a man and woman to be proud of when the top stone was on his

pile.
Ena was more than a lady. She was an orchid, a princess. She ruled

father with her little finger—a beautifully manicured, rose-and-white

finger, such as he had hardly seen when he was young. There was so

much of himself in Ena that Peter yielded to her mandates as to the

inarticulate cry of his own soul translated into words. The princess

in whose veins his blood ran must understand what he ought to want

better than he himself could understand.
She said: What was the fun of having money if you couldn't know all

the best people everywhere, and be of them as well as merely among

them? She began saying this even before she came home "for good" from

school. It was a school for millionaires' daughters, and the daughters

of other millionaires had showed her the difference between her father

and theirs, oil magnates and steel and railway magnates, and magnates

who magnated on their ancestors' fortunes made in land or skins of

animals.
Nothing really worth having—nothing really worth father's years of

hard work—could come to them as a family until Peter Rolls ceased to

identify himself personally with the Hands, Ena had pleaded, and at

last the head of the establishment engaged an official "understudy" to

represent him every day in the gorgeously furnished office which had

seemed to old Peter what the body is to the soul.
Rolls senior and Henry Croft, the man he appointed as dictator,

corresponded daily, by letter and telephone, but Peter Rolls himself

was not supposed to enter the great commercial village he had brought

together under one roof. Ena was able to say to any one rude enough to

ask, or to those she suspected of indiscreet curiosity: "Father never

goes near the place. He's tired of business, and, luckily, he

doesn't need to bother."
She would not much have cared whether the statement were true or not

if she were sure that the carefully careless sounding words were

believed. But it would have been distressing to have any one say: "Ena

Rolls pretends that her father doesn't work in the shop any more, but

I know for a fact that he goes every day." So it comforted her to feel

sure that her arguments had really impressed father and that he never

did go to the Hands unless, perhaps twice a year or so for important

meetings. It pleased her that he had joined a rich club in New York

which had enough "swell" members to make it pleasant for her to remark

casually, "Father belongs to the Gotham."
When father went to New York in the evening, as he often did, not

returning to Sea Gull Manor till late, and sometimes staying away all

night, he used to say as an excuse to mother or Ena: "I'm going to the

club." After a while it was taken for granted, and he made no excuse

at all. But if Ena had known the mystery of those late evenings she

would have been struck with fear—the fear which comes of finding out

that those we think we know best are strangers to us.
Of all the sad millionaires of New York who pin together the pages of

certain mysterious life chapters not to be read by eyes at home,

perhaps no other had a mystery like that of Peter Rolls. It was now

the one thing that he intensely enjoyed; but it was a guilty, furtive

enjoyment which made a nervous wreck of him and ruined a stomach once

capable of salvation.
Peter junior had never been entirely happy since he left Yale at

twenty-three. It was only then that he began to look life in the face

and see the freckles on its complexion The minute he saw them on that

countenance which should be so beautiful, he wanted to help in some

way to rub them off. To help—to help! That was the great thing.
He didn't care much for business, but he felt that, being Peter

Rolls's only son, it was his duty to care. He imagined father deeply

hurt at the indifference of his two children to that which had been

his life—hurt, but hiding the wound with proud reserve. So Peter

junior determined to sacrifice himself. He offered to go into the

shop, to begin at the bottom if father wished, and in learning all

there was to learn, gradually work up to a place where he could be a

staff to lean upon.
It was in the "library" that they had this talk—an immense and

appalling room, all very new oak panelling and very new, uniform sets

of volumes bound in red leather and gold, with crests and bookplates,

bleakly glittering behind glass doors. Peter senior tried to kill time

there, because a library seemed to his daughter the right background

for a father, and Peter junior, who had saved mother's poor old

furniture for his own rooms, found it singularly difficult to open his

heart between walls that smelled of money and newness. However, he did

his best to blunder out the offer of himself; while the chill gleam in

his father's eyes (so remarkably like that of the bookcase glass

doors) made him feel, as he went on, that he must have begun all

wrong.
"So you don't trust your own father?" was the answer he got when he

stopped, as one might be stopped short by the sharp edge of a marble

mantelpiece when trying to find the way across a dark room.
"Don't—trust you?" stammered Peter, sure now that he was a fool not

to understand, not to have made his father understand.
"You think the old man's got past running his own business, and if

you don't want your money to go to the dogs you must look after it

yourself."
"Good heavens, no!" Peter broke out. "You can't dream that any such

thought entered my mind! I—why, Father, I'd rather die than have you

believe that of me."
"Prove I'm wrong, then," said the elder dryly, pulling, as was his

habit, a thin, grizzled beard with thin, sallow fingers. "You can do

it easy enough."
"How? Only tell me."
"By turning your attention to other things, my boy. Leave me alone to

manage what I know how to manage. You let me do it my own way, without

shoving in your oar, and don't you listen to what any of your highbrow

friends say about me and my methods behind my back."
"As if I would!"
"Well, I wasn't sure. You go with a set of raw boys who think they

know better than their fathers how to run creation; and now and then

you blow off some of those soap-bubble ideas in your conversation.

I've been kind of hurt once in a while, though I didn't let it out.

But now we're on the subject I will say: if you've got faith in the

old man, hands off the Hands!"
"That settles it, Father," returned Peter heavily. "I never meant to

hinder, only to help if I could. From now on the watchword is, 'hands

off the Hands!'"
This was a promise, and he kept it scrupulously. But the steady fire

in his heart was scattered as a flaming log is broken into many embers

by the clumsy stab of a poker. He had no longer a settled aim in life.

He saw no niche which he could fill, and felt that the world had no

particular use for the second Peter Rolls. The one thing he had

longed for as a boy, which did not now in his young manhood appear

stale and unprofitable, was a journey round the world and a glimpse of

the East. When his father said uneasily: "Why don't you travel, my

boy?" Peter answered that perhaps it would be a good thing.
The subject was broached to mother, and mother did not object. She had

learned long ago, when she was first married to Peter, never to object

to anything that he proposed. When she smiled and agreed with every

suggestion she was a dear little woman, and so she had spent her

existence in being a dear little woman until her hair turned white.

With her sunny nature, it had not needed a very great effort; but

sometimes, since Peter had begun to grow up, he had dimly fancied a

look of wistfulness in her ever-young blue eyes—eyes of a girl gazing

out from the round, rosy-apple face of a middle-aged woman.
She was always the same in her ways and manner, if it could be called

manner: comfortable and comforting, contented with life as it was,

happy in her children, and putting up gently with her husband;

but—when you had said good-bye to her you remembered the look which

always changed instantly into a smile when it met yours. You

remembered, and seemed to see another woman hovering wraithlike behind

mother's plump figure, as she sat contentedly crocheting those endless

strips of trimming for towels and things—mother as she might have

been if no dominating nature had ringed hers in with an iron fence.
When Peter was up the White Nile, in elephant and lion land, he used

suddenly, mysteriously, to see an irrelevant vision of his mother

just stretching out plump arms to say good-bye to him in his own room

which he had furnished with the mahogany odds and ends that had

started her bridal housekeeping. She had smiled and had not seemed to

mind very much his going—not half as much as a hen mother minds its

duckling's first dash into water. And yet her eyes—There are some

things it hurts and at the same time warms your heart to think of at

the other end of the world.
Peter had gone up the White Nile to shoot big game; but when he met it

face to face, on a social equality, so to speak, he wondered how he

could ever have harboured so monstrously caddish a design. He found

the animals he had thought he wanted to kill so much handsomer and

more important than himself that he felt like begging the alleged

"game's" pardon for calling on it without invitation in its country

home (as if he'd been a book agent), and bowed himself away with only

a few photographs to remember it by. While Ena was working up

conversations to the point of mentioning "my brother, who is such a

great shot, you know, and is shooting big game in Africa," Peter's

only shots were snapshots, and he was too stupidly conscientious to

atone for his weakness by obtaining elephant tusks and lion skins with

coins instead of bullets.
He wished he had saved Egypt and its temples for his honeymoon, in

case he should ever find exactly the right girl, for the mystery and

wonder made him sad because he had nobody to feel it with him. It was

the same in India and all the East, and there were thousands of

thoughts imprisoned in his breast (which he hardly understood and

dared not let escape) by the time he arrived in England to meet Ena.
They were still struggling in prison when he went on board the

Monarchic, but there a light shone fitfully through the keyhole of

the cell. It was a beautiful light, almost beautiful enough to be a

light Peter had read and dreamed of which was said never to shine on

land or sea. Then, suddenly and surprisingly, it went out. The prison,

full of thoughts, was left a place of dark confusion.
This was the inner state of Peter Rolls, Jr., when he arrived at home

after his long absence. But outwardly he appeared to be much as usual,

and was so nice to the Irish guests that Ena was grateful, though

never remorseful. Indeed, she had so much to think about that she

almost forgot her little act of diplomacy in eliminating an

undesirable sister-in-law.
She was on tenterhooks lest Lord Raygan and his mother and sister

should be finding the ménage at Sea Gull Manor "all wrong," and

laughing secretly at father and mother. If there had been that fear

about the dressmaker's model on top of the rest of her anxieties she

would have broken down with nervous prostration. But, thanks to her

for saving him (without his knowledge), Peter seemed to have got over

his silliness and was able to stand by her like a brick.
Lady Raygan, a singularly young-looking, red-faced woman of boyish

figure, and with stick-out teeth, was a leading militant suffragette.

When she embarked hastily for Queenstown she had just been rescued by

her son from the London police. At first she had been too seasick to

care that she was being carried past her home and that a series of

lectures she had intended giving would be delayed. Now, in America,

she had determined to make the best of a bad bargain by sending the

fiery cross through the States.
She stayed in her room and jotted down notes. Also, she

conscientiously tried to make Mrs. Rolls a suffragette. About most

other things she was absent-minded; therefore Ena did not waste gray

matter in worrying over the impression that Sea Gull Manor was making

on Lady Raygan.
It was Rags and Eileen whose observing eyes and sense of humour had to

be feared. Eileen, for instance, had a little way of saying that

anything she considered odd was "too endlessly quaint." Things she

admired were "melting." If only Ena had known enough about earls and

their families to be sure whether Lord Raygan and Eileen would, in

their secret hearts, think the ways of the Rollses endlessly quaint or

melting, she might have been spared sleepless nights. Because the

difference between those two adjectives would mean the difference

between ecstasy and despair for her. Rags might be poor for an earl,

even an Irish earl, but he was hardly the sort to propose to a girl

his sister could speak of as "endlessly quaint."
Twelve days after they had arrived at Sea Gull Manor, Eileen wrote a

somewhat ungrammatical letter to a rich cousin in Dublin who had once

refused Rags, and in which she said:
DEAR POBBLES:
I wish you were here to pinch me. Then I would be sure whether I'm

asleep or awake. You'll know by the papers (s'pose poor old Rags is

worth a paragraph; anyhow Mubs is, now she's turned into a suff) how

we got carried on in the Monarchic to New York. It won't be the

fault of American reporters if you've missed our news! They got at us

on the dock. Mubs loved it. Rags didn't.
Well, if you know a thing about us, since we were swept past

Queenstown by a giant wave that carried us on its back all the way to

America, you know we're staying with a family named Rolls. Rags met

Miss Rolls and her brother in London. And afterward they happened to

be on board our ship, so we chummed up, and Miss Rolls would give up

her melting suite to poor half-dead Mubs and me. What a beast the sea

is! I don't know if I shall ever have the courage to go on the

disgusting old wet thing again. We came here to stay a fortnight, but

it's almost that now, and we couldn't be driven away with a stick.
We're having the time of our lives (I'm learning lots of creamy

American slang), and the Rollses are awfully kind. Ena is very nice,

when she doesn't try to talk as if she were English, and quite

handsome, with fine eyes, though not so good as her brother's. And

he—the brother, I mean—is the dearest thing in the shape of a man

you ever saw. Not that he's wonderfully handsome or anything, but, as

they say over here, he's just IT. I don't know what there is about

him, but—well, if I go on, I suppose you'll think I'm being silly.
I don't care; you were only a year older than I am now when you told

Rags kindly to go to the dickens. You said he cared only for your

money, poor Rags! That wasn't true. But now (I know you won't tell)

Ena R. is going for him for all she's worth. Mubs doesn't notice

anything about women except their being suffs or not; and I'm supposed

to be too young to twig what's going on. I need hardly mention,

however, that very little gets past yours truly. I shouldn't wonder if

Ena'd bring it off. Rags asks me sometimes in a sheep-faced sort of

way what I think of things here, and I would have a joyous laugh with

him if it weren't for the brother.
Goodness gracious, but they're rich, these Rollses! I could make a pun

about their name and their money, but I won't, because it would be

cheap, and nothing is cheap at Sea Gull Manor. You can get a faint

idea what the house and the view are like from the hand-painted sketch

at the top of this paper on the left of the fat gold crest. This

stationery is in all the guests' private sitting-rooms in case any one

wants to make distant friends envious of their surroundings. Mr.

Rolls, Sr., told me he kept a tame artist painting these things at a

salary of ten thousand dollars a year, dinner and luncheon menus

thrown in. Ena's idea. She wanted something original, and what she

wants goes! So says Mr. R.
He's a poor little, yellow shrimp of a man, with dead-black hair,

where it isn't gray or coming off, and the same kind of beard goats

have. His eyes may have been nice when he was young, but nothing like

his son Peter's. Young Peter is altogether different from old Peter,

and he has blue eyes like the quaintest and most melting mother you

ever saw.
She does nothing but crochet trimming for sheets and things, world

without end, and if you admire it she gives you some. But she was just

born to be a mother, and even having her sit crocheting in a room

where you are makes you feel good. She has eyes as blue as bluebells,

and as young, an apple face with a smile that longs for something it's

never known, and any amount of smooth white hair, which she does in

just the wrong way, pinched into tight braids. The one thing she won't

do for her daughter is to have a maid of her own, and Ena keeps

apologizing for it.
Mr. Rolls is a terrible dyspeptic, and the only things he can digest

(he has told me and Rags several times) are soft-shelled crabs,

devilled, and plum pudding or cake. When he has a pain he paces floors

like a tiger, but does not roar.
I haven't met many Americans here yet because the Rollses somehow

don't seem to know the right ones, and Ena makes excuses for that,

too. I wish she wouldn't. It gets on my nerves, and Rag's nerves as

well, I fancy, though he doesn't say so, and he's thinking a lot about

whether she'll do. Because I haven't met many others, I don't know

whether or not the Rollses are just like all American millionaires who

don't come abroad, or unique. But I have an idea they're unique.
This is the most enormous house, built and named to please Ena,

though it's no more a manor than the Albert Hall is. I don't believe

she knows what "manor" means. Every bedroom I've seen (and I think

I've been shown all, if I haven't lost count) has its own bathroom

adjoining, and a sitting-room as well. In each bathroom there are

several different kinds of baths, and a marble one you step down into,

but it's bitterly cold on your spine—the only cold thing in the

house, which is so hot with a furnace that even the walls and floors

feel warm, although I keep my windows wide open day and night.
The pillow-cases and sheets are made of such rich, thick linen, and

are so smooth and polished that you slip down off your pillows with a

crick in your neck, and the sheets slide off you, just as if they were

made of heavy silver, like lids of dishes. Perhaps the monograms and

crests drag them down. It's awful, but it's grand. And I should think

there are at least twenty footmen with—if you'll believe me—powdered

hair!
Of course, poor Ena took a fancy to it in England. I don't think she

stayed at any houses, but she was at some hotel where they have it, so

she didn't see why not. If you ring a bell, dozens of these

helpless-looking, white-headed creatures in black and yellow simply

swarm from every direction, like great insects when you've poured hot

water into their hive—or hole.
If any really nice people happen to stop in their motor for any reason

at the house in the morning, say about eleven o'clock, they are

offered magnums of champagne, as if out of gratitude for their coming.

They hardly ever seem to do more than sip, so perhaps the black and

yellow insects get the rest. There's an English butler, and it would

make your heart bleed, or else you'd want to howl, if you saw his

agonized, apologetic look whenever you, as a British person, knowing

about other ways of running a house, happened to catch his elderly

eye.
Mr. and Mrs. Rolls get up at goodness knows what hour and have

breakfast together, so does Petro—that's the nickname for the son.

But Ena and Mubs and Rags and I can wallow as long as we like and have

gorgeous breakfasts in our rooms. Mubs thinks Mrs. R. is a fool,

because she can hardly understand what a woman wants with a vote, but

I think she's a dear. She sends cartloads of flowers to hospitals,

and if you speak of a charity she hauls handfuls of dollar bills out

of an immense gold chain bag she always carries on her arm because

Petro gave it to her for a birthday present, and it, and Ena's one, a

size smaller, has the fat air of containing all her luggage ready to

start off from Saturday to Monday at a moment's notice. I suppose it's

money that looks so plump.
Now do you think Rags ought to resist the daughter of such a house

when church mice have long ago cut our acquaintance? Of course, Rags

is lucky at bridge (he gave me a lovely dress on board ship), but he

can't live on it regularly. So far it's a toss up. I'll let you know

how things go.
Mubs is writing an article for an American newspaper which has offered

her fifty pounds. This is the first fun she's ever got out of being a

countess—and now I shouldn't wonder if she'd be a dowager soon! As

for me, I'm trying to flirt with Petro. No, to be honest, that isn't

quite true. I'm not exactly flirting. He's too good for that. Ena

says he's "glue," because he has no interest in life, and that it'll

cheer him up if I encourage him to talk to me about some

philanthropical schemes he has.
One is a "Start in Life Fund" for deserving and clever young people

who need only a hand up to get on. I wish I could go in for it

myself—but perhaps I'm not deserving or clever. Anyhow Ena says her

brother likes me awfully, better than any girl he ever saw before,

and that he thinks me pretty. Did you ever? No wonder I like him! I

shouldn't mind his knowing that I do, as Ena says he thinks no girl

could care for him. That sounds pathetic. I let her know that, as he's

so despairingly modest, she might break it to him that I enjoy his

society. Since then he's been much nicer, though, perhaps still a

little absent-minded, which may come from being "blue." I should like

to know what Ena said to him! But I suppose it's all right!


Your chum and cousin,
EILY.

P.S. They've got a shop in New York. I forgot to tell you that—a huge

shop. It's never mentioned here, but Petro told me. He's not ashamed,

but rather proud of the way the money came. Rags wants him and Ena to

take us to the place.
What Ena did say to Peter was, "Poor little Eileen is falling in love

with you." Peter didn't believe it. But it put a strange idea into his

head.
 
 
CHAPTER XIII
ONE MAN AND ANOTHER
"No. 2884 Child, W. Pay Envelope. Details under flap," Winifred read

on the neat, pale-brown packet put into her hand the night when she

had served Peter Rolls for a week—or was it five hundred weeks? "READ

THE OTHER SIDE" was printed in capital letters of white upon a black

background on the flap which must be torn open to get at the contents

and "details." The latter consisted of "Deductions, Absent, Late

Fines, Keys, Mdse., Stamps, Beneficial Ass., and Sub. Slips."
But Win had been neither absent nor late. Being an extra hand only,

and liable to be "dispensed with" at the end of the holidays, she had

not needed to subscribe her hard-earned pennies to Beneficial

Assurance, that huge fund made up of weekly coppers, whose interest

was to Peter Rolls almost what "Peter's Pence" are to the Pope. Thanks

to her good health and good behaviour, "Cash Enclosed" (as secretly

mentioned under the flap) was practically intact. But it had been a

nightmare week which seemed longer than all the past weeks of her life

added together and if she had earned a hundred dollars instead of six

she would not have felt too highly paid.
She moved wearily away from the office window, obeying the directions

to "read other side," and as she walked down the long corridor (her

sore feet causing her to limp slightly) the words "if sick or

disabled, notify employment bureau at once" sang through her head,

keeping time with her uneven steps.
She was "reading the other side," the other side of life which

appeared to her as separate from the side she had known as the bright

was separate from the dark side of the moon; the side about which

people seldom troubled and never saw. A few weeks ago, before that

"wild spirit" of hers lured her half across the world to find

independence, she would have thought, feeling as she felt to-night,

that she was both sick and disabled. But now she knew that hundreds of

other girls under this very roof felt just as she felt, and that they

took it for granted as a normal condition of life. They hardly pitied

themselves, and she must be as stoical. If once she lost courage, she

might do the thing she had boasted to Peter Rolls, Jr., that she would

never do—cry.
She thought to find a tonic effect from the sight of money earned, and

in taking out her six dollars, she let fall a slip of white paper from

the pay envelope. It fluttered away, to alight on the floor, and Win's

heart beat as she picked it up.
Her discharge already? What could she have done to be sent off at the

end of a week—she who had tried so hard? And how strange that, tired

and disheartened as she was, she should actually fear discharge! A

minute ago she had been asking herself, "How many weeks like this can

I live through?" and wishing that an end, almost any end, might come.

Yet here she was dreading to turn the slip over (she had retrieved it

blank side up) and read her doom.
"You are requested to call at the superintendent's private office

Monday, twelve forty-five," was neatly typewritten precisely in the

middle of the paper.
Win did not know whether to be relieved or alarmed.
"I'll ask Sadie what she thinks," was her quick decision. But Sadie

was not available this evening. An "old chum" had asked Miss Kirk out

to supper, and Miss Child having snubbed her faithful lion man for

reasons which had appeared good at the time, had no one to give her

the key to those dozen mystic words which might as well have been

written in cipher.
"And even Sadie can't tell for certain," she reflected. "I can't

possibly know till Monday noon."
All the fatigue and nerve strain of six dreadful days and six

appalling nights seemed suddenly to culminate in a fit of overpowering

restlessness. Worn out though she was (or all the more because of

that, perhaps) she could not go "home" to Columbus Avenue, where the

"L" that Sadie said should be spelled with an "H" ran past her window.
She was sure if she sat down or went to bed she should think more

about her aching back and burning feet than if she walked. She longed

for the sweet, kind air of heaven to ripple past her hot cheeks like

cool water. She longed for stars to look up to, and for the purple

peace and silence of night after the clamour of the store and before

the babel of Columbus Avenue, into which presently she must plunge.
"I'll walk in the park," she proposed to herself. "It will do me good.

When I'm too tired, I can rest for a few minutes on one of the seats

and hear myself think."
That was one of the many disadvantages of "home." There you could

hear at the same time almost every other sound which could be produced

in the world, but you could not hear yourself think.
Earl Usher was not to be seen as she came out into the street, and Win

was glad. Once or twice to-day she had half repented the snub which,

perhaps, he had not meant to deserve, but now she thanked it for his

absence. Swiftly she walked away, though still with the just

perceptible limp that most shop girls have in their first few weeks of

"business."
She did not look up at the giant Hands with their blazing rings, as

she had looked at first, half admiring, half awed. Their gesture now

seemed greedy. They were trying to "grab the whole sky," as the lion

tamer said. Rather would one hurry to escape from under them, and go

where the Hands of Peter Rolls could not reach.
It was exquisite in the park, and she was thinking how a delicate,

floating blue curtain appeared to shut her away for a little while

from all the harshness of life, when a small and singularly silent

automobile glided by. A lamp showed her the forms of two men in the

open car, one in front, who drove, and one behind, who sat with arms

folded.
"How heavenly to have the air and lean back restfully without needing

to walk," thought tired Win.
She was envying the comfortable figure with its arms folded when the

little car turned and, to her astonishment, drew up close beside her.

Involuntarily she stopped; then, as one of the men jumped out, she

regained her presence of mind and walked on at top speed.
The man strode along after her, however, and spoke.
"Don't you remember me? That's very unkind. You might wait a minute,

anyhow, and let me remind you where we met. I recognized you as I

went by, that's why I came back."
Wondering if it could be possible that they had met, Win ventured a

glance at the face on a level with her own. She knew instantly that

never had she seen it before.
"You're mistaken," she said. "I don't know you. Please go."
"Logan is my name," he persisted. "Jim Logan. Now don't you remember?

But you didn't tell me your name that other time."
Win took longer steps. This active hint did not, however trouble Mr.

Logan. He was an inch or so taller than she, perhaps, and kept step

with the utmost ease.
"You and I might have been at the same dancing school," said he. "I'm

doing the newest stunt—the wango. Is that what you're doing, too? Or

is it the y-lang-y-lango? I could go on like this all night! I hope

you're not engaged to anybody else for the next dance?"
"As a matter of fact, I am," said Win sharply, though it was all she

could do not to laugh. "My partner will very much object to you."
"That's all right. It's not likely he knows jiu-jitsu as well as I

do," cheerfully replied the man, still hurrying on at the same pace.

He kept half a step in advance of the girl, as if to be prepared in

case she should begin to run; and thus, without seeming to look, Win

could see him in profile.
He was so smartly dressed that, in England, he would have been called

a "nut." What was the American equivalent for a nut, she did not know.

He had a hawk-nosed profile which might have been effective had not

his undercut jaw stuck out aggressively, suggesting extreme, hectoring

obstinacy, even cruelty.
She had time to see that his hair was an uninteresting brown, and his

skin the ordinary sallow skin of the man about town. But suddenly he

took her unawares, turning to face her with disquieting abruptness.

She caught an impression of eyes sparkling in the lamplight; small and

set close on either side of a high-bridged, narrow nose, yet bright

and boldly smiling. His voice was that of an educated person and not

disagreeable in tone, but Win was anxious to escape hearing it again.
He seemed to wait for an answer, and when it did not come, he went on:
"You ought to go in for an Olympic race. You're all for them in

England. I'm out of training, but I can stand this as long as you can,

I bet. The only thing is, I wanted to take you for a run in my auto,

it's such a nice, crisp night. I'll drive you home, if you say the

word."
"The thing wished for comes when your hands are tied," says the

Turkish proverb. Win had been yearning for a spin. She kept silence

and sped on, wondering whether she could surprise the enemy by

executing a sudden right-about-face.
"Have you been in this country long?" he inquired.
No answer.
"Oh, indeed, is that so? I thought you hadn't! Are you living in New

York at present? Don't be afraid to tell me. Even if you are, that

won't drive me out of the little old burg. See here, you're mighty

restless. And you do hate to part with much of your conversation at

one time, don't you? You're a peach, all right, but a spiced peach

preserved in vinegar."
Winifred wheeled and began walking east even faster than she had been

walking west. In the distance a tall—a very tall—figure was

approaching, like a ship under full sail. Could it be–– Yes, it was!

Bless the light of the lamp that showed him! Now indeed she dared to

laugh.
"Here comes that partner of mine at last!" she exclaimed and almost

ran to met the lion tamer.
"Good Lord! Very well, I can't hope to compete against cigar signs,"

replied Mr. Logan. "I was unprepared for Goliath. Little David will

fade away till he gets his sling. You make me forget my name and

telephone number, but this is where I get off at. Please remember me

next time."
"I will, when next time comes!" Win was tempted to toss after him

impudently as, lifting his cap, the motorist took a hasty short cut to

the motor. Win was actually laughing when Earl Usher joined her. She

felt safe, and not even tired. The little adventure had had its uses,

after all! It had been, she thought, just as beneficial and not nearly

so expensive as a tonic or a Turkish bath.
"Was that mutt a gentleman friend of yours, kid, or was he some fresh

guy? 'Cause, if he was playing the fool, I'll break into the game and

go for his blood," remarked the rescuer.
"It was a Mr. Logan," replied Win hurriedly, making up her mind that

she must avoid any chance of trouble. "But—but I don't like him

much," she added. "I was very glad when I saw you. And I'm not going

to scold you for following me, because I know you meant well—and, as

it happened, it's ending well. For a reward, I forgive you

everything. And I've just thought of a new name for you, Mr. Usher."
"Hope it's some better than Sadie Kirk's."
"What—Teddy Bear? Yes, it's better than that. Did you ever read 'Quo

Vadis?'"
"Not on your life. Sounds like a patent medicine."
"It's a novel. And in it a great, good giant of a young man devotes

himself to rescuing a maiden named Lygia. His name was Ursus,

and he was so strong he could bring a bull to its knees––"
"Why, you silly little kid, that's a movie, not a novel. I've seen

Ursus and his bull, all right. You're makin' me stuck on myself. I

feel as if I was it."
"Well, you are it. I christen you Ursus. And thank you very much for

taking so much trouble about me."
"I didn't take trouble," protested Ursus, half afraid that he was

being "kidded." "All I did was to beat it after you at what the swell

reporters call a respectful distance just to see you safe home if you

meant to hoof it. When you shot into the park, thinks I, 'maybe she's

made a date to chat with a gentleman friend, so I'll hang back.'

But––"
"It was quite an accident, meeting Mr. Logan, I assure you, Ursus,"

said Win, still unwilling to confide in him the details of the late

encounter, which seemed ridiculous now it was over. "I wanted a breath

of air. I've had it, and if you'll be very good and never use such a

word again as you did night before last, you may walk home with me if

you like."
"What word do you refer to? Cutie?"
"Yes. And another still more offensive."
"Sweetie?"
"Yes. Disgusting! 'Kid's' bad enough. But I thought you mightn't know

any better. I draw the line at the others."
"All right," said Ursus rather sulkily, sure that he was being made

fun of now. "But when a chap's a girl's friend what is he to call

her?"
"'You' will do very well, if 'Miss Child' is beyond your vocabulary."
"I don't call that bein' friends. Say, is that your mutt's automobile

sort of following along in our wake?"
"I don't know, for I don't want to look back," said Win. (They were

out of the park by this time.) "But—I've changed my mind about

walking all the way. Let's hurry and take a Fifty-Ninth Street car!"

By day, in the shop, Win could laugh when she thought of the Columbus

Avenue house where she and Sadie "hung out." But at night, in her

room, trying desperately to sleep, she could not even smile. To do so,

with all those noises fraying the edges of her brain, would be to

gibber!
In that neighbourhood front rooms were cheaper than rooms at the back.

Lodgers who could afford to do so paid extra money for a little extra

tranquillity. Neither Sadie Kirk nor Winifred Child was of these

aristocrats. Their landlady had thriftily hired two cheap flats in a

fair-sized house whose ground floor was occupied by a bakery, and

whose fire-escapes gave it the look of a big body wearing its skeleton

outside. She "rented" her rooms separately, and made money on the

transaction, though she could afford to take low prices.
In the street below the narrow windows surface cars whirred to and fro

and clanged their bells. In front of the windows, and strangely,

terribly near to the six-inch-wide balconies, furnished with withered

rubber plants, roared the "L" trains, jointed, many-eyed dragons

chasing each other so fast that there seemed to be no pause between at

any hour of the day or during most hours of the night. Private life

behind those windows was impossible unless you kept your blinds down.

If you forgot, or said wildly to yourself that you didn't care, that

you must breathe and see your own complexion by daylight at any

cost, thousands of faces, one after the other, stared into yours. You

could almost touch them, and it was little or no consolation to

reflect when they had seen you brushing your hair or fastening your

blouse, that these travellers in trains would never hear your name or

know who you were.
As for a bath—but then the great, magnificent advantage of living at

Mrs. McFarrell's was the bathroom. It was dark and small and smelled

of the black beetles who lived happily around the hot-water pipes. You

were not expected to take more than one bath a week, and for that one

bath towel was provided free.
"Oh, I thought you'd had your bath this week!" was the answer Win

got on her second night, when mildly asking for a towel which had

disappeared. But if you were silly enough to pay thirty cents extra

for putting water on your body every day, you could do so. And, anyhow

a bathroom was a splendid advertisement. One lodger told another:

"The use of the bathroom is thrown in."
That night, when Win had bathed and laid herself carefully down in the

narrow bed which shook and groaned as if suffering from palsy, it

seemed more impossible than ever to go to sleep. Each new train that

rumbled by was a giant, homing bee, her brain the hive for which it

aimed. Her hot head was crowded with thoughts, disturbing, fighting,

struggling thoughts, yet the giant bee pushed the throng ruthlessly

aside and darted in. Each time it seemed impossible to bear it again.

She felt as if she had caterpillars in her spine and ants on her

nerves.
Win thought about the superintendent, Mr. Meggison, and wondered again

and again whether she would be discharged or whether he had merely

"taken a fancy" to her looks and wished to see if she were

flirtatiously inclined. She knew now, from Sadie, that Meggison's

desire was to be a "gay dog," though his courage did not always march

with his ambition.
The red-haired girl, Sadie supposed, had perhaps come to the Hands

armed with an introduction from some "lady friend." This theory would

account for Meggison's mysterious murmur of, "That's different." What

should she—Win—do if Father invited her to dine with him, as it

seemed he did invite some of the girls? Sadie said that if such a

thing happened to her she would accept, because she wasn't afraid of

Father. She "could scare him more than he could scare her," and an

extra hand might "get the push" if she refused a civil invitation.
With Mr. Croft, "Saint Peter's Understudy," it was more dangerous. You

had to beware of him. If you were a "looker," like Win, the best

thing that could happen to you was never to come within eyeshot of

Henry Croft. He lived in the suburbs, was married, and the

superintendent of a Sunday school. His name was on all the charity

lists. He was so tall and thin and sprawling that he looked like a

human hatrack, and his solemn circle of a face, surrounded with

yellowish whiskers, had a sunflower effect. He had written a book,

"Week-Day Sermons by a Layman"; nevertheless, he was a terror.
There were, according to Sadie, girls in the store who were of no more

use as saleswomen than baby alligators would have been, but they "gave

the glad eye" to Mr. Croft, and accepted his flowers and invitations

for moonlight motor rides. Nearly every one knew, but nobody told.
What use? Who was there to tell? Croft was "up at the top and then

some." Only Saint Peter himself stood above. And who would dare

complain to Saint Peter about his respectable right hand? Even if

there were any chance of getting near P.R., which there wasn't. He

came mostly at night, as if it were a disgrace to show himself in a

shop, even if it was his own. If ever he did any "prowling" in

business hours, it was with the understudy glued to his side.
As for "sweating" and "grinding" there wasn't a cent's worth of

difference between Croft and Meggison, said Sadie. Nevertheless, Win

was feeling thankful, as the "L" train bees boomed through her brain,

that at worst it was Mr. Meggison who had mysteriously summoned her,

not Mr. Croft.
If only she could go to sleep and forget them both, and the trains

and the cars and the man in the park and Miss Stein, who still had

against her a "grouch." If only she could forget even big, blundering

Ursus, who wanted to treat her to oyster stews that he couldn't afford

and take her to a dance hall next Sunday! And Sadie, too, who knew

such strange and awful things about the world and life, although she

was so good.
But no. Impossible to stop thinking, impossible to forget, impossible

to sleep. All New York seemed to be about her ears. She could hear the

frantic rush of everything which true New Yorkers love, and she could

feel its sky-scrapers closing in around her like an unclimbable wall.

As she thought of the great, noisy city she saw it consisting entirely

of vastly high towers, with inhabitants who spent their time in

tearing about—people who looked at her in the street as if she were

not there, or, if she was, they would rather she were somewhere else.
She dared not picture the ship sailing for England nearly every day of

the week. If she were free to do what she liked—or almost what she

liked—she would go at least as often as every Saturday to watch a big

liner move out from the dock, just for the delicious torture of it.
And yet—did she want to go back home? Whenever she asked herself this

question—and it was often—invariably for some silly reason, she saw

the blue, wistful eyes of that hypocrite, the younger Peter Rolls.

Also there came upon her a choking sense of homelessness, a

mother-want in a lonely world. But, as Sadie Kirk agreed with her in

saying, "What was the good of squeezing juice out of your eyes just

because you happened to be low in your mind?" No, she would not cry!
Then, after all, she dropped asleep in a minute's interval between

trains, and dreamed that she was lost in Fifty-Ninth Street. It was as

long as the way to England, and a ghastly street to be lost in. Its

sky line—if it knew anything about the sky—was as irregular as a

Wagner dragon's teeth—high buildings and low buildings, and shanties

where coloured families lived; little, sinister-looking houses where

people could be murdered and their bodies never found, shops where you

could buy everything you didn't want and nothing that you did.
In the dream black and white children were fighting and skating on

roller skates over the pavement. Cars were clanging bells. Everybody

and everything was making a noise of some sort. Win was trying to get

past the skaters and catch a car. She must, or she would be late for

something! But what? This was horrible. She was going somewhere, and

could not remember where or what she had to do. She was lost forever,

and had forgotten her name and the name of the street where she lived.

A roller-skating boy with the face of a black monkey threw her down,

and a surface car and Peter Rolls's automobile were about to run over

her when she waked with a jump that shook the palsied bed. Another "L"

train booming by!
Despite lack of sleep and a tiredness of body that Sunday could not

cure, Win had never looked more attractive than when, at precisely

twelve forty-five on Monday afternoon she presented herself at Mr.

Meggison's door.
This was his private den, and a visit there, even on a less alarming

errand than hers, was far more formidable than pausing for inspection

at an office window. Sadie, with the best intentions, had been able to

give little encouragement There must be scolding or else flirting in

prospect. And Winifred's eyes were bright, her cheeks pink, her head

high, as the superintendent's voice bade her "Come in."
 
 
CHAPTER XIV
FROM SCYLLA TO CHARYBDIS
She went in. Mr. Meggison sat in front of his roll-top desk. No such

world-shaking event as his rising to receive her took place. His

stenographer's chair was vacant. The cherubic aspect had for the

moment dominated Mephistopheles. Mr. Meggison was smiling. But Win did

not know whether to fear the smile or to thank her stars for it.
Little girls—and sometimes big ones—should be seen and not heard, so

Win waited in meek, flushed silence for the great man to speak.
"Shut the door, please, Miss—er—Miss Child," said he. And the

cherubic eyes gazing from under the fierce contradiction of heavy

eyebrows up to the tall girl's face conveyed to her mind that "please"

was a tribute. Also, she suddenly knew that the superintendent had

hesitated over her name on purpose. A man in a high position may wish

to be agreeable to a girl beneath him, at the same time informing her

that she is of no vast importance.
With a certain stiff young dignity Win shut the office door.
"You may as well sit down. I want to talk to you."
She sat down in the chair of Mr. Meggison's absent stenographer. By

this time the pink of her cheeks had deepened to red. She was

wondering more than ever what he was going to do, and what she would

do when he had done it. But as she sat facing him she realized that

she was no longer afraid. She felt a sense of power and resource.
"Are you surprised that I remember your name, Miss Child?" he asked.
"I don't know the custom," she replied primly. Would he expect her to

say "Sir?" Anyhow, she wouldn't! She compromised with a dainty

meekness which might be interpreted as respect for a superior. Mr.

Meggison fixed her with a sharp look which would have detected the

impudence of a lurking laugh.
"That's a funny answer," said he. "You 'don't know the custom!' Well,

my idea of you is, you don't know much about any business customs, on

our side of the water or yours either." As he spoke he watched her

face to catch any guilty flicker of an eyelid. "I want you to tell me

what was your idea in going for a job with us."
"I saw your advertisement for extra hands."
"The woods—I mean the papers—are full of advertisements. What made

you pick out ours?"
"I'd tried to get other things and failed."
"So we were a last resort, eh?"
"I thought first of being a governess or a companion or getting into a

public library or—things of that sort."
"Why not the stage? You're a good-looking girl, with a figure."
"I promised my father I wouldn't go on the stage. But, anyhow, I don't

suppose I could have got on—an amateur like me. Every place in New

York seems full up. And I have no training of any sort."
"Just a young lady, eh?"
Win smiled. "I never thought of it as a profession—or a label."
He looked slightly puzzled, and when Mr. Meggison was puzzled by an

employee, he was generally annoyed. This case seemed, however, to be

an exception. He kept his temper, and even condescended to grin.
"I don't want you should think I'm asking all these questions because

we have any fault to find with you," he said. "You've done very well.

I always know what's going on all over the place. I keep track of

everything in every department. I wouldn't be where I am if I wasn't

up to that. I called you here partly to compliment you on your

smartness in that little stunt of the first day. And you've gone on

all right since, all right. These things don't get lost in the wash.

But before I come to that I'm bound to tell you that the report's come

up to me you're a spy."
He threw the cap at her in a way to make her jump if it fitted. But

Win did not flinch. What she had overheard on the first day saved her

now from a shock of surprise.
"I caught that word about me from one of the girls," she admitted

frankly. "I wondered what made her think me a spy, and I'm wondering

still."
"I guess she thought you looked a sort of swell, and any one could see

you weren't used to work."
"But—there must be lots of girls like me in your big shops, just as

there are at home."
"No, that's where you're mistaken, Miss Child. There's more chances

with us for women than with you, and more places for 'em. We don't

get many of your class in the stores. They can do better for

themselves. You, being a stranger, though, had no pull. And maybe you

haven't been over here long."
"I haven't been long. But my money ran short," smiled Win, encouraged

now, since neither of Sadie's prognostications seemed likely to be

fulfilled. "Still, I don't see why it should occur to anybody that I

was a spy. What would a spy do in a shop?"
"That depends whether the job came from outside or in."
"I don't understand!"
"Well, there's a set of smart Alecks who've banded together and call

themselves the Anti-Sweat League, or Work People's Aid Society, or any

old name like that. They smell around to see what goes on behind the

scenes in a department store, and drop on us if they can."
"Oh, I see! And you thought they might have hired me––"
"I didn't think so, as a matter of fact. I pride myself on spotting

folks for what they are the minute I lamp them. There's something

about 'em I can feel. I was sure you weren't one of that bunch. But

I felt bound to mention the report. Now that's finished—breakfast

cleared away! We'll go on to the next thing."
Again Win waited. And her heart missed a beat, for Mr. Meggison was

looking at her as if he had something very special to say.
"Most of the extra people we let go the week after Christmas," he went

on slowly. "Even if they're smart, we have enough regular ones without

'em. But perhaps we can keep you if you make good. And if you want to

stay. Do you?"
"Yes, thank you. As far as I can tell now, I should like to stay, if I

give satisfaction," Win answered with caution.
"Well, we'll see. It's up to you, anyhow. I told you I was going to

test your character. That's why I put you where I did. I knew what

you'd be up against. Now the idea is to test you some more."
He paused an instant. This was a catch phrase of his: "the idea is."

He often used it. And when he said: "It is my habit," or "My way is,"

he spoke with the repressed yet bursting pride of the self-made man

who has suddenly been raised to a height almost beyond his early

dreams.
"I may change you into another department next week," he went on,

"where you'll have a better time and less work. What do you say to

Gloves?"
Win felt very stupid. "What ought I to say to Gloves?" she inquired

helplessly.
Then the great Mr. Meggison actually laughed. "Gee! You are an

amateur, Miss Child. Why, the girls all think the Gloves are the pick

of the basket. What your London Gaiety is to actresses, that the glove

department is to our salesladies. It's called the marriage market.

Ladies' and gents' gloves, you understand. Now do you see the

point?"
"I suppose I do," Win rather reluctantly confessed, faintly blushing.
"Some of the best lookers in our Gloves have married Fifth Avenue

swells. It's pretty busy there just now. The young fellows buy gloves

by the dozen for their best girls at Christmas time when they want to

ring a change on flowers. Maybe I'll put you into Gloves, if you'll

agree to make yourself useful."
"I'll try to do my best wherever you put me, Mr. Meggison" said Win,

sounding to herself like a heroine of a Sunday serial, and feeling not

unlike one in a difficult situation at the end of an instalment. At

home, in her father's house, she had occasionally been driven to read

Sunday serials on Sunday. They were the only fiction permitted on that

day.
"That's all right. But now I mean something in particular" explained

Meggison. "I told you what they were saying about you in your

department to see how you'd take it. Well, you didn't seem desperately

shocked at the idea of being engaged by a so-called charitable society

to watch out for any breaks we might make. Not that we do make any, so

your trouble would have been wasted. We give our girls seats and every

living thing the law asks for, and our men make no complaints that we

hear. But, of course, we ain't omnipotent. Things are said, things

happen we don't get onto, little tricks that cost us money. Folks

shirking, and even stealing; we have to keep a sharp lookout. We can't

turn the spotlights on to everybody at once. So when we come across a

pair of lamps that are bright, a long way above the average we

sometimes make it worth their while––"
"Oh, Mr. Meggison, please don't go on!" Win cut the great man short.

"I'd rather you didn't say it, because—I don't wish to hear. I—I

don't want to know what you mean."
It was his turn to flush. But the change of colour was only just

perceptible. He had himself under almost perfect control. His eyes

sent out a flash, then became dull and expressionless as blue-gray

marbles. He was silent and watchful. Win, after her outburst, was

breathlessly speechless.
"Good!" said he at last. "Very good. That's the second test. And it's

all right, like the first. Now do you understand?"
"I—I'm not sure. I––"
"You just said you didn't want to know what I meant. But I want you

to know. I was testing your character again. I'm sure now you're

straight. You're a good girl, as well as a smart one, Miss Child."
Suddenly, just as she had begun to feel so relieved that tears were on

the way to her eyes, Meggison bent forward with an abrupt movement and

laid his hot, plump hand heavily on hers. Up jumped the girl and down

fell the hand. She seemed to hear herself excusing herself and

explaining her rashness to Sadie: "I couldn't stand it. I wouldn't! I

didn't care what happened."
"What's the matter?" he asked, blustering, his face now very red. He

kept his seat and looked up at her with a bullish stare.
"Nothing is the matter, Mr. Meggison," she said. "Only I think I've

troubled you long enough. You—will be wanting me to go."
As she spoke she gazed straight and steadily down into his eyes, as if

he were an animal that could be mastered if your look never let his

go. She remembered how Sadie had said that Meggison wanted to be a

"dog," but his bark might be stopped if you showed him in time that

you were not afraid. Winifred was afraid, but she acted as if she

were not, which was the great thing. And the "stunt," as Sadie would

have called it, seemed to work—if only for the moment.
When his face had cooled, he said: "Yes, you can go, Miss Child. I've

nothing more to say to you—at present. Except this: it won't be the

Gloves."

Tingling, burning, whirling with the excitement of her

interview—fully felt only after it was over—Win started to hurry

back to work. It was not a crowded time of the day in the shopping

world. Many ladies were lunching not buying, and employees, if on

business, were permitted to use the elevators, white light going up,

red light down. Only the boy in smart shop livery, who rushed the lift

from roof to basement, was in the mirrored vehicle when Win got in at

the superintendent's floor.
"Hats, Children's Wardrobes, Games, Toys, Books, Stationery!" shouted

the strident young voice mechanically as the doors whizzed back in

their groove at the story below.
In streamed some jaded mothers and children, for whom Win backed

humbly into a corner, and then, just as the doors were about to snap

shut once more for a downward plunge, a young man and woman hurried

laughing in. Winifred Child shrank farther into her corner, plastering

herself against the wall of the elevator, and turning her face away,

for the newcomers were Lord Raygan and Ena Rolls.
As the wall consisted entirely of mirrors, however, turning away gave

little protection. The mothers, refusing to retire with their young

before the latest arrivals, "swell" though they might be, Miss Rolls

and her companion were forced to push past the forms which kept the

door, and by the time the elevator had shot down a story or two

farther the pair were close to Win. Still she kept her face twisted as

far over her shoulder as it would go, at risk of getting a cramp in

the neck, and her heart was beating with such loud thuds under the

respectable black blouse that she feared lest they should hear it.
"Why, hello—it's the Lady in the Moon!" exclaimed Lord Raygan gayly,

just when Win had begun to hope she might reach the ground-floor level

without being discovered.
Involuntarily Ena turned with a slight start, recognized Win,

pretended not to, and presented the back instead of the side of a

wonderful hat. An aigret jabbed viciously at the tall shop-girl's eye,

and Miss Rolls said hastily: "What Lady in the Moon? I don't know whom

you're talking about, Lord Raygan. But oh, here's our floor! This is

where I want to get out."
"Never mind, let's stop in and come up again," commanded Raygan in the

masterful way which Ena loved for its British male brutality—when it

didn't interfere with her wishes. "It's Miss—oh, you know, from the

Monarchic. Don't you remember her in the moon dress? How do you do,

Miss—er—er? Who would have thought of meeting you here?"
They were crowded almost as closely together in the lift as sardines

in a box, and it was impossible not to answer.
"How do you do?" responded Win desperately, and Miss Rolls, making

the best of a bad dilemma, found it obligatory to recognize Miss

Child. If she had not done so Lord Raygan would have thought her

snobbish, though it was not entirely from snobbishness that she had

wished to escape the girl of the Monarchic.
Her heart was beating almost as hard as Win's. Her brother Peter and

Lady Eileen were somewhere in the shop. This was the day chosen for

the sightseeing expedition insisted upon by Raygan. Ena had hated the

idea of it, hated having to be associated in Raygan's eyes with the

Hands. She had felt a presentiment that something horrid would happen,

but she hadn't supposed it would be quite so horrid and upsetting as

this.
A dozen times Petro had asked if she'd ever heard from Miss Child.

Only day before yesterday—the silly fellow never seemed to forget!

And any moment now he and Eileen might come. They had made a

rendezvous at the jewellery department, not far from this row of

elevators, on the ground floor. Hang the girl! How little delicacy she

had shown in taking a place in Peter Rolls's father's store after that

conversation on the ship! And how was she to be got rid of in a

desperate hurry without making Lord Raygan cross?
 
 
CHAPTER XV
THE LADY IN THE MOON
It was a difficult situation for Miss Rolls. Dimly it had dawned upon

her more than once that Rags regarded certain speeches and ways of

hers as "snobbish"—speeches and ways which to her had seemed

aristocratic. Neither Rags nor Eileen nor Lady Raygan had ever so much

as mentioned the word "snob" in connection with any member of the

Rolls family or their friends. But they had lightly let it drop in

connection with others, and Ena's extreme sensitiveness on the subject

her extreme desire to be everything that Raygan liked, made her quick

to put two and two together.
She began to see that many of her favourite tricks at home and

abroad—with servants, with her parents, with acquaintances, and the

public in general—were not proofs, in Raygan's eyes, that she was to

the manor born, rather the contrary, and that hurt. She was straining

to understand and observe the finest nuances. Never had it been more

difficult than to-day, during this visit she detested to the great

department store of Peter Rolls. If she had declined to come, that

would have been snobbish. If, having come, she refused the "glad hand"

to one of her father's shop girls whom Raygan chose to greet as an

equal—that, too, would be snobbish. And to be snobbish was, in

Raygan's language, to be "beastly vulgar."
If she were not snobbish—if she treated Miss Child with warm

cordiality, asked her a dozen questions, and listened kindly to the

answers, Petro would come with Eileen and find his long-lost friend.

Would Lord Raygan go so far in his dislike of snobbishness as to

welcome an assistant culled from his bride's father's shop as a

sister-in-law? Ena thought not. Besides, she was not sure yet that she

would ever be his bride, and any risk she took might turn the scale

against her, so uncertain seemed the balance. Just at present the

danger was that she might fall in the slippery space between two high

stools.
"Why, yes, of course, Lord Raygan," she said, able in the midst of

alarums to enjoy the repetition of his title, which made people stare.

"We'll stay in the elevator and talk to Miss Child, and go up again

when she has gone. Are you really working here in the store, Miss

Child, as—as—a––"
"Yes, I'm in the blouse department," Win replied, quite as anxious to

escape as Miss Rolls was anxious to blot her out. "I've been up to see

the superintendent on business, and now I'm hurrying back to work."
"You never wrote me," said Ena, thinking it was better to chatter than

let Lord Raygan talk, perhaps indiscreetly. And there were still more

floors at which the elevator must stop before reaching the ground

level. "I—I do trust you would have written if you'd wanted

anything done that I could do." Her tone tried not to be too

patronizing, lest patronage should be considered to verge on

snobbishness.
"Thank you. I never did want anything that you could do. Though it

was kind of you to offer," Win returned, and was aware that every one

was listening.
Oh, why had she believed Mr. Löwenfeld when he vowed that the one

secure sanctuary against the Rolls family was in Peter Rolls's store?

If only she had not come here; by this time surely she would have

found something else and all would have been well.
"Well, it's very nice to see you again, Lady in the Moon," said

Raygan. "Do you like this place better than Nadine's?"
"There's more variety," replied Win.
"Not homesick yet for our side of the water—what?"
"I haven't time to think about it," she fibbed. "Now I must say

good-bye. We're coming to the ground floor."
"Let's go along with her, Miss Rolls, and see her home," suggested

Rags. "I want to know whether the blouse department beats that

Monarchic room with all the mirrors—what?"
Ena's face showed distress. Her eyes actually appealed to the cause of

it to save her, and Win was only too ready to respond.
"Please don't come," she protested earnestly. "It wouldn't do. It's

against the rules to talk to—to any one you know, except on business.

I'm new here still, and I'm sure you wouldn't want to get me into

trouble. I'd much rather go alone, though it's very nice of you to

offer. Good-bye!"
The lift had at last reached the ground floor, and all Win had to do

was to let herself be borne out on a warm tide of females. Ena pressed

her body against the wall, and Lord Raygan must, perforce, stand by

her.
"Good-bye!" she cried. "We have to go up again, you know."
"We'll sail by, anyhow, and see where you hang out later," Raygan

called after the disappearing form in black. "And we'll bring Rolls

and my sister."
By this time the elevator had emptied itself, save for those bound for

the basement and Ena and Rags. It was impossible for Win to forbid the

party to "sail by," or to make any answer at all, over the decorated

heads of many women. But she felt as if she would rather die than have

Peter Rolls see her working in his father's store. He might easily

think that she had taken a place there because of knowing him, and

that, regretting the snub delivered at parting, she had hoped he might

some day find her in the Hands.
"I just can't bear it," she said to herself. "I'll have to pretend to

be ill, and get permission from Mr. Thorpe to leave the floor

again—to go to the hospital room—anything to get away."
But—wouldn't that be like the ostrich hiding its head in the sand?

Evidently Lord Raygan and Lady Eileen were being shown things. If they

hadn't been there already they would be sure to take a peep into the

hospital as well as the rest room. Not the restaurant perhaps! If Mr.

Rolls junior and his sister had any idea what that was like, they

would avoid it with their distinguished guests. Still, even there one

would not be safe. The only sure escape would be to go home, and she

would have to look very ill indeed before she could obtain leave of

absence for the rest of the day.
Wondering what on earth was to be done, Win suddenly recalled the

look in Ena Rolls's eyes, which had said as plainly as spoken words:

"For heaven's sake get me out of this scrape, and do or say something

to put Lord Raygan off dragging me with him to your horrid old blouse

department."
"She won't let them come!" Win told herself. "Somehow she'll prevent

it. I'll stick to my guns."
So she went back to her place as if nothing had happened and returned

to Mr. Thorpe the permit he, as aisle manager, had given her to leave

her duties and go off the floor on which they were carried out. It was

a small paper slip signed by him, and Thorpe would have been

responsible had she outstayed the time asked for. But she was safely

within it, and she had herself well enough in hand, after her

adventure, to answer his kind, sad smile with gratitude.
"What will Miss Rolls do to stop Lord Raygan from wanting to come—and

from saying anything about me to the others?" she wondered. She could

not guess. Yet she grew more and more confident of Ena's finesse as

the long afternoon wore on.
What Miss Rolls did was very simple, if you had the clue. But the clue

was what Win lacked.
"I thought we were due to meet Eily and Rolls about this time, and

look at those wonderful pearls your father says he gets straight from

the fisheries," Rags reminded Ena when the elevator dropped to the

basement and began to bound up again.
"So we are," she admitted, "but there's something I must tell you

before we see Petro. That's why I made the excuse about getting

out—only, of course, you didn't understand. You couldn't! Any floor

will do, really—but we'll think of the one likely to be the least

crowded. I can't explain if creatures are pushing us about. Oh,

'Upholstery and Furniture!' They'll do."
The two wormed their way out of the lift, which was becoming more

congested at each stopping place, the legitimate hour for luncheon now

being over. The floor chosen by Ena had a series of "Ideal Rooms,"

furnished according to periods, and she led Raygan into a Dutch

dining-room with a high-backed settle which, if they sat down upon it,

would screen them from passers-by outside the open, welcoming door.

Besides, the old oak made a becoming background for a blue velvet

dress and silvery ermine stole.
"It's about that girl I want to speak," she said, when she had enticed

Lord Raygan into this secluded retreat.
"Who, the Lady in the Moon?" He was staring at delft plates on

panelled walls.
"Yes. I wished for a minute she'd been the Lady in Jericho. Perhaps

you noticed that I didn't seem overwhelmed with joy at sight of her?"
"Well, it did occur to me that you might have been more enthusiastic

if she'd been a Miss Vanderbilt."
"It wasn't that at all," Ena assured him eagerly, almost piteously.

"I didn't mind having to speak to her because she's a shop girl, but

because I was afraid if we stopped and talked, my brother might come

along. I wouldn't have had that happen for anything."
"Why on earth not?"
"I can't tell you, Lord Raygan. Please don't ask me. You'll embarrass

me very much if you do. But will you just trust me that it would be a

very bad thing if they were to meet, and not insist on our going to

look her up at the waist counter or wherever she is?"
"Certainly I won't insist," said Rags. "I don't care, you know,

whether we look her up or not. Only she was Rolls's chum on the

Monarchic, and I thought if he––"
"Dear Lord Raygan, please don't think about it any more. And if you

want to be very kind, and make me real happy and comfortable, don't

tell Petro we met the girl—or even mention her. You will promise

not, won't you?"
"Of course, if you ask me, that's enough," said Rags, looking rather

sulky. He was curious to know what she actually meant, but, of course,

could not ask, and somehow the whole affair—Ena's deep solemnity and

secrecy, her hints which mustn't be questioned, began to seem silly

and even rather repulsive. He had never liked her less.
Vaguely conscious that she was not "making a hit," and more than ever

angry with the hateful necessity for this excursion, which was to

blame for everything, Ena rambled on, "hoping he wouldn't

misunderstand," and floundering into half explanations which made the

situation less comfortable every minute. At last, when the subject was

torn to tatters, and Raygan had begun to betray impatience, she got up

to go.
"Petro and Lady Eileen will be waiting for us in the jewellery

department now, I expect," Ena said drearily. "Let's hurry and meet

them, and then we can get away. I'm bored to death with the stuffy old

place, and you must be, too. I can't bear anything commercial. If

there's a lovely concert or a tango tea somewhere to finish up the

afternoon, it will be nice. Or almost anything!"
There was a tango tea, and it was nice. Rags, however was far from

nice. He did not seem at all himself.
"I'm afraid the poor old store wasn't as much fun as you thought it

would be," said Petro, half apologetically, when he began to realize

that Rags had a "grouch." Petro had liked the plan to visit the Hands,

and had liked the visit, too. The place had seemed a beehive of

industry and the bees—selling bees and buying bees—had all looked

happy and prosperous enough. On the surface, dad's methods appeared to

be the right methods. But Peter wondered if it would be a betrayal of

his promise if he wandered through the store alone sometimes, when it

was less crowded and things more normal. He had surrendered his

conviction that he "ought to help," and as Peter senior had stipulated

for no interference if Peter junior truly trusted him, one must be

careful about interpretations.
Petro's ideas for a "Start in Life Fund" were occupying a great deal

of his attention and were crystallizing into concrete form. He hoped

that he might soon cease to be a drone, and end by being of some real

use in the world. But as Peter junior passed out of the shop, his

promise to keep "hands off the Hands" seemed one of the things to

regret, whether selfishly or otherwise. He would have liked to know

more of the place, so passionately interesting to him, apart from its

business side; and he was unable to understand how Raygan, the one

whose curiosity had drawn all four to the Hands that day, could have

managed to be bored.
"Blouses" pulsed with excitement. Miss Ena Rolls and her brother were

said to be "showing their father's shop to an English lord." How the

thrilling tale began to go the rounds nobody in "Blouses" could tell.

But whenever any famous personage—a millionaire's daughter or an

actress, a society beauty or the heroine of a fashionable

scandal—enters a big department store, the news of her advent runs

from counter to counter like wildfire. In some shops the appearance of

an Astor, a Vanderbilt, or a Princess Patricia would send up the

mercury of excitement forty degrees higher than that of a Miss or Mr.

Rolls. But at the Hands, Peter the Great's son and daughter would have

drawn all eyes from the reigning Czar and Czarina of Russia.
It was rumoured that they had lunched early in the Pompeian

restaurant. The waitress who had served them had not known until too

late. She would regret this all her life. Mr. Michaels, of

"Jewellery," who had been honoured by showing them pearls, was envied

by all his fellows, and the same with Miss Dick, of "Candy," and Miss

Wallace, in "Perfume." Girls in all departments grew quite jumpy in

expectation that the party might appear, and under the intense nervous

strain of trying to recognize them in time.
"Rubberneck!" one hissed to another, and giggled if she made her

start.
Even Miss Stein, now somewhat resigned to fate and looking more kindly

at Fred Thorpe, became condescending and communicative in the general

flurry.
"Keep your eyes peeled for a good-looking, short guyl in blue velvet,

with an ermine muff and stole that's a beaut from Beautville," she

said to Win. "Thorpe saw her. He's had her pointed out to him at the

theayter, so he knows. Her brother's dark and thin, but blue eyed. I

saw in the Sunday supplement he's goin' to marry the sister of that

lord."

There was a dinner at Sea Gull Manor that night in honour of the

Rolls's guests, and just as Eileen had finished dressing, her brother

Raygan knocked at her door.
"Want me to say your tie's all right?" she chirped.
"No, my child, I do not," said Rags. "I wouldn't trust your taste

round the corner with a tie. You're looking rather pleased with

yourself—what?"
"I'm pleased with myself and everybody else," replied Eileen. "This is

one of my happy nights."
"I wonder why? There's sure to be a dull crowd at dinner. I've found

out now the Rollses know all the wrong lot."
"I found that out long ago. But I don't care. And I'm going to sit

by Petro. So I shall be all right."
"You've jolly well been with him the whole blessed day. Aren't you

sick of his society yet?"
"No. And I shouldn't be till doomsday. He talks to me of such

interesting things."
"Has he ever by chance said anything to you about the Lady in the

Moon?"
"Good gracious! no, nor the man either. Nor the green cheese it's made

of. Is that the sort of conversation Ena's been treating you to? If it

is, no wonder you look bored stiff. You never could stand romance from

any one but darling Pobbles."
"Don't speak of Kathleen in this house. It makes me want to bolt for

home. Not that she'd look at me if I did. But the contrast between

her and Ena Rolls—good Lord, it doesn't bear thinking of! Nothing

doing about the Lady in the Moon so far as I'm concerned. It's Rolls

who got moonstruck—according to his sister. Now can you guess whom I

mean?"
Eileen's pleasant, plain little face flushed up.
"Oh, the Nadine girl on the ship! The one who looked so nice in the

Moon dress. Petro bought it—for Ena. And she gave it to that

fascinating girl. She—Ena, I mean—told me all about it."
"And about the girl, too?"
"What was there to tell?"
"Blamed if I know. But Ena was hinting dark things this afternoon.

That's why I was wondering whether he'd opened out to you. You're such

pals."
Eileen shook her head. She was not looking quite so bright as when

Rags had first come into the overheated, overlighted, overdecorated

room. But perhaps this was only because he had set her to thinking

intently. "No, he's never spoken of the Lady in the Moon. Let me

think—what was her name?"
"Miss Child."
"You seem to remember very well—you, who mix up all the wrong names

with the right faces."
"But I saw her to-day. I forgot—I haven't told you of that yet, have

I?"
"No. Where was it?"
"Wait a minute. Strictly speaking, I oughtn't to tell you, I suppose.

All the same I will—for a reason—if you'll promise first not to

mention it to Rolls. Never mind why not, but promise, if you want to

know."
"Of course I want to know. You make me fearfully curious. I'll

promise not to breathe a word to Petro."
"Where the girl is or anything about her?"
"'Where the girl is, or anything about her.' Honour bright. Is that

enough? Well, then—go on!"
"She's in the shop—employed there, it seems. We met her in the lift,

Ena and I. It was a surprise all round. Ena wasn't overjoyed. No more

was the Lady in the Moon. They got rid of each other quickly and

skilfully. Afterward, Ena buttonholed me and sat me down on a hard

settee in a beastly furnished room like a rathskeller, with price tags

on everything, and made me solemnly swear not to split to Rolls."
"About your meeting Miss Child?"
"Ra-ther! And all the rest of it."
"What rest?"
"A lot of rubbish. I don't know what she was driving at, I'm hanged if

I do. But if I didn't like Rolls, I'd suspect."
"But you do like him. And so do I."
"I've noticed that. So would Mubs, if she ever noticed anything that

didn't wave suffragette colours."
"And I shall go on liking him—'right straight on,' as he'd say

himself. Nothing that Ena or anybody else could tell me would make me

believe a word against him. And the girl's nice, too. I'm sure she is.

But how too endlessly quaint she should be in the shop."
"She intimated politely, when we asked her questions, that it was a

last resort."
"I should think so, indeed! She was—well, not a beauty exactly, but

too weirdly fascinating."
"She hasn't changed. Only she looked scared at the sight of us. And

she's thinner in the face. Her eyes seemed to have grown too big for

it. Ena said Petro mustn't find out where she is. Rather rum—what?"
"Is this the thing that's made you so grumpy ever since?"
"I don't know that I've been grumpy. Only a bit reflective. The fact

is––"
"What?"
"Never mind. It wouldn't sound very nice."
"Who cares how it sounds? You might tell me, now we've got so far."
"Well, then, sometimes I wonder whether—the game's worth the candle.

Whatever the rotten old proverb means!"
Eileen had no difficulty in understanding the allusion.
"She's got heaps of good things about her," the girl reminded him,

being as loyal as was humanly possible to her hostess.
"Heaps. They're simply piled up in the corners of her nature. But I

seemed to have wandered into an empty place to-day. By Jove, Eily, I

thought I'd made up my mind. I'm fond of the old place at home, and

I'd like, to see it done up properly. It isn't as if I'd ever care

tuppence again about any girl on earth after—Kathleen. So what does

anything of that sort matter? At least that's what I've been asking

myself."
"I'm afraid Ena thinks you'll soon be asking her."
"Heavens! I suppose she does. Not that I've said a confounded word.

I'm hanged if I know what to do! I tell you what. I'll wait and see

how things go to-night. And then—maybe I'll toss up a penny."
"We ought to go down now, anyhow," said Eileen, still very

thoughtful.
"Come along, then, and face the music."
"You go. I'll follow in a minute. I want to put this wonderful pink

orchid in just the right place in my dress, and I shall be nervous if

you watch me."
"What a ripper! Where did you get it?" Rags pretended that he cared to

know the history of a wonderful, live-looking flower that lay on his

sister's dressing-table.
"Petro. He bought it for me in the florist department of his father's

shop. He said it was the latest addition—the department, not the

orchid."
"Don't you get thinking too much about Rolls," grumbled Lord Raygan.

"There may be something in that affair, after all. One can never be

sure. Anyhow, I thought I'd tell you."
On that he closed the door, shutting himself out.
"Petro—and the Lady in the Moon," Eileen whispered, just above her

breath, as she found the right place for the orchid.
 
 
CHAPTER XVI
THE SEED ENA PLANTED
Ena was glad when she saw Eileen wearing the orchid that Petro had

bought for her in the gorgeous new department at the Hands. Rags had

at the same time purchased some gardenias for Miss Rolls, she having

mentioned that the gardenia was her favourite flower. Both girls

tucked these trophies into the front of their coats, and wore them

home. Also, they wore them again for dinner, a far more conspicuous

compliment to the givers. Ena meant it to be taken as such, and

faintly hoped, in spite of the afternoon's failure, that the thing she

prayed for might happen that night. Perhaps Lord Raygan needed a

little more encouragement, for, after all, she was rich and he was

poor, and men did hesitate about proposing to heiresses—in novels.
Nothing did happen; but there was still time, for the guests were

staying on for a cotillon, and there was a meeting at which Lady

Raygan had faithfully promised to speak. It was a shame, however, that

the effect of the orchid as well as the gardenias should be wasted,

and the morning after their visit to the Hands, Ena made an

opportunity of speaking to Petro alone.
He was in his own "den," one of the smallest rooms in the house, meant

for a dressing-room, and opening off his bedroom. He had fitted it up

as a nondescript lair, and indulged in ribald mirth if Ena tried to

dignify it with the name of "study." All the pictures of the big

animals he hadn't killed were there—beautiful wild things he felt he

had the right to know socially, as he had never harmed them or their

most distant relatives. In an old glass-fronted, secretary bookcase of

mahogany, the first piece of "parlour furniture" his parents had ever

bought, were the dear books of Petro's boyhood and early youth, and

above, on the gray-papered wall, hung a portrait of mother, which her

son had had painted by an unfashionable artist as a "birthday present

from his affectionate self" at the age of sixteen. An ancient easy

chair and a queer old sofa still had the original, slippery, black

horsehair off which Petro and Ena had slid as children. Petro had

named the sofa "the whale," and the squat chair "the seal." Both

shiny, slippery, black things really did resemble sea monsters, and

had never lost for Petro their mysterious personality.
There were some cushions and a fire screen, the bead-and-wool flowers

of which mother had worked in early married life, and on the floor, in

front of the friendly wood fire which Petro loved, lay a rug which was

also her handiwork It was made of dresses her children had worn when

they were very, very little, and some of her own which Petro could

even now remember. Nobody save he, at Sea Gull Manor, cared for a

grate fire; or if mother would have liked one, instead of a

handwrought bronze radiator half hidden in the wall, she dared not say

so. But she came and sat in Petro's den sometimes, crocheting in the

old easy chair, when he was self indulgent enough to have a fire of

ships' logs. The rose and gold and violet flames of the driftwood lit

up for him the secret way to Dreamland and the country of Romance.

What it did for mother, she did not say; but as her fingers moved,

regularly as the ticking of a clock, her eyes would wander over the

old furniture she had loved and back to the fire, as if she were

trying to call up her own past and her son's future.
This morning Petro was not in a good mood, for he had been reading in

the newspaper an interview with him which he hadn't given. It was all

about the "Start in Life Fund," and sounded as if he were boasting,

not only of the idea, but of the way in which he meant to carry it

out. Nobody likes to be made to appear a conceited bounder when his

intentions are as modest as those of a hermit crab, and a hundred

times more benevolent.
Therefore, when Ena came, using as an excuse a dire need of notepaper,

and stopped to dawdle, lighting one of his cigarettes, Petro felt an

urgent desire to be cross. She had on some perfume which he hated, and

a split skirt, and was altogether so inconvenient and uncongenial that

disagreeable things to say sat on the end of his tongue. He bit them

back, however, for he knew he should be sorry afterward if he were a

beast.
"You look as if you'd like to snap my head off," said Ena, fumbling

among his cigarettes.
"So I would. But I won't," said he. "It isn't you I mind. It's only

something that Raygan would call bally rot in the paper."
"Something about us?" Ena was alert in a moment.
"Only about me."
"Is that all! You're so silly about having things in the paper!

Almost anything's better than nothing, I feel, as long as they don't

go raking up father's and mother's past. Oh, I know you think their

past's the best thing about them. Let's not argue. Does it say again

that you're engaged to Eileen?"
"No, thank heaven. I don't want to punch heads in her defence."
His sister laughed, and tried to make herself comfortable by putting

her feet up on the slippery whale. The split green cloth skirt fell

apart and showed a pink ankle clad in a tight-fitting film of green

silk stocking. Ena gazed at it appreciatively and liked the look of

her foot in a high-heeled green suède shoe with a gold buckle.
"My private opinion is that dear little Eileen was tickled to death by

the mistake. The only thing she didn't like about it was—its being

a mistake."
"If you talk like that, I'll wish the whale was Jonah's," said Petro.
"She does love you!" Ena got out hurriedly, fearing to be stopped, or

caught up in the surprisingly strong arms of Petro, and gently set

down on the wrong side of the door. "She does! She does! I've thought

so a long time. Now I know it. I mustn't tell you how."
"You oughtn't to tell me how. It isn't true and it isn't kind—to

either of us. I hate hearing such darned nonsense about a girl who

likes me as a friend. And she'd be mad as the dickens if she could

hear."
"Perhaps she'd be mad," Ena admitted, "because it is true. If it

weren't she'd only laugh. You're a simple Simon not to see. Everybody

else with eyes does see. And they'll all be sorry for her if you don't

speak."
"Any one would think I was a dog and she was a bone," growled Petro.

"Speak, indeed! I wish you'd mind your own business, Ena."
"I am minding it as hard as I can," said his sister, "and you ought to

thank me for taking an interest in yours, too. Don't you like poor

little Lady Eileen?"
"Very much; same way she likes me. We're good chums."
"If you don't believe what I say, Petro, there's a splendid way of

finding out. Ask her."
"See here, my dear girl, haven't you got anything better to do this

morning than to loll all over my sofa and talk drivel when I want to

write a letter blowing up somebody? I felt a fool when you came in.

Now you've made me feel a double-dyed idiot. Kindly go away and dig a

hole in the ground with yourself."
Ena went. But she felt that, despite discouragement, she had already

dug a tiny, tiny hole in very hard ground, not for herself, but for a

little seed which might perhaps send out its shoots later.
It did not precisely do that; but as the ground raked over was Petro's

heart, the seed his sister had left made him uncomfortable. It burned

and stung and felt alive, and something had to be done about it.
Of course Ena was wrong. He was the last fellow in the world a girl

could care for. He had learned that to his sorrow. A girl couldn't

even like him. There was something about him that bored her nearly to

death as soon as she began to know him fairly well, and made her want

to bolt. He was as sure, he told himself, of the exact nature of nice

little Lady Eileen's feeling for him as of his for her. Nevertheless,

that night at a dance, when he and she (for the best of reasons, they

didn't know how) were sitting out the tango, he found himself becoming

confidential.
This was strange, for Petro had one of his father's characteristics if

no other—he did not confide things in people. Peter senior kept his

own secrets because it was wise to keep them. Peter junior kept his

partly because he thought they would bore every one save himself. So

even where the two were alike, they were miles apart. For some vague

reason, however—which, if he had stopped to define it, would have

convinced him that he was disgustingly conceited—Petro was moved that

night, in a new-fashioned conservatory resembling a jungle, to tell

Lady Eileen one or two things about himself.
How it started he was not quite sure, but with some awkwardness he had

tried to lead up to the subject, and suddenly Eileen had begun to help

him out.
"I used to think a man would have to know a lot about a girl," he

said, "before he could be sure she was the sort he could fall in love

with. I thought love at first sight wouldn't be love at all, but only

infatuation. Now I see that I didn't know what I was talking about. It

isn't a question of whether you could love her. You've just got to.

You can't do anything else. It's like seven devils or seven angels

entering into and possessing you. There they are before you know

what's happened. Afterward, when you find out what's struck you, maybe

it's too late. Or maybe there'd never have been any hope, anyhow."
"'While there's life, there's hope,'" quoted Eileen.
"But what if life's parted you from her?"
"I wouldn't let it, if I were a man. I wouldn't allow the girl to go

out of my life. It doesn't sound a strong thing to do."
"It might be, though, in some circumstances. For instance, if a girl

showed you very plainly she couldn't be bothered with you, it would be

weak to run after her, wouldn't it?"
"I wonder," said Eileen, "if a man's a good judge of why a girl does

things that she does? Of course, I don't know much. But I feel he

mightn't be. It's so difficult for girls and men to understand each

other, really. Now there's my brother Rags and our cousin Pobbles—I

mean, Portia. Pobbles is her nickname. You know we're great on the

most endlessly quaint nicknames in our family. She's quite a distant

cousin of ours, otherwise she wouldn't have such lots of money as she

has. We're church mice. We'd be church worms if there were any! But

Rags was in love with Pobbles for years, and she wouldn't believe it.

She thought, because she's not exactly pretty, it must be her money he

wanted. They never understood each other a bit. You mustn't say

anything about this, and I won't say anything about what you tell

me. You will tell me about the girl, won't you? Maybe I can help.

You see, though I don't know so very much about men yet—except

Rags—I know a whole lot about girls."
"There isn't much to tell," said Petro. "I met a girl in rather a

queer way—sort of romantic, it seemed to me. And the minute I saw her

she stood out quite different from any one else I'd ever seen, like a

red rose in a garden of pale-pink ones. I couldn't get her face out of

my mind, or her voice out of my ears. She was like my idea of a dryad.

It seemed she might turn into a tree if a man looked at her too long.

But I didn't know I was in love. I thought she just appealed to me,

fascinated me somehow or other. And I wanted to do things for her all

the time. I was always thinking of some excuse to be where she was. I

was looking forward to doing a lot more things—I suppose it was only

selfishness, because I wanted to make her like me, but I didn't

realize that till after she was gone."
"Gone?" Eileen encouraged him.
"Yes. She didn't want me to do those things I'd been planning for her.

She wouldn't have what I could do, or me, at any price."
"Did you—had you—told her you cared?"
"Great Scott! no. I hadn't got nearly so far as that. I told her I

hoped to see her again, that if there was something I could do to

help, I—but she wasn't taking any. She seemed friendly and kind

before that, which made it worse when she turned me down so hard. I

suppose she hadn't minded much at first, but the more she saw of me

the more she couldn't stand for the shape of my nose or the way I

talked, maybe. She just got to feel that the sight of me hanging

around would poison New York for her, and she intimated that her

health would be better if I kept at the other end of the city. You

wouldn't have had me continue to butt in, would you?"
"I don't know. What happened then?"
"Oh, she went away."
"You let her go?"
"What else could I do?"
"You could have found out where she went in case she changed her mind.

But perhaps you did find out?"
"No. For she didn't seem like the kind of girl who would change her

mind about a kind of fellow like me. Besides, I was sort of stunned by

the difference in her manner just at the moment. When I came to

myself—I mean, about wondering if I could have done anything better,

and realizing what a terrible lot I cared, she was gone. Then I hoped

Ena would hear from her. I think she promised to write. But it appears

that she never did so."
"Is she in New York still?"
"I wish to heaven I knew!"
"Couldn't you find out?"
"I might, if I wanted to be a cad."
"Why—what do you mean?"
"I dare say a private detective would undertake the job. Sometimes

I've been tempted—yet no, I don't believe I ever did come near to

playing the game as low down as that."
"But it might be for her good––"
"That's the way I argued with myself. I almost got myself convinced

sometimes. But I knew in my heart it was only sophistry. You see, it

isn't as if she would let me do anything for her, even if she wanted

anything done, which I've no particular reason to suppose she does.

She's English, and a stranger over here, but she told me—when we were

friends—that she had letters of introduction to good people and that

she'd plenty of money till they found her a job. I can't bear to think

of her needing a 'job' when I—but I'm helpless! No doubt she's all

right, and getting along like a house on fire. She was the sort of

girl who would. Or maybe she's engaged by this time to some chap worth

ten of me. But I can't forget. I think of her by day, and I dream of

her by night."
"What do you see her doing in your dreams?" Eileen asked in a new

tone of voice. Not more interested, for she had shown deep interest

before, but with a quaver of excited eagerness.
"Dreams go by contraries, luckily," said Peter, "otherwise I should

worry. I always see her in some kind of trouble. If it isn't one

darned thing it's another. And I look for her by day when I'm up in

town. I think, what if I should see her face framed in some car

window? This afternoon I even looked for her in our store—though

feeling to me the way she did, it would be the last place where

she'd go to spend a cent, if she associated the name of Rolls with

mine. I bet she'd rather go without a cloak on a cold day than buy it

there!"
"Our dance, Lady Eileen," said another man, who had tracked a missing

partner through the tropical jungle.
Eileen rose reluctantly, but graciously, throwing Petro a good-bye

look. There was a sympathetic, understanding smile on her pleasant,

freckled face which seemed to say: "Don't give up. You may find her

yet. And girls do change their minds about men. Anyhow, I'm glad

we've had this talk."
She was glad, though she was sad, too—just a little sad. It would

pass, she knew, for she had not let herself go far. In spite of all

that Ena had said, it had never felt true that Peter cared for her.

She could have loved him, and been happy with him, and have made him

happy, she thought, but since he didn't want her, she must set herself

to work hard not to want him. She must take her mind off the little

deep-down, bruised hurt in her heart by thinking of a way in which she

could make him happy—a way in which, by and by, he might recognize

her handiwork and send her his thanks across the sea.
"I should like him to know I did it," she said to herself. "And then

through all his life he would have to remember me because of his

happiness, which, without me, he might have missed."
Of course, Petro had mentioned no name, and Eileen had asked no

questions. If it had not been for Raygan's revelation she might not

have guessed; but now she did guess, and was almost sure. It seemed to

her that a girl who could have Petro's friendship and then drop it

like a hot chestnut didn't deserve him for a friend, much less a

lover. But there must have been some reason. It wouldn't have been

human nature, to put things on their lowest level, for a girl in Miss

Child's position to "turn down" a young man in Peter Rolls's for a

mere whim.
Could Ena have done something to put them apart? Eileen wondered. It

would—she had to admit—be like Ena. And if Ena had been treacherous

or hateful, then it would be a sort of poetical justice if she lost

Raygan through making her brother lose his dryad. Even now Eileen did

not know what Rags would do; and since their day at the Hands, he had

seemed somehow "off" the affair with Ena. But whatever happened in the

end—which, one way or the other, must come soon—between Ena and

Raygan, Peter mustn't lose the Lady in the Moon because of a stupid

promise exacted and made to get his sister out of some scrape.
Eileen wouldn't break the promise, because a promise was one of the

few things she and her brother Rags had never broken. Raygan wouldn't

release her, even if she begged him to do so, but there might be

another way—a way which might lead Petro straight to the Lady in the

Moon, if he were really in earnest about finding her. That was the

clever part of the inspiration which suddenly came to Eileen that same

night after starting up from a dream which was "endlessly quaint."
"I'll do it when I say good-bye to Mrs. Rolls," she told herself. And

the idea seemed to her so original, so filled with possibilities of

romance, that it was as soothing to the bruise in her heart as an

application of Peter Rolls's Balm of Gilead.
She guessed that he had put aside his reserve and told her about the

"dryad girl" because Ena had put him up to think that she—Eileen—had

"begun to care." The mortifying part was that it had been—almost

true. But Eileen wasn't going to mind. She was going to say to

herself, if ever the pain came back: "If I can do this for him,

surely, when he knows, he'll be glad he told me, and glad that I cared

enough to help."
It was only next morning, when the world showed its practical side,

that she realized how seldom in real life romances can be worked out

to a happy ending—or, at all events, the kind of happy ending the

people concerned are striving after.
"I'll do my best, though," she reiterated, "for Petro's sake and for

mine."
For her the lost dryad was but a shadowy figure in the background,

necessary to the picture, perhaps, yet not of poignant, personal

interest. It was only of Petro she thought.
 
 
CHAPTER XVII
TOYLAND
From her own point of view, the lost dryad was a prominent figure in

the middle of the foreground; for life was strenuous for those in the

grasp of the Hands, and it was only at night, when her body could lie

quiet while her brain was still terribly active, that other figures

assumed their due importance for Win in the great, bright picture of

New York.
It was something to be thankful for that she had escaped Peter the day

of that visit of inspection to the store. Not that she was afraid of

him or anything he could do if they should meet. That would have been

too silly and Victorian! Girls were not like that nowadays, if they

had any sense, no matter how "dangerous" men might be. But she had

liked him so much, and had been so bitterly disappointed to learn from

his own loving sister that he was not the "Mr. Balm of Gilead" created

by her imagination that it would be unbearable to meet him again, to

see him "giving himself away," and thus proving his sister right.
To be sure, after seeing Miss Rolls in the lift, certain kind

protestations of friendship had been contradicted by a frozen smile, a

cold, embarrassed eye. If Peter's sister were insincere in one way,

why not untrustworthy in others? This was one of the questions that

darted into Win's brain at night through one of the holes made there

by the giant bees of the "L" road. But the answer was obvious. Miss

Rolls might be superficial, insincere, and snobbish enough to dislike

claiming acquaintance with a girl of the "working classes," but there

was no motive strong enough to make her traduce her brother's

character. Even untrustworthy people told the truth sometimes.
It was rather fortunate, perhaps, that Win had another exciting

thought to engross her attention at this time, though it was no more

agreeable than the thought of Peter Rolls. After her conversation with

Mr. Meggison, she confidently expected to find her dismissal in the

next pay envelope. It was not there; but, suddenly and without

warning, she was dragged out of Blouses and Neckwear and dumped into

Toys.
This was as great a surprise to Sadie Kirk and Earl Usher as to Win

herself. She dropped upon them as if she had fallen out of the sky—or

at least from the top floor. And nobody knew why: whether it was a

punishment or a reward. For Toys gave harder work for the hands

without a capital H than Blouses and Neckwear, even when Miss Stein

was badly "peeved." Also, Mr. Tobias, the floorwalker concerned with

the toy department was "a spalpeen and a pie-faced mutt from 'way

back," whereas Fred Thorpe was a well-known angel. Yet, on the other

hand, not only were more than half the toy assistants men, but many of

the customers also were men. This made the department more lively to

be in than Blouses, and some girls considered Toys next best to

Gloves.
It was almost like coming into a strange shop when Win arrived with

Sadie before eight o'clock in the morning for her first day in

Toyland, as Earl Usher facetiously named it. The December morning

hardly knew yet that it had been born, and though already there was

life in the Hands—fierce, active life—those pulsing white globes

which made artificial sunshine whatever the weather, had not yet begun

to glow like illuminated snowballs. Shadowy men were lifting pale

shrouds off the counters. Voices chattering in the gloom were like

voices of monkeys in a dusky jungle—a jungle quite unlike that fairy

place where Peter Rolls had talked of Win to Lady Eileen. Out of the

gloom wondrous things emerged to people, a weird world—the Hands'

world of toys.
As Win strained her eyes to see through the dusk, forth from its

depths loomed uncouth, motionless shapes. Almost life-size lions and

Teddy bears, and huge, grinning baboons as big as five-year-old boys,

posed in silent, expressive groups, dangerously near to unprotected

dolls' houses with open fronts—splendid dolls' houses, large enough

for children to enter, and less important dolls' houses, only big

enough for fairies. Dolls' eyes and dolls' dresses and dolls' golden

curls caught what little light there was and drew attention to

themselves.
Some of them stood, three rows deep (the little ones in front, like

children watching a show), on shelves. Others were being fetched out

by the chattering shadows, as if they were favourite chorus girls, to

display their graces on the counters. They were placed in chairs, or

motor cars of doll land, or seated carefully in baby carriages. There

were walking dolls and talking dolls and dolls who could suck real

milk out of real bottles into tin-lined stomachs. Some exquisitely

gowned porcelain Parisiennes, with eyelashes and long hair cut from

the heads of penniless children, were almost as big and as

aristocratic as their potential millionaire mistresses. Humbler

sisters of middle class combined prettiness with cheapness, and had

the satisfaction of showing their own price marks.
These delicate creatures, lovely in pale-tinted robes or forlorn in

chemises, were the bright spots in the vast, dark department, shining

out through the dusk as stars shine through thin clouds. As Win became

one of the band of shadows, under Sadie's direction, gradually she

grew accustomed to the gloom, and her gaze called many of the strange

objects forth into life.
She found long-haired Shetland ponies big enough to ride, glorified

hobby horses clad in real skins, and unglorified ones with nostrils

like those of her landlady in Columbus Avenue. Biscuit-coloured Jersey

cows, which could be milked, gazed mildly into space with expensive

glass eyes. Noah's arks, big enough to be lived in if the animals

would move up, seemed to have been painted with Bakst colours.

Fearsome faces glared from behind the bars of menagerie cages. Donkeys

and Chinese mandarins nodded good-morning and forgot to stop. Dragon

broods of miniature motor cars nested in realistic garages.
Dramatic scenes from real plays were being enacted in dumb show on the

stages of theatres apparently decorated by Rothenstein. The Russian

ballet had stopped in the midst of "Le Spectre de la Rose." Suits of

armour, which Ursus called "pewter raincoats," glimmered in dark

spaces behind piled drums and under limply hanging flags or

aeroplanes ready to take flight. Almost everything was

mechanical—each article warranted to do what it pretended to do in

order to have its appeal for the modern child.
Win was a child of yesterday; yet the big girl has always the little

girl of the past asleep in her heart, ready to wake up on the

slightest encouragement, and she felt the thrill of Toyland. If when

she was small she could ever have dreamed of spending her days in a

place like this, she would have bartered her chance of heaven for

it—heaven as described in her father's sermons. It was another of

life's little ironies that her lot should be cast in a world of toys

when she was too old to prefer it to Paradise.
Sadie and Ursus had used up the little time they had in warning her

what she would have to expect in Toys.
"There are some punk fellers who'll try it on with you—pinch or

tickle you as you pass by, and say things not fit for a dandy guyl

like you to hear," the lion tamer had hurriedly explained. "But don't

you stand for it. You don't have to! Just hand 'em along to me, and

I'll make 'em sorry their fathers ever seen their mothers."
Sadie's story of girl life in Toyland was on the same lines, but with

a different moral.
"Don't you tell tales out o' school, no matter what any of the chaps

do," was her advice. "I kin hold my own, and I bet you can. You may

be a looker, but you ain't anybody's baby doll. If a feller calls you

'childie' or 'sweet lamb' or tells you you're the peacherino in the

peach basket, don't you answer back, but just smile and wend your

ways. If he goes so far as to put his arm around your waist or take a

nip with his nails out of your arm or hip, why, then you can land him

one on the napper if nobody's lookin'. But all the same, the chaps

mostly ain't so black at heart. They just try to decorate their gray

lives a bit, and if those sort of things didn't happen to me once or

twicet a day, why I'd be discouraged and think I'd lost my fatal

beauty."
For some subtle reason, however, "chaps" did not pinch or tickle Win

or slip arms around her waist. One confided to another that he guessed

there was nothing "didding" in that direction, and he'd as soon make

love to the Statue of Liberty as an English Maypole; which was as

well, for from the first moment of her entrance on the scene, the lion

tamer kept his eyes open. There were all sorts and conditions of men

in Toys, but he was among them as a giant among pygmies; and even if

the ex-ship's steward, the ex-trolley driver, the conjurer out of a

job, and the smart young men who had been "clerking since they were in

long pants," had wished to try their luck with Win, Earl Usher would

have shown them the wisdom of turning their eyes elsewhere.
The news soon ran round Toyland that "Winsome Winnie" was Usher's

girl. The male "assistants" did no worse than call her by her

Christian name (they must have caught it from Sadie), and that was no

cause of offence to girl from man in a department store. Every girl in

a department shared by men was "Kitty" or "Winny," "Sadie" or

"Sweetie," while the men expected to be addressed as Mr. Jones or Mr.

Brown, except by their own particular "petsies." Sadie was popular

with all, even the "permanences," who considered themselves above the

"holiday extras." The ex-steward, a good-looking young German, had

offered to get her a dandy place as stewardess when he felt ready to

sniff salt water again, and though she wasn't "taking any," and often

boxed his ears, she made "dates" with him for dance halls after

business hours, especially one called Dreamland, which was too lovely

for "wuyds." There were movies, and you could dance till 'most

morning. Real swell gentlemen, who wore red badges to show "they was

all right," came up and asked if they could "interdooce" other gents

to you, in case you'd come in alone and didn't have friends. But Sadie

always did have friends.
The red-haired girl, who had from the first been a haunting mystery

for Win, was in the toy department. Her name was Lily Leavitt, and—as

Sadie had already told Win—she was "chucking herself" at Earl Usher's

head. At first Miss Leavitt "lamped" Miss Child "something awful." But

on the English girl's third Toy day a thing happened which converted

the enemy into a friend—an all too devoted friend.
It was now so near Christmas that in the department devoted to toys

and games you could not have placed a sheet of foreign notepaper

between mothers (with a sprinkling of aunts and grandmas) unless you

wanted it torn to pieces before you could count "One!" Children were

massed together in a thick, low-growing underbrush, and of their

species only babies were able to rise, like cream, to the top. The

air, or rather the atmosphere (since all the air had been breathed

long ago), was to the nerves what tow is to fire. Nobody could be in

it for ten minutes without wanting to hit somebody else or push

somebody else's child, little brute! out of the way.
What with heat, the rage for buying, impatience to get in and

impatience to get out, the fragrance of pine and holly decorations,

the smell of hot varnish and hot people and cheap furs, the babble of

excited voices and shrieks of exhausted children, it was the true

Christmas spirit. Peter Rolls's store in general, and the toy

department in particular, were having what would be alluded to later

in advertisements as an "unprecedented success."
Before Win came the folding chairs for "assistants" had all been

broken or out of order. But (no doubt, said Sadie) because of some

lingering suspicion that she might, after all, be an anti-sweat spy,

the springs or hinges were mysteriously repaired throughout the

department. By law any girl could sit down. By unwritten law she

mustn't, yet there were the chairs as good as gold and fresh as paint.

They were even pointed out to Win, but in the whirl of things the

moment after she forgot their very existence and never had time to

remember it again.
That third day in Toys was the most appalling she had known of all the

long, wild days at Peter Rolls's since coming in as an extra holiday

hand. Dozens of customers clamoured for her at once. Each female

creature seemed to have as many hands as Briareus, all reaching for

things they wanted, or gesticulating and brandishing money, or

snatching for change. If each distracted girl had had half a dozen

highly trained astral bodies with which to serve these terrible

ladies, it would not have been enough. More ladies would have come.
Yet (Win noticed with wondering admiration) some of the girls, those

most experienced and less easily rattled, did find opportunities to

polish their nails and pat their hair. They would turn as if to find

something "in stock," stoop quickly, taking advantage of the crowd

behind the counters, snatch out of their stockings tiny mirrors and

bags of powder or rouge, and "fix themselves," while their anxious

customers supposed they were diving for a toy. These were the girls

who kept their own perfumed soap and scent bottles in their lockers

and could afford becoming hats, whether or no they had money to buy

new underclothes and stockings when the old ones gave out.
Win, however, had neither experience enough nor desire to find time

for personal matters. She gave her whole soul to her work and wore

that pleasant Christmas smile which floorwalkers wish to see on

salesladies' faces. But her smile was only skin deep. She had never

liked her sister women less—cross, silly, snapping, inconsiderate

things, strutting and pushing about in skins and plumes of animals far

more agreeable and beautiful than themselves! Dangling all over with

poor little heads of dead creatures, just as if they were moving

butcher shops, and apparently without a sense of humour to tell them

what idiots they looked.
Yes, idiots! That was the word. And if they had enough humour to put

on a thumb nail, could they wear the stick-out and stick-up

ornaments on their hats they did wear, to prod each other's eyes? No,

they couldn't! And what with feathers standing straight out behind,

and long corsets down to their knees, they could never lean back

against anything, no matter how tired they were. So, what with tight

dresses and high heels and thin silk stockings and low shoes and

blouses on winter days, no wonder men wouldn't let them have the vote!
Win turned from an incipient suffragette into a temporarily venomous

woman hater when a customer made her show nine dozen dolls, and then

minced away saying that Peter Rolls never did have anything worth

buying. Another patronizingly bestowed five cents upon Win for her

"trouble" after making her change three toys bought yesterday and

taking half an hour over it. Altogether, when Winifred Child happened

to think of Mrs. Belmont's building with the great figure of a woman

falling down the front of it, she would have liked the statue to drop

to earth with a crash.
Once in a while, contriving to pass near, Ursus tried to whisper a

word of encouragement:
"You're a Wonderchild, you are! Say, it don't spoil your looks bein'

tired. You're the picture postal, you are! Never you mind these dames.

Say the word and we'll make up with a large time to-night. I'll blow

you through all the best movies and stake you to an ice-cream, soda.

Do you get yes?"
Despite his well-meant solicitude, however, Win's vitality was at an

exceedingly low ebb toward five o'clock in the afternoon of the third

day. There had been no time to go out for an alleged luncheon and a

breath of fresh air. She had eaten nothing since her breakfast of hot

chocolate at a soda fountain, save a poached egg in the employees'

restaurant, and, as Sadie said, it wasn't safe to accept an egg from

the Hands unless you'd met the hen socially and knew her past. Since

four o'clock the exile had been thinking passionately of England, with

its millions of women sitting down—actually sitting down!—to tea.

And then, suddenly, a man pushed aside a female thing who was being

cross because she couldn't find a doll that said "Papa" and "Mama" in

German.
"As you can't get what you want, madam, I'm sure you won't mind my

taking your place," apologized a cheerful voice. "Madam" was so

dumfounded that she gave way. And Win, thankful for a change of sex in

her customer, had put on her polite saleslady air before she realized

that she was face to face with Jim Logan, her motoring acquaintance of

the park.
"Howdy do?" he inquired, and hastily added: "I want a doll. I don't

care whether she can talk German or not. Though I do want a little

conversation—with somebody."
Money could not be lost to the house of Rolls because one of its

female servants wished to snub an admirer. Mr. Logan was even better

dressed than when Win had seen him before. He looked rich enough to

buy Peter Rolls's star doll, price five hundred dollars, with

trousseau. Nevertheless Miss Child determined to outwit him.
"What kind of a doll?" she asked in a business-like tone, showing no

sign of recognition. "For a small girl or a large girl? And about what

price do you wish to pay?"
"Doll for a middle-sized girl," replied the customer, his twinkling

eyes on the young woman serving him. "I like large girls best, girls

exactly your size and age, twenty at most, and warranted to look

seventeen if given a day's rest and a pretty hat and a supper at

Sherry's—with the right man. I don't mind how much trouble I take

looking for a doll any more than I mind the trouble of looking for a

girl. This is a little sister of mine who has to have a doll. I like

other men's sisters better, but––"
"I think I know just what you want," said Win briskly. "If you'll be

good enough to wait here half a minute; I'll see that you get it."
Like a flash she was off, looking for Sadie. But Sadie was too far

away. Win didn't want the redoubtable Tobias to scold her for

neglecting customers, as she had heard him scold Lily Leavitt the day

before, when Lily was trying to flirt with Earl Usher. Close by was

Miss Lily Leavitt herself, looking bored to the verge of extinction by

an old lady who wished advice in choosing five presents for five

grandchildren. "Miss Leavitt," Win whispered, "would it be possible

for you to take my man, who wants a doll for a middle-aged sister—I

mean, middle-sized—and let me attend to your customer?"
Miss Leavitt threw a green-eyed glance at the man indicated, and said:

"Ginks! Ye-h!" as quickly as she could draw breath.
The immediate and brilliant success of the stratagem was as reviving

to tired Win as the encounter in the park had been. Her splendid

vitality came bubbling to the surface again, and she showed such an

interest in selecting the five grandchildren's presents that the old

lady thanked Providence for the exchange. No time, no trouble, was too

much, and grandma joyously wallowed in layers of toys produced for her

inspection.
Now and then, when the old lady was choosing between an aeroplane and

a train of cars, or a schoolroom and a Noah's ark, Win took an

eyelash-veiled look at Miss Leavitt and her customer. He had

apparently bought one doll, veiled like a harem woman, and was

hesitating over another. The grandmother of five was not the only

person needing advice, it seemed. The brother of one middle-sized

sister was evidently demanding it from Miss Leavitt.
In any case, their heads were close together over a Tango Tea doll who

tried to look as if she had been dressed by Poiret. It stood to reason

that a man might want a woman to tell him whether that was the sort of

thing a middle-sized child would like, but though their heads were

bent over the doll, their eyes turned occasionally toward Miss Child.
"Keep the change and buy yourself and your friends some little thing

for Christmas," Win heard Logan say at last when, discouraged by the

interminable length of grandma's visit, he had resigned himself to go

away.
The girl glanced involuntarily at Miss Leavitt's hand, which was

clenched into a fist. In it was a crisp-looking new greenback on which

at one end she thought she saw the word "Ten."
Ten dollars! The man had made Lily Leavitt a present of ten dollars,

and she had accepted it! Would he have tried to do the same with

her, or would he have attempted to be even more generous if she had

not been chaperoned by the grandmother of five? Also, was it just the

Christmas spirit, or had Lily done something special to earn the

money?
 
 
CHAPTER XVIII
THE BIG BLUFF
Lily Leavitt's gratitude was immense. She was a changed girl from that

moment. Not that she ceased to like Earl Usher, who awkwardly resented

her overtures and was boyishly ashamed of them, but her jealousy

seemed, after the handing over of Mr. Logan, to lose its bitterness.
She no longer glared and talked "at" Miss Child, asking if she "wore

her hair that way for a bet," and "why some people wanted to take up

all the room clerking in stores when they could get better money doing

giantess stunts in a Bowery show?" Instead she did her best to make

friends with Win and her smart little watchdog, Sadie Kirk.
She brought them presents of hothouse fruit and chocolates, which Win

refused and Sadie nonchalantly accepted, wondering "where the Leavitt

creature picked 'em up. They didn't grow on blackberry bushes, no

fear. And she wasn't going to let 'em spoil!"
As the desperate days before Christmas raged furiously on, Win was

still unable to guess Mr. Meggison's real motive for putting her into

the toy department. Her duties were more exhausting than they had been

downstairs That suggested penance. On the other hand, they had more

variety and amusement, for there were five hundred different kinds of

toys to sell to five hundred different types of people. That suggested

benignity.
Perhaps, thought Sadie, Meggison wanted to see how much the new girl

could stand. Perhaps he wished to "sweat out of her" all the work of

which she was capable, the full wage worth she could give to Peter

Rolls before casting her aside forever.
Or—it was just possible that, instead of exciting resentment she had

won his respect by "cheeking" him. That had been known to happen in

the most unexpected, though now historic cases. And girls who had

awaited their discharge had been promoted, mounting slowly higher and

higher over the bodies of those who fell by the wayside, until they

had become head buyers, receiving ten thousand dollars a year and a

trip to Paris every summer.
In any case, Win liked Toys better than Blouses, though Mr. Tobias

(whose hair "left off where it began," and who wore his eyes in bags)

was a very "different proposition" from Fred Thorpe, the kind and

handsome floorwalker who loved Dora Stein, yet was fair to her rivals.

If Tobias saw a young woman stop to breathe he came up and reminded

her that this wasn't a matinée—they weren't having a party that day

nor serving five-o'clock tea.
The girls, too, were often rough in their ways and pushed each other

rudely about. They were surlily suspicious sometimes and seemed

temperamentally unable to trust one another, but they were

good-natured at heart. "Snap and let snap" was the unwritten law in

Toyland, and though they all squabbled among themselves, if a girl

were ill or had bad news her companions were ready in an instant to

help or console.
They mimicked Win and gave her the same nickname she had gained

downstairs, "Miss Thank-you," "Beg-your-pardon," and "If-you-please."

But soon she found herself popular, and saw the girls, and even the

men, adopting the gentler ways she brought among them. They seemed

half unconsciously to fall into the soft manner they made fun of,

which was a score for Win. Besides, there was Cupid, and he alone, she

thought, would have been worth the move from Blouses into Toys.
Cupid was an errand boy, employed to run with messages from one

department to another; but, though in Toyland there were some dolls

larger, there were none more beautiful than he. His real name happened

to be Billy Slate, but he rejoiced in several others more appropriate

such as "Bud," "Christmas Card," and "Valentine" That of "Cupid" was

added to the list by Miss Child, who had more scientific, mythological

knowledge of the youth in question than any one else at the Hands

perhaps, though most of the others could boast a more intimate

personal acquaintance with him in modern life.
Billy, alias "Bud," et cetera, was a permanent fixture at Peter

Rolls's, having been in his present position for some time and

possessing no ambition to better it, though he had reached the mature

age of "twelve, going on thirteen." He had resisted the blandishments

of all the prettiest girls in the store, but for some reason fell a

victim to Miss Child at first sight; perhaps because she was English

(his parents came from Manchester), or perhaps because she treated

him, not like a little boy, but like a man and an equal. He adored

her promptly and passionately, and she responded, out of which arose a

situation.
Cupid sometimes received presents of violets or Malmaison pinks from

admiring customers, gifts which he spurned with the weary scorn of a

matinée idol for love letters, but had been willing to barter for sums

varying from one cent to five, according to the freshness of the

flowers. When Win drifted into his life, however, all tribute which

Cupid received was laid upon her altar. He would take no money—her

smiling thanks were worth more to him than the brightest copper coins

from others—and an offer of candy was politely but firmly refused.
"Pooh! Miss Child, I can get all of that stuff I want, on my face, off

the girls in the candy dep," he explained with a blasé air. "You keep

it for you and your friends, and I'll get you more. I'm tired of sweet

things myself."
And from that time on Win's attenuated meals were eked out by Cupid's

presentation chocolates and marshmallows. Of the latter—a novelty to

her—she and Sadie were very fond. They seemed nourishing, too, or, at

all events, "filling," and came in handy when you had allotted

yourself only five cents for luncheon. As soon as Cupid learned his

loved one's penchant for marshmallows he contrived to produce a few

each day, even if he had to "nick" them when the "candy girls" weren't

looking.
The morning of Christmas Eve (the day which, Win knew, would decide

her fate at the Hands) Cupid appeared with a whole box of her

favourites instead of the five or six crushed white shapes he

generally offered in a torn bit of clean paper.
"Why, Cupid, how did you come by this gorgeousness?" asked Win, who

had half a minute to spare in the luncheon lull.
"Don't you worry and get a wrinkle, kid," replied the youth, who had

permission to apply any pet name he pleased. "The stuff's mine, all

right. And now it's yours. Unless you think I sneaked it. Then you can

chuck it away, box and all. See?"
"Of course I don't think you sneaked it. You wouldn't do such a thing.

But—ought I to take it? That's the question."
"'It's foolish question 786245,'" quoted Cupid with his weariest

sneer. "I'm the guy what put the nut in cokernut! I guess there'll be

more where this come from in the sweet by and by."
Win eyed him anxiously. Now where had she heard that quotation about

the "foolish question?" Why, it was a slang phrase of Mr. Logan's. He

had used it only that morning, about half an hour earlier, in gay,

bantering conversation with Miss Leavitt. He "blew in," as he called

it, nearly every day now to buy something more for his "little

sister's Christmas tree," something that he had forgotten yesterday,

or to inquire earnestly after the sale of a mechanical frog, which he

claimed as his own invention and patent. He had never succeeded in

getting Win to serve him, but he was as free to look at her as a cat

is free to look at a king.
Apart, however, from telling glances which Miss Child never seemed to

see, Mr. Logan appeared quite satisfied with the attentions of Miss

Leavitt or Sadie Kirk, who had waited upon him once or twice when Lily

was not available.
Suddenly an idea flashed into Winifred's head.
"Did a man give you this box for me?" she inquired.
"Ain't I man enough?" Cupid tried bluff to hide a flush that mounted

to his yellow curls.
"Answer me. You must."
"Ain't you some chicken to go on askin' silly questions about a good

thing? You just take it, kid, and be thankful"
"I can't, Cupid. I thought you liked me."
"You bet I do, sweetie."
"Then you wouldn't want to cheat me about such a thing, would you? I'm

fond of you, Cupid, and we're friends, so I can accept presents from

you. But I don't take them from strange men, and I should hate to

feel you cared little enough for me to play such a joke. It would get

me misunderstood."
Flattered by this appeal to and acceptance of his manhood, Cupid

confessed.
"Well, don't have the nasty old stuff, then," said he. "I thought I

was doin' you a good turn. Thought gells liked strange men makin' 'em

presents. The feller said 'twould be good business for you as well as

me. And he tipped me fifty cents to pass you on the box. Suppose I

must hand it back to him now."
"Do, Cupid dear," urged Win. "But you shan't lose by that. I know you

meant no harm, and I'll give you fifty cents myself when I get my

pay."
"What kind of a jay do you take me for?" snorted Cupid. "Men don't

accept no lucre from ladies where I live. I'll go chuck the guy back

his marshmallers and his dirty money, since you put it that way, my

baby doll."
"Where is he? Waiting for you somewhere to hear the news?"
Cupid tossed his curls in the direction of the moving staircase, which

in Toyland was known as the "Oscillator." A bored-looking youth was

stationed officially at the top in order to catch any ascending lady

who might threaten to fall; but as only the oldest and frailest ever

did so, his bored expression had become chronic.
"Chap's down at the foot o' that," confessed the boy. "But say, won't

you just look and see if there's a note under the cover? Maybe he's

slipped in a Christmas gift of a hundred-dollar bill or a diamond

tiarey."
"I've no curiosity," said Win. "You may tell your friend that,

and––"
"Oh, I know! Tell him he'd darned better not try the same snap

again."
"Yes," laughed Win. "Exactly."
Cupid darted away with the box, striding down the "osculator" as it

came rolling up, a feat forbidden. But the boy was a law unto himself

and was seldom scolded. When he had gone Win wished that she had

thought to ask how the man had found out her liking for marshmallows

But perhaps he had invited a suggestion from Cupid. Or the

marshmallows might be a coincidence.
She did not for an instant doubt that the would-be giver was Mr.

Logan, and she half hoped there was a note inside the box, in order

that he might feel the mortification of getting it back unopened. She

hoped, also, that the disappointment might be a lesson which Mr. Logan

would take to heart, and—unless he were prepared to transfer his

attentions to Miss Leavitt or some one else equally ready to receive

them—that he would not again invade the busy land of toys.
An hour later, however, he returned and loitered about, ostentatiously

waiting until Miss Leavitt should be free to serve him. Win was

showing dolls to a fussy woman who could not be satisfied with the

most beguiling porcelain or waxen smile. At last, having looked at

several dozens, she flounced away, announcing that she would go to

Bimgel's. This threat, being uttered in a voice intentionally shrill,

was overheard by the hovering floorwalker, Mr. Tobias.
He had never yet had occasion to scold No. 2884; and, as a matter of

fact, had noted her as a "lively proposition." He had seen that if

2884 had a few minutes to spare, she usually occupied them, not in

polishing her nails or talking about last night's dance, as not a few

of the girls did, but in "looking over stock," peeping into boxes, and

peering into the background of shelves in order to see for herself

what was available without having to question salespeople who had been

longer in the department than she.
This was the sure sign of a "winner"; and besides, 2884 had the right

way with customers. She kept her temper, even with the most irritating

"lemons." Her charming enthusiasm about the toys and her knowledge of

their mechanism (when they had any) often hypnotized customers into

buying expensive things they had not intended to take. With remarkable

quickness she had picked up slang danger signals by which one

"assistant" can warn another of impending trouble.
She understood the warning cry of "ishra ankra" for a "crank," and

could give the pencil taps telegraphing from counter to counter that a

notorious "pill" or an "I'll-come-back-again" was bearing down on the

department. She seemed to know by instinct when she could offer to

send a toy C.O.D. for a stranger without fear of "cold pig"—having

the thing returned unpaid—and she could give enough of her own

vitality to a tired woman to make her want to buy.
All these virtues Mr. Tobias had discerned in 2884, and with such

heart as he had, he admired her. He intended, if she went on as she

had begun, to "set the good word going" which would reach those "at

the top." But now, at a moment when he happened through acute

indigestion to be in a particularly fretful mood, he believed that he

had found out the "bright girl" in a grave fault.
It was too late to inveigle the lost client back, but while Win was

hastily replacing dolls in boxes before taking another customer, Mr.

Tobias pounced. "Why did you let that lady go without showing her any

of our best dolls?" he inquired, angling for guilt in her soul's

depths with a fishhook glare.
"I showed her everything of the price she wanted, and even some a

little higher," 2884 excused herself.
"What about the doll you all call 'Little Sister?'" Tobias threw out

the question as if it were a lasso. "I hear you've said that you won't

part with that one if you can help it."
Win grew pink, though she firmly gave him back look for look. Little

Sister was her favourite doll, and it was an open secret that Miss

Child didn't wish to sell it unless she could be sure of finding it a

suitable and happy home. In fact, she hated the thought of a sale.

Many Teddy bears and other interesting personalities she had learned

to like, and to miss when they went the way of all good Teddy animals;

but Little Sister she loved, and to barter that adorable sunny head,

those laughing brown eyes and dimples, for money seemed almost as bad

as the auctioning of a child in the slave market. If she had had

twenty dollars to play with she would have bought the doll for

herself. As it was, she had to plead guilty to Mr. Tobias's charge.
She changed her look of self-defence to one more deprecating yet half

mischievous; not the look of a scolded girl to an accusing

floorwalker, but that of charming young womanhood to man.
"I'm so sorry," she said. "I didn't forget; but I felt sure that lady

wouldn't spend twenty dollars for a doll. And I know I can find a

better—I mean, I know I can get some one to buy it."
"I'll buy it," said Mr. Logan, stepping up.
This time he had safely caught his tantalizing rainbow trout, which

had not a chance even to wriggle. There was 2884 without an excuse in

the shape of another customer, and there was Tobias, with whom, on the

strength of the alleged "invention," Mr. Jim Logan had already scraped

acquaintance.
The eyes of the girl and the man met. Logan saw that Miss Child had

already guessed what he meant to do, or that she thought she had. But

he believed that he had a card up his sleeve whose presence even her

sharp wit had not detected. He looked forward joyously to the scene

about to begin.
"Get the doll I spoke of and show it to this gentleman," commanded

Mr. Tobias, lingering to see that he was obeyed, for there was that in

the flushed face of 2884 which told him she was capable of a trick.
Little Sister lived in a large, open-fronted box lined with blue silk

and fluffy lace, in a desirable but not too conspicuous (Win had seen

to that!) corner of a shelf devoted entirely to dollhood. There she

stood now, the sweet, smiling child, the image of the ideal

two-year-old baby which every girl would like to have for her own

"when I'm married."
In reaching up her hands to take down the box Win hesitated. Next but

one was another doll, not unlike Little Sister to the casual eye,

especially the casual eye of a mere man. Its dress was also white; its

hair was of much the same gold, though not quite so radiant; its eyes

were as brown, if more beady; and it was larger, more elaborately

gowned, therefore more expensive. If Mr. Tobias recognized the

difference, would he not praise rather than blame the saleswoman,

since instructions were to force high-priced articles on customers

whenever possible?
Win darted a cornerwise glance at Tobias to see if he were

suspiciously watching her. He was, with the expression of a cloud

about to emit a flash of forked lightning. Little Sister must be

sacrificed!
Just then, as Win reluctantly placed the box on the counter for

Logan's twinkling inspection, Cupid went by on one of the endless

errands which, as he said, "kept him jerking up and down all day like

a churn." He knew Little Sister, for had not his beloved "Kid" ruffled

his feelings by remarking on a likeness between her pet doll and

himself? Infra dig as was the comparison, he had forgiven it when

the Kid explained her affection for the type. Now that Fresh Guy who

had nearly "got him disliked" for fifty cents was going to buy the

doll!
Cupid "spotted" the trick at once and saw its cleverness. The boy

"made big eyes" at Win as he stumped past, and wondered whether she

"was fly enough to catch on" to what he wanted them to say.
She was not. At that moment, when she found herself outwitted by

Logan, Cupid's big hazel eyes and yellow head seemed irrelevant.
"The price is twenty dollars," she announced mechanically. These were

the first words she had uttered to Logan since passing him on to Miss

Leavitt the day of his first appearance in Toyland.
"That's all right," said her smiling customer. "Rather cheap for such

a handsome doll, isn't it? I think the young person I intend to give

it to will be pleased, don't you?"
"I can't say, I'm sure," returned Miss Child with aggravating

primness, her eyes cast down.
"Why, you might give me your advice!"
The glare of Mr. Tobias was turned upon her again, like a two-dollar

electric torch.
"It's quite one of our prettiest dolls," she admitted under the

searchlight.
"Good! I'm glad you think so. Well, here's the money, all in small

bills, I'm afraid. Would you mind just counting it over? I've got on

my gloves."
She had to take the money from him, which gave him a chance to touch

her hand, and he made the most of it. If Mr. Tobias saw what was

going on, he ignored it tactfully, for the great thing was to keep a

good customer at any price. If the price were a flirtation, why all

the better for the girl, provided the man were chump enough to give

her a good restaurant dinner now and then. Peter Rolls had to think of

his dividends, since he and his manager were not in business for their

health, and to make them satisfactory salesfolk had to be got cheap.

It was "up to" the girls to take care of themselves. What they did out

of business hours, Peter Rolls and Mr. Tobias did not care and didn't

want to know.
No. 2884 required the address, which Mr. Logan seemed eager to give.
"Write clearly, please," he gayly commanded. "Miss—Winifred—Child.

And now the number of the house. I know it as well as my own."
"I can't accept this," she said, not taken by surprise, because she

had been sure all along of what he meant. Only it came as a slight

shock that he should have found out her whole name and the street and

house where she lived.
"But see here," argued Logan, still in the low tone to which both

voices had fallen, "I bought the doll for you when I heard you liked

it. Why not? No harm in taking a doll from a friend."
"You're not a friend," she broke in.
"I want to be. What will that floorwalker chap say if Little Sister is

thrown back on Peter Rolls's hands? It might get you into trouble."
"I can't help that," Win was beginning desperately, when Earl Usher

came hurrying up from the other end of the department, where he had

been selling automatic toy pistols.
"Excuse me, Miss Child," said he briskly, "but that doll is sold. I

ought to have marked it, but forgot. My fault. While you was away to

lunch it happened. The purchaser is going to look in to-night, between

six and six-thirty, to pay and take the parcel away."
Mr. Tobias, hearing this announcement, came bustling into closer

earshot again.
"Very remiss—very remiss not to have marked the doll as sold," he

sputtered. "I don't think we can let the deal stand. This gentleman

has offered to purchase in good faith, and here's his money. Your

customer may as like as not go back on the bargain."
"He won't," said Ursus firmly. "It's a man. He's often here doing

business. He'll be awful mad, and we'll lose him certain sure if we

throw him down like that. I'll be responsible."
"You!" sneered Tobias, impressed nevertheless. "Why, you ain't more

than a ten-dollar man, if you're that. This doll costs twenty

dollars."
"I know, and I don't pretend to have saved up a million. But this

mix-up is my fault, and the man was my customer, so I ought to stand

the racket. Look here," and he proudly drew forth from some inner

pocket on his enormous chest a handsome gold watch destitute of a

chain. "Presentation," he announced. "You can see my name and the

date. I've hocked this more'n once and got forty. Will you keep it

till my customer turns up?"
"No," returned Tobias magnanimously. "If you're so sure of your man, I

guess it's all right, and the sale'll have to stand. I'm sorry, Mr.

Logan. But you see how it is. Can't one of our young ladies show you

something else?"
"No, thank you, not to-day," said Logan, his long, sallow face red and

the twinkle gone out of his eyes. "It was Little Sister or nothing for

me."
But though he gathered up his mass of greenbacks and stalked away with

his smart hat on the back of his incredibly sleek head, Tobias was not

greatly worried. The young swell was sweet on Child, and wasn't above

a flirtation with red-haired Leavitt at the same time he was trying to

spoon the English girl. He would come back, and soon—no fear!—to see

how his invention was going.
"Lordy! but that was a big bluff I put up!" sighed Earl Usher to

Cupid, as he slid his watch into the little boy's hand. "If Tobias had

taken me, I'd 'a' bin up a tree! Sure you can get off, sonny?"
"Dead sure, for they'll be sendin' me out. They always do. I'll manage

the biz for you."
"Good Bud! You get a quarter for yourself, see?—for puttin' me on to

the job in time."
Mr. Tobias happened to be at a distance when Usher's customer came in

and paid. But when the floorwalker inquired, at

six-thirty—characteristically remembering a small detail in the

terrible Christmas rush—the transaction had been completed and Little

Sister was gone. Even Win had not seen the purchaser. Ursus had come

in a hurry, his client's twenty dollars in hand, and had taken away

the box that contained the doll. There had not even been time to ask

if the man who had bought it looked kind and rich; but Win was too

thankful to have been saved from her "scrape" with Logan to care

passionately, after all, for Little Sister's fate.
That night, a few minutes before ten o'clock, the employees of the

various sections were lined up (men in one aisle, girls in another) to

receive their pay envelopes and, in most cases where the "holiday

extras" were concerned, their dismissals. Just in front of Winifred

Child was Sadie Kirk, and Win knew that for her friend it was a

question almost as important as that of life and death whether she

were to stay or go.
After holiday time it was dreadfully difficult to get work, she not

being the stuff of which stewardesses are made, and Sadie had more

pluck than physical strength. Never had she entirely recovered "tone"

after that attack of grippe which had lost her a good position, and

the strenuous work during these weeks at Peter Rolls's had pulled her

down. If she were to be "out of a job" things would be very bad for

her; yet, as she moved up slowly, step by step, to the desk of

destiny, she was reading a novel, calmly straining her eyes in the

trying light. Over her shoulder Win could see the name of the book,

"Leslie Norwood's Wife." Page after page Sadie turned, not with a

nervous flutter, but with the regularity which meant concentration.

She was bent on finding out what happened to Leslie Norwood's wife

before the moment came to find out what was about to happen to Sadie

Kirk.
She was near the end now. But was she near enough? Win began, in her

nervous fatigue and anxiety on her own account, to wager with herself

as to whether Sadie would finish that book before her turn came to

take the fateful envelope. Would she? Would she not? "I bet she

will!" Win thought. "If she does, it'll mean luck for us both!"
And she did. Just as the girl ahead of Sadie clasped her pay envelope

with a slightly trembling hand, Sadie read the last word on the last

page, shut the volume, and tucked it under her arm. Then she took her

envelope and gave place to Win.
They were among the few lucky ones out of the extra two thousand. Most

of the others received with their pay little printed slips signed

"Peter Rolls," announcing that it was "necessary to readjust our force

down to the normal at this time." Those dismissed were politely

informed that their record was on file. Should vacancies occur where

they might be placed in future, they would be "notified to that

effect." Meanwhile they were thanked for loyal service. And—that was

the end of them as far as Peter Rolls was concerned.
He still had use, however, for Winifred Child, Sadie Kirk, Earl Usher,

and two or three other "live" workers in Toyland. They compared notes

joyously; but despite her sense of relief, Win's heart was heavy for

those left out in the cold. The girls who were disappointed hurried

away in silence, but many of the men whom No. 2884 had not thought of

as friends, scarcely as acquaintances, came up to say good-bye. They

held out their hands and remarked that they were "glad to have known

her."
Some of her ways and some of her sayings were pretty good, they

guessed, and they wouldn't forget her, although they didn't suppose

that they'd ever meet again. Suddenly Win realized that they had been

kind and pleasant, so far as it had lain in their power, and she,

staying on, would miss the faces that were gone. She choked a little

over these men's appreciation of the difference between her "ways" and

those of some other girls, and was half ashamed that it should

surprise her.
"I expect I'll have to take to the sea again," sighed the ex-steward.

"I wanted a little more time on land, but it ain't to be. Don't

forget, you and your friend Sadie, that I can get you jobs on one of

the big greyhounds."
"What a Christmas Eve!" Win said to herself aloud, as she almost fell

into her room at eleven-thirty. "In half an hour more it will be

Christmas, and I don't suppose there's one soul with a thought for me

in all Europe or America!"
But on the ugly red cover (warranted not to betray dirt) of the

rickety bed were two parcels—a big box and a little one. Somebody

must have been thinking of her, after all!
Revived, she cut the strings on both boxes and opened the little one

first, on the childlike principle of "saving the best thing for the

last."
"Lilies of the valley! Why, how lovely! Who could have sent them?"

There was no name, and a question asked itself in Win's mind that

spoiled all her pleasure—but only for a moment. She unwrapped the big

box, and on the cover (which looked curiously familiar) she read,

evidently scrawled in furious haste, with pencil: "From Ursus to

Lygia, with respectful regards and wishes for a merry Christmas. Also

please accept lilies."
(Miss Leavitt had testified her admiration for the blond giant by

sending him a box of her name flowers, bought with some of the

"change" Mr. Logan had told her to keep. The admired one had promptly

"passed them on." But Win did not know this, and he didn't see why she

ever should. Anyhow, flowers were flowers!)
The girl was so pleased to know that the lilies came from Ursus, not

another, that she could almost have kissed them—but not quite. Then,

in her relief, she lifted the cover of the large box and gave a cry

which was not unlike a sob. There, in silk and lace, with eyes closed

and smiling lips, lay Little Sister.
"Oh, his watch—his presentation watch!" she gurgled. And sitting on

the bed, with the great doll in her arms, she let fall on the

unresponsive head a few tears of grief and gratitude. She understood

everything now, even the "big bluff."
What had been or had not been in Miss Leavitt's pay envelope Win did

not know until the morning after Christmas, that strangest Christmas

of her life, which she spent resting quietly in bed. Returning next

day to Toyland, where everything looked half asleep in the early

gloom, she saw the glitter of red hair.
"Hello!" said Miss Leavitt. "Here we are again! Did you have a

merry––"
She stopped short, her eyes fastened on a tiny spray of pearly bells

half hidden in the folds of the other's black silk blouse. For an

instant she forgot what she had meant to say, gasped slightly, closed

her lips, opened them as if to speak, shut her teeth together with a

snap, swallowed heavily, and went on where she had broken

off—"Christmas?"
Win thanked her, said "Yes," and asked politely how Miss Leavitt had

spent her holiday. This gave the girl with red hair time to control

the temper which accompanied it. But if, in that brief interval of

uncertainty, she had burst out with the fierce insult which burned her

tongue, never again could she have ventured to claim friendship with

Winifred Child. And if she had lost her right to claim it, all the

future might have been different for one of them.
 
 
CHAPTER XIX
"YES" TO ANYTHING
At last it was July, and New York felt like a vast hermetically sealed

Turkish bath into which all were free to enter, but once in, must

remain, as there were no exits and no closing hours. Most of the

people you read about in the Sunday supplements (except those who

commit murders and such things) had escaped to the sea or mountains

before the Turkish bath opened for the summer. But there is never

anything in Sunday supplements about the assistants in department

stores, for they are fashionable only in restricted districts, and

they do not commit murders and such things, though they might

occasionally enjoy doing so.
It had been, said the newspapers, an exceptionally gay winter and

spring. Seldom had there been so many beautiful and important

débutantes. Lovely girls and admiring men had decorated each page of

the calendar, like rose petals. There had been cup races for

automobiles, and football and baseball matches for men and girls, and

other matches less noisy but almost as emotional. There had been

dinners and balls, first nights at the opera, Washington's Birthday

week-end house parties in the Adirondacks, and Easter church parades

for those who had not gone abroad or to Florida. Among those who chose

Florida (there had been a great deal about this in the Sunday

supplements) were Miss Rolls and her brother. Ena had collapsed under

an alleged attack of grippe after Lord Raygan went away and his

engagement with Portia (alias "Pobbles") Gregory—the rich Miss

Gregory—was announced. Some people were mean enough to say that it

was not grippe but grief which laid Ena low in the height of the

season; and if there was anything in this gossip, the grief would have

been greater had Miss Rolls known that she herself was (indirectly)

responsible for the happy ending of Raygan's romance.
A letter written by Lady Eileen while at Sea Gull Manor to her cousin

Pobbles had (so Pobbles confessed later) suddenly opened the lady's

eyes to her own true feelings. She began to wonder if Rags had loved

her "for herself," after all. And, anyhow, she didn't want a girl like

Ena Rolls to get him. So she met the ship on which Lady Raygan, Rags,

and Eileen returned to Ireland, in order to "make a dead set" at the

man she had once discarded. An engagement was the consequence, and in

the first letter Rags wrote to thank his kind host and hostess on Long

Island, he asked for congratulations.
It was the same day that Ena began to sneeze so dismally that the only

place for her was bed. And when she could leave its seclusion the next

only place was Palm Beach. She said she would die unless she could go

to Palm Beach, so mother took her, and Peter took them both, not to

speak of Ena's maid.
He did not wish to play courier. To turn his back on New York

interfered seriously with his plans and half plans and hopes and half

hopes. But father would not go, and mother and Ena could not without

a man. Peter was the only one available at the moment, and it was

April when Ena felt well enough to face the North again. By this time

the news of her engagement to the Marchese di Rivoli had been copied

from all the principal papers into the little papers, and even the

most confirmed cats must be acknowledging far and near that to lose an

earl and gain a marquis is a step up in life.
It was, of course, not ideal that the Marchese di Rivoli had no

remaining family estates of which his fiancée could talk, and there

were creatures ready to swear not only that he had come to Palm Beach

to pick up an heiress, but that the penniless princess who introduced

him to Miss Rolls had received a commission. Still there are always

family estates in the market, and where a coronet is there is gossip

also. Only the cat tribe start or believe it, and even cats purr to a

marchesa, lest they may want to visit Italy next year.
In the Turkish bath which was New York that July, Peter Rolls's

department store was one of the hot rooms. Miss Rolls did not come

over from Long Island to choose her trousseau there, as a badly

informed newspaper announced that she would do. She went to London and

Paris instead, because it was cooler as well as smarter to put the

Atlantic between her and "New York with the lid off." She ran over

with the divorced Italian princess who had made her acquainted with

the Marchese di Rivoli, and mother and Peter were released.
No doubt other big stores were as hot or hotter than Peter Rolls's

that July; but it seemed to Winifred Child that the Tropic of Cancer

might have breezes which the Hands missed. Those of the salespeople

who did not look as if at any moment their eyes might come out and all

their veins burst, were living advertisements for Somebody's

Anti-Anemia Mixture before the mixture was taken. Win was of the

latter type. She had become so pale and thin that Sadie Kirk compared

her to a celery stalk. Sadie herself had, according to her own

criticism, "shrunk and faded in the wash," but the two girls had now

few chances of "passing remarks" on each other's appearance, for,

though Sadie was still in Toys, Win had been put into Mantles.
This in itself was a solution of the Meggison mystery. The girl's

"cheek" had frightened the would-be "dog" and reminded him that a

model superintendent must never lose a born saleswoman. But he had not

sent for Win again, and Gloves were not for such as she.
Sadie, having "sauced" her landlady, found it wise to change her

quarters. She had taken a room in an apartment house two blocks

removed from her former home, and Win, not being able to afford a

"flit," remained at the old address. At first, when her pay was

increased by two dollars a week, she had intended to save and follow

Sadie. One had, however, to live mostly on ice-cream soda in the hot

weather, which cost money. Besides, even had she possessed the

dollars, she lacked energy of late. It was easier to keep on doing

what one had done than do anything new. And, in any case, nothing that

one did seemed to matter.
As for the lion tamer, Peter Rolls's shop saw him no more. He had "got

his nerve back" and had returned to lion taming, not because the old

life drew him irresistibly, but because there was far more money in

dominating real lions than in selling Teddy ones.
In the birth of Earl Usher's adoring love for Win the demise of the

animal who had "died on him" was forgotten. "Nerve" and courage and

love and the desire to conquer were one in his heart. When a "good

summer job at Coney" came his way, through an old friend in the "show

business," he took it.
Reluctant as he was to leave Peter Rolls, which meant leaving "his

girl," a change of position offered the only hope of obtaining her in

the end. And despite every discouragement from his Lygia, Ursus did

secretly cherish this hope. As she no longer lived in Toyland when he

went, the wrench of parting was not what it would have been to leave

her at the mercy of any man who could afford to buy a doll. There was

no excuse for men to "butt into" Mantles, unless accompanied by female

belongings, and thus accompanied, their sting was gone.
At Coney Island Ursus was earning thirty dollars a week instead of

ten, and was encouraged by crowds of admiring girls (who watched his

performance and bought his photographs) to consider himself

exceedingly eligible on that income. Many indeed made it plain to him

that he would have been worth taking for his face, his muscles, and

his spangled tights alone.
Sometimes on Sundays Sadie Kirk persuaded Win to "go to Coney for a

blow." The crowd on the boats was alarming and on the beach when you

got there, but the air was splendid, and poor Ursus beamed over his

lions' heads with pride and pleasure. These few excursions, however,

had been Winifred's only outings, except a play or two seen from a

gallery, since she came to make her fortune in America; and as each

day the heat pressed more heavily upon her with its leaden weight, she

felt that she would collapse and "do something stupid" if she could

not have a change. Anything—anything at all that was different and

would break the monotony!
Lily Leavitt, who was in the Mantles, too, had never ceased to be

friendly, and had often invited Win to go out with her in the long

summer evenings, but always in vain, month after month, until one day

in mid-July, when the heat wave had surged to its record height. It

just chanced—if there be such a thing as chance—to happen on the day

when the girl's craving for a change had become an obsession, almost

an illness.
It was a little past noon, and the seniors in Mantles had gone out to

lunch. They were rather by way of being aristocrats, these seniors,

for the mantle department, Jewellery, and some others worked "on

commission." Salaries were no larger than elsewhere, but a handsome

percentage was paid on sales; and those tigers and tigresses who were

strong and ferocious enough to grab meat from under their weaker

comrades' noses did extremely well. The Mantles girls who had gone out

were champion tigresses. They could afford to eat at something like

real restaurants, and as there was nothing worth rushing back for,

they would not return until the last moment.
Lily Leavitt, who was qualifying as a tigress, had just snatched a

sale which ought to have been Win's, but that did not count in their

private relations. It was business, and Win was "welcome to play the

same game"—if she could. Only, there was no danger that she would.

Win was not of the stuff from which tigresses are made, and was

incapable of seizing for herself anything—be it a seat in the subway

or the chance to sell a mantle—which some other human creature was

striving to get.
Win bore Lily no grudge for having "bagged" her customer and gained in

three minutes three dollars which should rightfully have found their

way to her purse. She listened without resentment to the description

of a hat which Lily intended to buy with the money—a "sticker" it had

proved in Hats, and was now marked down to half price. Lily had had an

eye on it for some time, and would, of course, get it "ten per." off.
"I bought me a sweet party dress last week—a bargain," Miss Leavitt

went on, seeing that Win had no intention of "slanging" her for what

she had just done. "It came outta commission on that green chiffon

evening cloak and that white yachtin' I snapped off Kit Vance when she

was daydreamin' and let me catch onto her customer like you done just

now. Things is down to no price this hot weather. It's an ill wind

blows no one good, and now is us guyls' time to get a bit of our own.

P.R. always manages to make his hay, rain or shine. And even with our

ten per. off, it's forty per. profit for him. When you think there's

two thousand folks forced to buy on the premises, you savvy what he

squeezes outta us! If we do pick up a bargain, it's a rare chance. I

wonder you don't hustle more'n you do and make enough com to buy

yourself sumpin' nice. Your sheryt waists are the wuyst in the dep, if

you don't mind my sayin' so, and the guyls speak of it. Now if you had

a party dress to doll up in, I could give you the time of your life

to-night."
"Could you?" echoed Win, more in the desire to turn Miss Leavitt's

attention from her "shirt waist" to something else than because she

wished to hear about the great opportunity.
Miss Leavitt had offered her numerous opportunities of alleged

entertainment, none of which, though glowingly described, had ever

tempted her to acceptance. At first she had been afraid of Lily's

fruit and chocolates and theatre tickets, which, like the

marshmallows, might have come from Mr. Logan. But for the last three

or four months, since the two girls migrated together into Mantles,

Logan had been conspicuously absent. Apparently he had not invented a

cloak as well as a toy! Win no longer connected Lily Leavitt's

occasional invitations with him. Her refusals were prompted merely by

a disinclination for Lily's society out of business hours and the

conviction that her friends would be no more congenial than herself.

Winifred now, however, particularly wished to show her companion that

she bore no animosity for the filched commission, therefore she became

loquacious.
"I don't need to spend my hard-earned dollars on a party dress, as it

happens," she said. "I can save all my pennies for the hire of my

typewriter, which is going to lead me from the Hands some day along

the road to fortune. I've got the most gorgeous gown you can possibly

imagine. I don't believe Cinderella's godmother could give her

anything better. There's only one trouble. I shall never be invited to

a party good enough for it."
"I've invited you to as swell a party as there could be in little old

New York," boasted Miss Leavitt. "I ain't foolin'. That's straight.

Honour bright, cross my heart."
"Oh, but you didn't invite me. You said you would if I had a dress.

You've got only my word for that," Win reminded her.
"I meant to invite you all the same, dress or no dress," Lily

confessed, "I'd o' lent you one. Have you really got something swell?

If you have, now's your chance to show it off. It's an artist gives

this party. I sit to artists sometimes, Sundays, for my hair. I guess

you offen seen it on covers o' magazines. This artist friend o' mine's

the best o' the whole bunch."
"Man or woman?" Win wanted to know.
She expected the answer to be "man," but Lily did not seem to hear.

Her face looked dreamy.
"It's the loveliest house where the party'll be," she said. "'Tain't

the artist's own. It's some relation's that's lent it for the summer

while they're away at the seashore. I bin there. It's in the Fifties,

just off Fift' Av'noo. Tonight it'll be cool as snow, and

everything'll be iced for supper. Iced consummay, chicken salad cold

as the refrigerator, iced champagne cup flowin' like water; ice-cream

and strawb'ries, the big, sweet, red ones from up north, where they

keep on growin' all summer, and lilies and roses from the country to

give away to us when we go home."
Win forgot the question that had not been answered. She seemed to see

those strawberries and to smell the sweetness of roses and lilies in a

house "as cool as snow."
"Heavenly!" she sighed. "I didn't remember there were such things in

the world!"
"Well, come with me to-night and remind yourself," coaxed Miss

Leavitt. "You needn't be afraid, because I said it was artists, to

butt into some rowdy crowd. They'll be as quiet and refined as mice.

They're more your kind than mine, I guess."
"But who invites me?" Win made another bid for information.
"My artist friend said I could bring any one I wanted to bring, and I

want to bring you. I don't just know who all'll be there, but I guess

not many, and it's a real swell house to see. You always refuse

everything I ask you to, but I do think you might say yes this one

time and show you're not proud and stuck up. It'd do you good!"
"I believe it would, and I'll go!" cried Win. She was in the mood to

say "yes" to anything.
"Hully gee! That's the best thing's happened to me since the measles!"

exclaimed Miss Leavitt jovially. "I'll call for you at your place

half-past nine this evening, so you can have a good rest before you

begin fixin' yourself up."
"It's an engagement," said Win, with a kind of self-defiance.
She had wished for a change, "anything for a change," and presto! her

wish had been suddenly granted by fate. Rather spitefully granted, it

would seem, because to go to a "party" with Lily Leavitt was the very

last thing she would have chosen. And spitefully, also, as if to

punish her own foolishness in wishing, she accepted such goods as the

gods had mischievously provided.
"You've said yes, and now you must stick to it," she told herself in

preparation for a wave of regret, but to her surprise the day wore on

and the expected tide of repentance did not set in.
The girl realized that she was looking forward, actually looking

forward to the evening. It would be like walking wide awake into the

Hall of Dreams to put on a dress beautiful enough for a princess, and

eat ice-cream and big red strawberries in a house "cool as snow"

instead of sitting in her hot bedroom practising on the hired

typewriter or panting on her bed, dead to everything in the world

except a palm-leaf fan.
When she had been a little girl, invited to children's parties, it had

not been of the slightest importance whether she liked the child or

not. The party was the thing. Now history was repeating itself in her

nature. The blank monotony of life and work had given back that

childish eagerness for fun, no matter whence it came. She did not care

whose ice-cream and strawberries she was going to eat, provided she

got them and they were good. Besides, it would be like finding an old

lost friend to look into her mirror (it was cracked and turned one's

complexion pale green, with iridescent spots; but that was a detail)

and see a bare-necked, white-armed girl in evening dress.
There was a new way of doing the hair which Win had noticed on a

smiling wax beauty in Peter Rolls's Window-World and had dimly wished

to try for herself. Only dimly, because if her hair were glossy and

trim it suited those plain, ninety-eight-cent shirt waists better than

the elaborate fashions affected by Lily Leavitt and one or two of the

more successful tigresses who cheaply copied expensive customers. Now

there was an incentive for the experiment and Win laughed at the

eagerness with which she looked forward to the moment of making it,

laughed patronizingly, as she might have laughed at a child's longing

for Christmas.
"Anyhow, it's something that I can laugh," she thought, recalling,

as she often did, her boast to Peter Rolls, Jr. "And I haven't cried

yet!"
She had not guessed how vividly the sight of the Moon dress and

putting it on would bring Mr. Balm of Gilead to her mind. But as she

stood gazing into the greenish glass, with her hair very successfully

done in the new way and the Moon gown shimmering night-blue and

silver, it was as if Peter Rolls came and looked over her shoulder,

their eyes meeting in the mirror.
Yes, she saw him for an instant as clearly as that. He was there. He

was her friend, the nicest, most altogether delightful man she had

ever seen; the one she knew best and needed most, though their actual

acquaintanceship was but a few days old. The kind blue eyes were true

and brave, and said: "I dare you not to believe in me, as I believe in

you!"
Then the vision (it had almost amounted to that) was gone like a

broken bubble. Win felt physically sick, as if the one thing worth

having in the world had been shown her for a second, then suddenly

snatched away forever.
The silvery sheen and the faint, lingering perfume of that Nadine

model gown had woven a magic carpet of moonbeams and transported her

back to the mirrored room on the Monarchic for an instant. But it

was only for an instant. Then the Columbus Avenue bedroom, with its

window open to the roar and rush of the "L," had her again, and made

the Moon dress and the Moon-dress dreams seem ridiculously unsuited to

life.
Win touched a switch which shut off light from the one unshaded

electric bulb hanging like a lambent pear over her head. Then,

palm-leaf fan in hand, she sat down in the blue summer darkness to

await the coming of Miss Leavitt.
For the first time she repented her promise to go out. Monotony was

preferable to the party as she pictured it—a silly, giggling crowd of

crude young people among whom she, the stranger, would be like a muted

note on a cheap piano. Should she stay at home, after all, and tell

Lily that the heat had made her too limp to stir? It would be quite

true. But no. If she stayed she would not have the courage to undress

for a long, long time. She would just sit there in the dark by the

window in the Moon gown, its perfume surrounding her with the past,

shutting her up, as it were, in the mirror room with Mr. Balm of

Gilead who had never really existed.
Yet, had he not? What had the eyes in the cracked glass said just now?

Why shouldn't she believe them instead of Ena Rolls's dreadful hints?

Why might not a sister, even with the best intentions, be mistaken

about a brother?
These were exactly the sort of questions that were upsetting and

altogether useless to ask one's self, and Win jumped up to turn on the

electric light again. She would go with Lily Leavitt!
Five minutes later a taxicab—a real, live, magnificent, unthinkably

expensive taxicab—stopped and chortled in front of the apartment

house in which Mrs. McFarrell's flat was one of many. Heads flew out

of windows, for the thing was unbelievable, and among other heads was

Win's.
Instinct cried that the chortling was for her. The balcony where the

rubber plants had died and mummied themselves, being scarcely more

than a foot wide, she was able to see a face, crowned with red hair

and white as a Pierrette's in the lights of the street, looking

anxiously up from the cab window. Its expression implored the guest to

hurry down, because each heart-throb meant not a drop of red blood,

but several red cents. Win caught the message, and seizing the ancient

though still respectable evening cloak which had spent months in a

trunk with the "New Moon," she flew downstairs.
"What an extravagant creature!" she gasped, breathless when after a

wasted sixty seconds at most the taxi was en route.
"I had a present from a gentleman friend," said Lily in a

self-satisfied voice, adding hastily, in deference to Miss Child's

"stuck-up primness," "a filopena present, to choose myself anything I

liked with. I thought us bein' in party dress, and you sort o' tired

out, a taxi'd be just about the best thing goin'."
This reduced Win to the necessity for gratitude, and after months of

the "L," the subway, and the crosstown car, the girl could not help

revelling in a taxi. She refused to be depressed by the gloomy

spectacle of lower-class New York in the throes of a heat wave—pallid

people hanging out of windows or standing at corners to be eased of

their torture by the merciful spray from fire hydrants; barefooted

half-naked children staring thirstily at soda fountains in bright, hot

drug stores they could never hope to enter—every one limp, lethargic,

glistening unhealthily with horrid moisture, all loathing themselves

and indifferent to each other. Sometimes Win felt that these were her

true brothers and sisters, the only ones who could understand, because

they were the only ones who really suffered; but to-night she dared

not think of them. If she did, because of what they endured she could

not enjoy the ice-cream and strawberries in the snow coolness of the

artist's borrowed house.
New York not being her own city, its different divisions lacked for

her the meaning and importance they had for those at home; therefore

she was disappointingly calm when Lily made the taxi stop in front of

a house only three or four doors off Fifth Avenue. Miss Leavitt had

the fare ready, with a small tip for the driver, and the two were out

of the cab, standing in the street, before Win noticed a thing that

struck her sharply and quickly as being very strange.
"Why!" she exclaimed, "we must have come to the wrong place. All these

houses are shut. Their doors and windows are boarded up!"
 
 
CHAPTER XX
THE CLOSED HOUSE
"It's all right," said Lily. "Don't you remember I told you the house

was lent to my artist friend by the folks who own it and who've gone

away for the summer to the seashore? The front door and windows were

boarded up, I guess, like they always are, before the house was lent.

My friend lives in the back part, and the caretaker looks after

everything, but it's awful nice. You needn't be afraid you're goin' to

waste your grand dress. Say, it's some swell street, ain't it?"
Lily talked fast and slid an arm through Win's in the thin silk kimono

cloak, encouraging her to mount the steps. But Win objected to being

hustled. She paused to look up at the house front which—like all its

neighbours except a big, lighted building at the corner, that had the

air of being a club—had apparently been put to sleep for the summer

months.
The dark-brown façades were expressionless as the faces of mummies.

Smooth boards had been neatly fitted into the window frames and made

to cover front doors. There seemed at first glance to be no way in,

but as Winifred slowly ascended the steps of the fourth house from the

corner, she made out the lines of a little door cut in the boards

which protected the big one. There was no handle to break the smooth,

unpainted surface of wood—old, well-seasoned wood which had evidently

served the same purpose year after year—but there was a small,

inconspicuous keyhole, and into this Miss Leavitt deftly fixed a key

which she took from her hand bag.
"My friend sent me this," she explained, "to save us waiting, 'cause

there's only one servant, and he might be busy. Say, this is real fun,

ain't it?"
"It's—it's quite like a sort of adventure," Win answered "I had no

idea the house would be shut up, or––"
"It'll make it all the cooler," said Lily. She had got the little door

open, and the space between it and the house door it protected could

be seen in the street lights, like a miniature vestibule. "Squeeze in

and feel around till you find the electric bell," she went on. "Some

one'll open the real door, and I can lock up behind us."
"Why lock up?" argued Win, hesitating. "Aren't there others coming?"
"My, yes, unless they're all here. But it wouldn't do to leave a

cover-up door like this standing open. If the police happened along

and saw, they'd think there was something wrong and make my friend a

whole lot of bother."
Win saw the force of this explanation, and stooping to pass through

the low aperture, found herself close to a pretentiously carved

portal. The electric bell revealed itself to groping fingers, and to

her surprise a few seconds after she had touched it, without hearing a

sound, the door opened.
In the dimness of a hall or large vestibule the figure of a man

loomed black against dark gray. Win could see of him only that he was

tall and straight and prim, like a well-trained servant, and his voice

was a servant's voice as he said: "Please be a little careful, miss,

not to trip. We have to keep it rather dark here, but there's plenty

of light inside Let me show you through the hall."
Win thanked him, but turned inside the door to ask: "Aren't you

coming, Miss Leavitt?" (They had never been upon Christian name

terms.)
"Yes, I'm just turning the key," replied Lily. "Go along. I'll

follow."
Win went on through the dusk, dimly seeing panelled walls. She heard

the door shut sharply behind her and supposed that Lily had come in,

but at the same instant another door opened ahead and a soft wave of

rosy light flowed out.
"Walk in, if you please, miss," requested the tall servant standing

attentive, and mechanically Win obeyed.
Lily Leavitt had not exaggerated—this was a "swell house," and "cool

as snow." The room into which she had been ushered was a dining-room,

and at first glance was all one rosy glow—walls, drawn curtains,

thick, mossy carpet, brocade-upholstered furniture, lamps and candle

shades. The table was a shining bunch of lilies in a garden of

deep-red roses seen at sunset, and the glitter of silver and gleam of

glass was a bright sprinkle of dewdrops catching the red western

light.
It was so long since Win had been in a pretty room or had seen a

charmingly decorated table that for a few seconds she lost herself in

the sheer joy of beauty. The sunset-garden simile flashed into her

mind and pleased her. She was glad that she had come. The guests might

be uninteresting, of the Lily Leavitt sort, and the artists might be

so called only by themselves. The room might be over-gorgeous by

daylight, but it was beautiful thus lighted, with a rosy radiance from

above, bringing out the whiteness of damask, the snow purity of

camellias crowding a crystal bowl, and the ruby splendour of

strawberries piled on their own leaves.
What a wonderful sight after months of the Hands restaurant and free

lunches with five-cent chocolate in busy drug stores! Oh, yes, she was

glad she had come, and she must look, look, look at this beautiful

picture, so that she might remember its details and hold it before her

eyes, like a delicately painted transparency, in front of future

realities.
But it was in carrying out this intention, in taking in the details,

that Win's heart suddenly bounded and then missed a beat. The table

had two chairs drawn up to it. It was small and round, and on it only

two places were laid.
Win turned her head and looked for Lily Leavitt. Lily was not there,

neither was the tall, respectable servant. But a smiling man in

evening dress was just coming into the room with the ingratiating air

of one who is a little late for an appointment.
"How do you do, Miss Child?" Jim Logan cordially inquired, holding out

his hand. "This is mighty good of you!"
A thousand thoughts whirled after each other through the girl's head,

like the mechanical horses on a circular toy race course, such as she

had often sold at Peter Rolls's. Round and round they wildly turned

for an instant, then began to slow down.
This house was closed for the summer. The front was boarded up, and

perhaps the back windows also. No lights could be seen, and probably

no sounds heard. Two places only were laid for supper. Lily, then, had

gone—had always meant to go and leave her here, had been bribed to

bring her and go. Oh, but it must have been a big bribe this time, for

surely Lily Leavitt would never dare look her in the face again! One

of them would have to disappear from the mantle department of the

Hands. Was Logan giving Lily enough money to make up for a sacrifice

of all those commissions, or did Lily think that after to-night

she—Winifred Child—would never come back to Peter Rolls's?
As that question asked itself loud bells jangled in Win's head. She

felt as if she were losing her senses. But no, she must not—must not

do that. Never in her life had she so much need to keep them all as

now, in this locked house, where she had no help to hope for save what

her own wits might give, and no one could hear or see what happened to

her except this smiling man and his well-trained servant. For all

outside this was an empty house.
She steadied herself, the more readily because something in the narrow

eyes twinkling into hers said that Jim Logan had expected her to

scream and make a scene. Never until now had she imagined it possible

to be afraid of him. In the park, when he had stopped his car to

follow and speak to her, she had been a little startled, a good deal

annoyed. Then, when Ursus had opportunely arrived to frighten him

away as easily as the Spider frightened Miss Muffet, she had been

impishly amused.
In Toys at Peter Rolls's she had been vexed, irritated, but never

hotly angry. The young man's persistence had not seemed serious enough

to call "persecution." She had rather enjoyed "shunting" him off upon

Lily Leavitt, and thwarting him through Cupid and Earl Usher. It had

never occurred to her that behind the unfailing smile and the

twinkling gray eyes the brutal ferocity of the animal might lurk.
She had thought that he had forgotten her long ago and turned his

attentions elsewhere. What girl, unless silly and Victorian, would be

afraid of a dude who lived for the sleekness of his hair and the

spick-and-spanness of his clothes? Yet now Win was afraid, and she did

not think it was because she had suddenly become silly or Victorian.

This aquiline-faced young man with the prominent jaw was looking at

her as the primitive brute looks at the prey under his paws, and if he

smiled and twinkled, it was but as the primitive brute might purr.
Winifred thought of this, and she thought, too, that when the prey had

presence of mind to feign sleep or death the brute was said not to

kill, after all.
She did not put her hand into the hand that Logan held out, but

neither did she turn to run from him. "This is quite a surprise," she

remarked quietly.
"A pleasant surprise, I hope," he suggested.
"A sort of practical joke, I suppose," the girl said.
"Well, yes, that's just what it is," Logan smiled, evidently wondering

at her calmness and not sure whether to take it as a good or bad omen.

"It seemed to be the only way I could get you to accept any

invitation of mine."
"Rather a high-handed way!" said Win, shrugging her shoulders.

"Still—here I am. This seems to be a nice house. Is it yours?"
"It's my father's. We're all supposed to be somewhere else for the

summer. But I run in sometimes. My servant looks after me. He's as

devoted as the servants in books. I pay him to be. There's nothing I

want done that he wouldn't do."
"He appears to have made you a very nice supper." Win's eyes rested on

the table.
"Nothing could be too good for you. If I've got you here—well, sort

of under false pretences—there'll be no false pretences about

anything else now I have got you. There's a little surprise in those

flowers by your plate. I hope you'll like it."
"A peace offering?" suggested Win lightly.
"Yes. And a love token. You know I've been in love with you, you

bewitching thing, just madly in love, since that night in the park. I

never rested till I saw you again at Peter Rolls's. And then I knew I

couldn't rest until––"
"Wait!" exclaimed Win, putting out both hands to hold him off as he

came close. "Wait—please!" She still spoke lightly. "I'm your

guest. I quite understand that 'might makes right!' But there's

another law—the law of hospitality, isn't there? This is—a great

adventure. Let me get into the spirit of it before you say or do any

more. Give me time—to breathe. Where may I put my cloak? Perhaps

you've a long mirror somewhere? I want to see if I'm beautiful enough

for my background."
Logan yielded to the hands which pushed him away. It charmed him that

this tall, spirited creature was taking things in a debonair way. He

thought it splendid that she should talk of an adventure and of

entering into the spirit of it. If she had made a fuss and tried to

escape and refused to eat supper with him, there would have been some

pleasure in conquering, but not the same pleasure there would be in a

jolly little supper with a pretty girl who gayly acknowledged that the

"joke was on her," and then making love to her afterward.
Not that he quite trusted the strange creature yet. She might be like

a kitten that submits to be petted while lying in wait for its chance

to spring. But this kitten might lie in wait as long as it liked. The

chance to spring wouldn't come. By and by the kitten would discover

that fact if the hope were in its mind, for he meant business this

time.
"There's a room next door my mother and sister use for their boudoir,"

he said graciously. "It's full of long mirrors, and you can have all

the electric light you want, but the furniture's covered up. The

dining-room and my den are the only places that are shipshape, I'm

afraid."
Logan walked out into the hall and threw open one of the doors that

opened into it. "Here you are!" he announced, switching on a blaze of

electric light that showed a small room shrouded in white covers. "The

first thing you see is a life-size picture of yourself. I guess that's

what you want."
"You have guessed right. You deserve a prize," Win answered.
In the lighted boudoir a mirror faced the door.
"Will you give me a few minutes to myself?" she asked. "I may just as

well confess that this surprise of yours has—gone to my head a

little, as your champagne probably will—when I drink it. The hot

weather has been taking it out of me horribly, and I'm not very

strong. If I may sit still for five minutes and shut my eyes and

think, why—I'm sure I shall be a more amusing guest at supper."
Logan, who had touched the electric-light switch inside the door,

stood on the threshold, barring the way. Win did not try to push past

him, nor did she show any impatience, nor even eagerness. He stared

her in the eyes as if to ask: "What trick do you hope to play, I

wonder? Do you think I'm such a blamed idiot as to leave a way out

open after all the trouble and expense I've put myself to on your

account?"
But being perfectly sure that there was no way out, no trick in her

power seemed worth worrying about—unless she had some melodramatic

little bottle of poison concealed about her which she would drain and

die, like the heroine of an old-fashioned play. He was certain that

the brave, vital young creature who had seized his fancy would do

nothing of the kind, however, and he felt that it was safe to humour

her.
"You can even go to sleep on the sofa, if you like, provided you'll

promise to dream of me," he said, "and if you'll let me come and wake

you up. Oh, I've caught you looking at the keyhole! There's no key in

it, you see, for me to lock you in—or for you to lock me out."
"Neither of us would be so medieval, would we?" she laughed. "That

would be a silly way to begin the evening. Now that I am here I am

going to make the very, very best of it, I promise you!"
"That's right! You're the girl of my heart!" said Logan, and, stepping

away from the door, let her walk into the lighted boudoir.
Gently and slowly, almost coquettishly, she shut him out, smiling into

his face until the oak panels had closed between him and her.
 
 
CHAPTER XXI
THE TELEPHONE
The boudoir was stuffy and smelled of moth powder With its ivory-white

walls and masses of sheeting it looked crudely bright in the glare of

electricity switched on by Logan. A glance at the closed bay window

showed that outside the glass was a screen of unpainted wood. There

was no door save that through which Win had just entered.
All the furniture was pushed against the walls, except a writing-desk

with gilded legs, which stood in the embrasure of the big window, and

to this the girl ran softly, on tiptoe, across the bare parquet floor.

It was covered with sheeting, which she turned carefully back that

nothing might be disturbed and, in falling, make a noise. Almost she

had reached the limit of her strength and had no breath even to

whisper the "Thank heaven!" she felt, seeing what she had prayed to

find—a telephone and directory.
It was the hope of this that had upheld her through the scene which

already seemed dreamlike. But though telephone and book were here, she

was far enough yet from being out of danger. She had not seen the

house number, as the boards which covered the front door covered it

also. Knowing the street and the name of the man who owned the house

(if Logan had told the truth), she could find the telephone number in

the book, but it meant a waste of time.
And then, Logan might have lied. This might not be his father's house.

Or, if it were, the telephone might have been cut off for the summer

in the family's absence. She could not be sure of that till the last

moment, for the instant Logan heard her talk he would try to tear her

away from the telephone. If only there were a key or a bolt—the

frailest, slightest bolt, just strong enough to keep the man out for

five minutes! But it was useless to wish for what could not be. She

must do her best with the ammunition at hand, and be quick about it,

for here was her fort of refuge, and she must hold it while she fired

her one shot.
On the desk lay a large tortoise-shell paper knife. That, thrust under

the door as a wedge, would be almost as good as a lock. At least she

might count on it to protect her for those so necessary five minutes.

But if she pushed it through to the other side Jim Logan would see the

flat, brown blade stick out like a defiant tongue over the door sill,

if he were in the hall keeping watch. Knowing that she could not

escape, perhaps he had returned to the dining-room, perhaps he was

giving instructions to his servant—perhaps any one of a dozen things,

yet she could not count on any of them!
She took the paper knife, and holding it firmly by its carved handle,

she put the blade under the sole of her foot and thus snapped it off

short.
The thick end, still attached to the handle, was just not too thick to

push part way under the door. Win could only hope that it might hold

when need came.
Now for the book! As she began turning over the pages she found that

her hands were trembling. She had to repeat the alphabet from the

beginning before she could remember where the letter "L" came in.
Yes, there was the name—Logan. There were many Logans, but only one

in this particular street. With a blunt pencil attached to a small

writing-pad she scribbled down the telephone and house number to have

them before her eyes, lest in her frantic excitement she might confuse

the two in her mind.
These preparations made, the girl's heart quickened as the fateful

moment came. The prompt response from Central was heavenly music. The

Logan family had not studied economy and cut off their telephone.

"Give me the nearest police station quick!" she added to the number,

and at the sound of an hysterical note in her voice Logan's hand was

on the door knob.
If the wedge failed she was lost. But bending over the desk, the

receiver at her ear, she dared not turn to see what was happening.
"You young devil! Let me in, or you'll be sorry all your life!" Logan

shouted through the door, giving the heavy oak panels a kick.
"Is that the police?" Win spoke loudly that Logan might hear. She gave

the number of the house, then hurried on: "For God's sake send at

once. The house is shut up, but by a trick a girl has been brought in

by young Mr. Logan. She's in great danger. It's she who is

calling—begging for help—quick—quick—he's here!"
Crash! The door flew wide and banged against the wall, Logan almost

falling into the room as the wedge shook loose. Slipping on the

smooth parquet, he lost his balance for an instant, and before he

could reach the girl to snatch the receiver from her hand, she had

dashed through the door and into the hall. There she would have been

stopped by the servant if she had not dodged under his arm and darted

into the dining-room. Once in, she slammed the door shut in the face

of Logan's man, and fumbled wildly to turn the key her trembling

fingers found.
Something was wrong—or else it was the fault of those shaking

fingers. The key would not turn. Win set her shoulder to the door and

pushed against the panels with the whole strength of her slim body.

But it was not enough. The door gave and pushed her back. Then,

realizing that she could not hold it against superior force, she

suddenly let go and ran to stand at bay behind the table.
When Jim Logan, all the latent brutality in him wide awake, came

bounding over the threshold she faced him across his silver and

flowers and glittering glass.
"Come here!" he said in a voice curiously unlike the jovial tones she

had known as his.
"No!" she panted. "I'll stay where I am till the police arrest you as

a kidnapper."
"You'll not stay!" he flung at her. "If you won't come out of that,

I'll fetch you."
The girl stood behind one of the two chairs drawn up to the table and

both hands convulsively clutched the high, carved back. But seeing him

spring toward her, she lost her nerve for the first time. Trying to

make a screen of the chair, she felt the floating gauze of her dress

catch on some unseen nail or splinter of broken woods struggled to

tear it free, and found herself in Logan's arms. The shrill sound of

ripping stitches and tearing gauze mingled with the sharp blow of the

girl's palm on the man's ear, and his oath breathed hot on her cheek.
"You fool, do you think I wish to keep you after what you've done?" he

blurted out. "All I ask is to be rid of you before those fellows get

here. I thought I'd have one kiss—but I wouldn't take it now if you

gave it to me. Sims, run down into the basement and let her out that

way. Now, you young devil, after him, if you don't want to be choked

and buried in the cellar."
Hardly knowing what she did, Win obeyed. Tripping in the rags of her

torn gown, she followed the man, who opened a door that led to a

narrow stairway. Next came a vague vision of a basement corridor and a

disordered kitchen. A minute later she was pushed into a dark area, a

door was shut behind her, she was stumbling up some stone steps; then,

hurrying along the street as fast as she could go, conscious only that

danger was behind her, that she must fly from it and put a long

distance between her and that closed house.
If Win had known that the door had shut upon Jim Logan also, and that

he had walked out of the house almost on her heels, she would have

hurried even faster. But she did not know. And luckily he took the

opposite direction, making straight for the New Cosmopolitan Club at

the corner, which she had noticed when passing in the taxi.
Hardly five minutes after he had interrupted his guest in her call to

the police, Jim Logan was inquiring of the hall porter whether Mr.

Fred Fortescue had come in that evening.
"He came, sir, but has gone out again," replied the man, thinking that

the immaculate Mr. Logan—one of the best-dressed, best-groomed

members of the New Cosmopolitan—appeared to be feeling the heat

severely.
"Jove, I'm sorry to hear that," and Logan's expression confirmed his

words. "I wanted to see him badly. Let me think. Who else is here?

What about Mr. Pindar?"
"Hasn't been in, sir, for weeks," was the reply.
"Gee!" muttered Logan. He seemed worried, and in the brilliant light

of the fine hall—white-panelled, and hung with clever caricatures of

well-known men—his face was pale and even drawn. He looked, it

occurred to the hall porter (a man of imagination), rather like a

caricature of himself, not so well coloured as those on the walls.

Evidently conning the names of friends who might be useful in an

emergency, Logan's eyes were fixed on the stairway, as if thence

inspiration or salvation might come. He had the air of having sent his

astral body hastily upstairs to reconnoitre the reading and smoking

room, but at that minute Peter Rolls, Jr., appeared on the landing,

and Logan and his astral body joined forces again.
"Hello, Rolls!" he called out. "You're just the man I want. Will you

do me a great favour in a big hurry?"
Petro, whose inmost self had also been absent on some errand, came to

earth again with a slight start. "Hello!" he echoed, hastening his

steps.
He did not care much for Logan, who had been a classmate of his at

college, and whose acquaintance he had not cultivated since. Still he

had nothing against the fellow except that he was a "dude" and

something of an ass, whose outlook on life was so different from

Petro's that friendship was impossible. They met occasionally at the

New Cosmopolitan Club, of which they had both been members for some

years, and at houses where their different "sets" touched distantly.

If they talked at all, they talked of old times, but each bored the

other. Petro, however, could never bear to refuse any one a favour,

even if granting it were an uncongenial task. This peculiarity was

constitutional and too well known for his comfort.
"What do you want me to do?" he asked in a tone polite, but void of

personal interest.
"To come home with me quick and get me out of a horrid scrape. No

trouble for you—but a lot for me without a pal to see me through. I

won't keep you more than a few minutes, if you're engaged anywhere."
"I'm not engaged. But—" Petro began, only to be cut short.
"Come along, then, for the Lord's sake. Tell you everything when we're

there." And taking Rolls affectionately by the arm, the other rushed

him out of the club.
"House shut up, you know. But I stay there. My man'll let us in the

basement way, if you don't mind," Logan explained disjointedly as they

hurried along the street to the dwelling four doors away.
Sims, obedient to instructions flung at him over his master's shoulder

when the girl had been let out, now awaited Logan's return at the

tradesmen's entrance. The two young men were admitted and the door

locked behind them. A minute more and they were in the rosily glowing

dining-room, where the white table still offered attractive

refreshment.
"Sit down," said Logan, and as he said it a great knocking began

somewhere.
Listening in surprise, Petro forgot to accept the invitation—which

might have been more tempting if he had not, about half an hour ago,

finished dinner. Logan repeated the words, however, and even pulled

out a chair for Petro, who took it. Logan seized the other, and Petro,

following his host's example, drew up to the table. Still the pounding

went on, more loudly than before, if possible. It began to seem rather

like something in a play when you had missed the first scene and

didn't quite understand what it was all about.
"I think, sir, it's some one at the door," calmly announced Sims,

raising his voice decorously, to be heard over the noise. "Shall I see

who it is, or shall I let them knock and go away?"
"See who it is, and if it's the police, make no objection to their

coming in. Be surprised, but not frightened, and say Mr. Logan has a

friend supping with him. Savvy?"
"Yes, sir," responded Sims, and vanished.
"No time to let you into this stunt on the ground floor," went on

Logan. "But I will as soon as the turn's over. For all sakes, keep mum

while I talk."
Before Petro could answer, if he had an answer ready, there were deep

voices in the hall. Then the door was opened by Sims, and two

plain-clothes policemen stepped briskly in.
"Hello! What's up? House on fire?" exclaimed Logan, pausing in the

act of handing a dish of iced caviar to his guest.
"We're not from the fire department," said the elder and smarter

looking of the pair, civilly, yet with a certain grimness. "I guess

you know that well enough. We've been sent here on a hurry call on

your 'phone to the police—a girl supposed to be detained in the house

against her will." And keen eyes took in the details of the room.
Logan broke into a jovial guffaw. "Girl? Well, of all—the

freak—stunts!" he chortled. "Say, Rolls, are you the great female

impersonator? Ha, ha!"
"Sorry to interrupt you and your friend," remarked the detective,

still grimly, though he had caught and been slightly impressed by the

name of Rolls, as the speaker had, perhaps, intended. Logan as a name

also carried some weight in New York. One was not rude to a Logan

until sure how far and fast duty compelled one to proceed. "But I

gotta ask you straight whether there's a girl in this house, and you'd

better answer the same way."
Logan stopped laughing. "Really, I thought at first you were some of

the fellows from the club got up in disguise for a joke," he said. "Of

course I'll answer you straight. There's no girl in this house so far

as I know, and hasn't been since my sister went away with the rest of

the folks, 2d of June. I can't think how such a—but gee! yes, I can!

The silly old sucker! I bet it's a put-up job."
"What d'ye mean?" the plain-clothes man wanted to know.
"Why, does the name of Frederick Doland Fortescue mean anything to

you?"
"We know who he is."
"Well, then, I guess you know he's the champion practical joker of

this burg. He was here a while ago—hasn't been gone a quarter of an

hour. Went just before Mr. Rolls came in. Asked if he could use the

telephone. I said yes, and my servant showed him into my mother's

boudoir next to this room. I heard him ring up some one, but didn't

get what he said. I noticed when he was through he came out chuckling,

and then he was off like a shot—told me he had a date uptown

somewhere. That's all I know, but it would be like him to play just

such a fool trick on you and me."
"Seems 'twas a woman's voice at the 'phone."
"Gee! I did sort of get onto it, he was mimicking a girl! Sounded kind

of shrill, but I didn't pay attention. He's always up to some lark.

You're welcome to go over the house, though, if you don't believe me."
"It ain't a question of believing or not," said the detective. "But

we'll have to look around."
"All right!" returned Logan, still with that perfect good nature which

was having its effect on the two intruders. "Would you rather do the

job by your lones, or shall my man show you the way? I suppose you

don't mind us going on with our supper if I spare you Sims and we help

ourselves to food?"
"You can stay where you are," was the answer.
"Thanks. But when you're satisfied that a mosquito or so's the only

live stock on the premises, I should like you both to crack a bottle

of champagne with us."
"It wouldn't be quite in order––"
"Hang order! The police and I are pals. Now you'll do me proud if

you'll look in on your way out. Bring the girl, if you find her!" And

Logan laughed at his own joke.
"Don't think I've let you in for anything!" he turned to Rolls as the

door shut. "They'll find no one, for the good reason that there's no

one to find. All the same, I should have been in a mess if you hadn't

come right along like a brick and helped me out."
"I don't quite see yet how I have helped you," rather dryly remarked

Petro.
"But I guess you're guessing."
"If I've guessed right, I'm not enjoying the joke."
"Then maybe you haven't guessed right! Give me the benefit of the

doubt till those good men and true are the other side of the front

door, will you? I'm as rattled as they make 'em now! Say, this is a

raid, ain't it? Wonder if they've got the Black Maria outside? Can't

you eat any caviar? Wish you would. Well, shall we skip along to the

consommé?"
"I've just got down my dinner," said Rolls, who was guessing too hard

to taste anything with salt in it, in his old classmate's house.
"Well, a little of this champagne cup, anyhow? It's girls' drink, but

not bad this weather, and old Sims is a nailer at mixing—"
"No, thanks, nothing at all."
"You must let me half fill your glass, or those chaps will get onto it

that you're playing dummy!" As he spoke Logan poured champagne cup

into Peter's tall tumbler and his own. The latter he filled with the

ice-cold, sparkling liquid which, as he said, was "girls' drink," and

then, seizing the glass, emptied it in one long draft.
It was he who did most of the talking that whiled away time till the

policemen returned from their tour of the house; and when they opened

the door of the dining-room once more he was eating chicken salad

while Peter crumbled toast.
"I don't see the lady!" Logan exclaimed facetiously, with his mouth

full.
"Neither did we," said the man who had taken the lead.
"Hope you did the thing thoroughly while you were about it! Garret to

cellar and all the rest?"
"You bet we did," returned the policeman, allowing himself the relief

of a grin now. "I guess you was right about the practical joke. But

you must excuse us if we look behind these curtains."
"Under the table, too!" laughed Logan, jumping to his feet. "Stand and

deliver, Rolls!"
Petro obeyed rather reluctantly, feeling that he had been made a fool

of, at best, in his stupid wish to be good-natured. It might be a

joke, as Logan insisted, but something told him it was not. The look

on the fellow's face as he gulped down the champagne cup had not been

funny. It was in Petro's mind that he had been brought in to cover up

with his presence an unpleasant incident and ignorantly to trick the

police.
Of course, if there were a girl in the house, the police would have

found her. But—there was something queer. He meant to have it all out

with Logan when the police were gone. Meantime, however, he behaved

loyally and stood up to leave the table clear while one of the

detectives did actually bend down to peer under it. As the policeman

stooped Peter mechanically pulled the chair back, and doing so he

caught sight of a thin blue streak lying, like solidified cigarette

smoke, across the red brocade cushion. In this smoke-blue streak there

were little things that glistened—little silver things shaped like

crescent moons set at regular intervals from each other. Peter had

been unconsciously sitting on the smoke wreath, and as the policeman

rose he deliberately sat down on it again. He felt suddenly sick, and

his heart was large and cold in his breast, where it did not beat, but

floundered like a caught fish.
 
 
CHAPTER XXII
THE FRAGRANCE OF FRESIAS
Winifred Child had been in this house, or else she had sold or given

the Moon dress to another girl who had been here.
Thoughts were flashing through Peter's brain with the sharp quickness

of motion pictures following one another to a far conclusion. Of the

girl he could not be sure. The lost dryad, needing money more than she

needed a smart evening gown, might well have disposed of Ena's gift.

And yet Petro had—strangely enough it had seemed to him then—thought

of Winifred and the mysterious "dryad door" on the Monarchic the

moment he came into this place.
The perfume of the mirror room was here—the perfume which made all

Nadine's model dresses delicately fragrant of spring flowers; fresias,

the youngest dryad had said they were; and since then Peter had asked

for fresias at the florist's, requested the Scottish head gardener to

plant fresias in the garden, and had kept fresias in his room to call

back old dreams. If the dryad had sold her dress, would the fresia

fragrance haunt it still? Petro thought not. The other woman would

have given it her own special perfume. Only in the possession of a

dryad would it have retained this scent.
Winifred Child had been here, then—in Logan's dining-room, near

Logan's table laid so alluringly for a supper en tête-à-tête!
This idea, passing through several phases, had shaped itself clearly

in Peter Rolls's mind by the time the policeman's round black head had

come up from under the table. And it was because of the idea that he

sat down deliberately on the film of chiffon. He did not want

questions to be asked, or Winifred Child's name to be mentioned in

this business, at all events, until he had made up his mind what to

do.
There was still time to make it up, and speak, if necessary while the

detectives were on the spot, for Logan had offered them champagne and

they had accepted now they were sure that all parties had been

victimized by a practical joker. "Girls' drink" was not for the

guardians of New York, and Sims was opening two frosty-looking bottles

of the "real thing" just produced from some household iceberg The men

would not go for several moments yet.
Winifred Child had listened to Ena Rolls's warnings and had taken them

deeply to heart. It had seemed to her impossible that a sister could,

for any motive whatever, calumniate a brother whom she loved. And

then, Win had reminded herself that her own ignorance of men was

profound They were said to be "all alike" in some dreadful ways, even

those who seemed the noblest, the most chivalrous—or more especially

those. So she had believed Ena's words, against her own instinct, and

had not told herself that she lacked her favourite virtue—loyalty.
But with Peter it was exactly the opposite. He trusted his instinct

before everything, and though he thought that his lost dryad had been

in this shut-up house with Jim Logan, he knew that she had come

innocently.
Somehow Logan had met her, admired her (that went without saying), and

tricked her into the place. When she had understood the trick she had,

of course, tried to get away. (Why, if proof were needed, was not the

torn wisp of chiffon enough?) Her quick intelligence had suggested the

telephone, and somehow she had contrived to call the police before she

could be stopped by Logan.
Yes, that was like her! Then Logan had been scared and let her go,

lest she should be found and he should get into disgrace. This was the

natural thing for such a man to do in the circumstances, and equally

natural that he should dash out to find a supper companion—some

accommodating fellow whose presence would account for the table with

its two places.
But that he—he, of all men in New York, should be the accommodating

fellow found to screen the beast from punishment! This was the

astounding thing—the terrible thing—and yet, the providential thing.

Through Logan and the coincidence which had brought them together at a

certain moment in the hall of the New Cosmopolitan Club, Petro told

himself that he would by and by reach Winifred Child. It was a hateful

combination of circumstances; but finding her thus would be no worse

than discovering a rare jewel in a toad's head.
While the two detectives tossed off their champagne Peter Rolls sat

still, his thoughts flashing on behind a face deprived of all

expression, as a screen of motionless dark trees can hide the white

rush and sparkle of a cataract. His vague contempt for Jim Logan had

turned in the last few minutes to active loathing, even to hatred. He

wanted the fellow punished, as he would have wanted a rattlesnake to

have its poison fangs drawn. He wished to speak out and tell the now

laughing policemen the brief story of Logan's hurried visit to the

club.
Down would go the half-full champagne glasses on the table. The

cheerful grins would be wiped from the two strong faces as by an

artist who, with a stroke, changes the expression of a portrait. Peter

Rolls's word was at least as good as Jim Logan's. Questions would be

asked. Jottings would be made in notebooks. Perhaps they would both

have to go to the police station. The girl's name would be demanded;

Logan might be forced to tell it. That would be one way of finding

Winifred—but it would be a way intolerable.
If only Peter were certain—as certain as he was of her

innocence—that she wasn't hidden in the house, he would let the

detectives go quietly and get the truth out of Logan himself

afterward. But—could he be certain? Had he a right to take such

chances when the girl's safety might depend on police knowledge of her

whereabouts?
It was reasonable to suppose that Logan had put her into the street

after the giving of the alarm and before he ran to the club. Yet he

might not have done so. She might be fainting, or even dead. The most

terrible, melodramatic things happened every day in New York. One saw

them in the papers and felt they could never come into one's own life.

Supposing there were some hiding-place?
The fishlike flopping of Peter's heart slowed down as if the fish were

losing strength. The thought was too hideous to finish. Yet he would

not dismiss it until he had played his hand in the game.
So far he had hardly spoken since the sight of the blue smoke wreath

on the chair had set his brain whirling. But when Logan suddenly

challenged him to drink a health to the New York police, he took the

glass of champagne Sims offered.
"Here's to you!" he said. "I never had such a good chance to

appreciate the thoroughness of your methods! By Jove! think of looking

even under the table! Now that would never have occurred to me."
"I guess it would," one of the men encouraged him, "if you had our

experience. It gets to be second nature to be thorough. We never, so

to speak, leave a stone unturned"
"Well, it's mighty smart of you, that's all I can say!" young Mr.

Rolls went on. "What do you call being thorough—not 'leaving a stone

unturned?' Here, for instance how can you be sure you've looked in

every hole and cranny where Mr. Logan might have stowed a young woman

in a dead faint, if he wanted to fool you?"
Both men laughed. "You ought to bin with us when we went on our trip

around the house!"
"I wish I had! It would have been a sort of experience," said Peter.

"I sometimes read detective stories and wonder if they're like the

real thing. When you were out of the room I was thinking if we'd had a

girl hidden in here—behind the curtains, for instance—we might have

sneaked her away when you were upstairs or down in the basement."
They laughed again, patronizing the amateur. "You must take us for

Uncle Ezras from Wayback!" genially sneered he who claimed leadership.

"We didn't 'both' go upstairs—or in the basement. While I waited in

the hall my mate slipped down and locked the door that lets into the

area and brought away the key on him. What's more, he did something to

the keyhole—a little secret we know—that would have told us if any

one had used another key while we were gone. But no one did. Good

guard was kept, and if a mouse had tried to slip by we'd 'a' caught

it."
"But what if a mouse had tried to hide?" suggested Peter Rolls.
"We'd 'a' found it. There ain't a closet or a pair o' curtains or a

shower bath or bookcase or a screen or bureau or table or bed that's

had a chance to keep a secret from us––"
"Did you ever hear the song of 'The Mistletoe Bough?'" inquired the

doubter.
"You bet we did. You don't have to show us! We snooped all around the

trunk room and rummaged in every box big enough to hold a dwarf. None

of 'em was locked, but if they had been—why, we go around prepared."
"You don't look as if you'd done much prowling in the coal cellar,

anyhow!" laughed Peter.
"That's because there ain't enough coal in it to dirty a dove,"

explained the policeman. "Why, we even had a squint into the wine bins

and the kitchen pantries and under the sink and into a laundry basket.

There ain't a fly on the wall in this house but we wouldn't know its

face if we met it again!"
They all laughed once more, and none more loudly than Logan, though

he had given Peter Rolls a puzzled glance for each new and apparently

aimless question.
"If I wrote those detective stories, I'd use this for a plot," Petro

went on; "but it wouldn't be much good to the magazines the way it's

turned out. I think I'd have a girl hidden behind a sliding panel, or

a picture that came out of its frame, or something, and the hero find

her."
"Then you mustn't lay your plot in this house," retorted the officer.

"There ain't any pictures a full-sized cat could crawl through, and as

for Mr. Logan's panels, they look real nice, but I guess they're the

kind you buy by the yard. And there ain't a room with a wall that

could open to hide anything thicker than a paper doll."
He earned a laugh again on that climax. Peter said that he would have

to go to some old country on the other side to write the kind of story

he meant. The men finished their champagne and had more. Then they

finished that with a gay health (proposed by their host) to Freddy

Fortescue. And at last there was no doubt that the time had come to

go.
Logan shook hands with both and pressed gifts of cigars and cigarettes

upon them. If Peter intended to give Logan away, now was the latest,

the very latest moment. But he said not a word. Satisfied that the

girl could not possibly be concealed in the house, her name must not

be risked. While Logan accompanied the guardians of the law to the

front door, opened by Sims for their benefit, Peter annexed the blue

smoke wreath. A splinter of wood (the furniture was only imitation

Jacobean) had impaled the rag of chiffon, and almost tenderly

releasing it, Rolls folded the trophy away in a breast pocket.
His imagination had not tricked him. The stuff did smell of

fresias—which he proved by holding it to his lips for an instant—the

very scent that had come out to him whenever the dryad door opened, in

reality and memory, the scent he had grown intimate with while the

Moon dress hung in his wardrobe during those days when he had awaited

a chance to present his offering to Ena!
When Logan came back he turned to tell Sims at the door that he would

not be needed again, at any rate, for the present. Then he shut

himself and Peter into the rosy glow of the dining-room.
"At last!" he exclaimed, sinking contentedly into the chair opposite

Rolls. "I feel as if I'd earned a whole bottle of drink. But all's

well that ends well."
"It hasn't quite ended yet, has it?" remarked Peter. "No, thank you,

no champagne!"
"Not ended?" repeated Logan, bottle in hand. "Oh, I see what you're

at!" and he began filling his own glass, already emptied half a dozen

times during the visit of the detectives. "You mean you want an

explanation of this hanky panky. Well, I promised it to you, didn't I?

I said you must give me the benefit of the doubt till those chaps were

out of the house. I hope you have. But I thought once or twice you

looked a bit thick, as if you weren't sure what I'd let you in for.

But I'm not the kind of chap to get a pal in a fix to save my own

face. I'm going to explain, all right. Only first I want to thank you

again for––"
"You needn't," said Peter.
"Sure you won't change your mind and take a little fizz? We've been

through some hot work for this weather."
"You have. No—not any!"
"One go at mine, then, and I'm yours. A-ah! that was pretty good.

Well—there was a girl, of course. But she came because she wanted

to come. Then the trouble began. There was a little misunderstanding

about a pearl dog collar she admired in a jeweller's window. She

seemed disappointed to find that this wasn't to be the occasion of a

presentation. Said I'd promised. I hadn't! I never do promise

beforehand to give girls things. Girls would love to have the same

effect on your money the sun has on ice. Not that this one's like all

the others. She's worth a little expenditure. A real stunner! Any

fellow'd be wild over her. An English girl, tall and slim, but

gorgeous figure: long legs and throat, and dark eyes as big as

saucers. You'd turn and look after her anywhere! A lady, and thinks

herself the queen, though she works in a New York department store.

I've been running after her since one night we made acquaintance in

the park—great chums—called each other Jim and Winnie and held hands

from the first.
"But to-night, just because I said I'd never promised a dog collar or

anything like one, she went mad as a tiger cat and took revenge by

ringing up the police with a beast of a story that I'd kidnapped her.

She got it out before I could make her stop, and for just a minute I

was in a blue funk. New York's rampagin' so just now on the subject of

kidnappers. But I had wit enough to chuck her into the street and run

to the club for help. I thought of Freddy Fortescue (by the way, I

must get him to stand by me with a story in case he's questioned. I

can count on him every time!), but he wasn't in. I tried another man

or two, same result, and just then I saw you coming downstairs—ram

caught in the bushes."
"For the sacrifice," Peter finished.
"Well, not too much of a sacrifice, I hope," Logan temporized "You

don't regret standing by?"
"No, I don't regret it."
"Yet your tone sounds sort of odd, as if you were keeping something

back. I don't see why, either. I've kept my promise. I've

explained—put the whole story in a nutshell, not to bore you too much

with my love affairs gone bad. And what I've told you is the Gospel's

own truth, old man, whether you believe it or not."
"I don't believe it," said Peter. "I know it to be the devil's own

lie."
As he spoke he rose, and Logan jumped up, hot and red in the face.
"By Jove!" he sputtered. "I don't know what you mean."
"You know very well," Rolls insisted. "I mean—that you're a liar. A

damn liar! The girl didn't come here because she wanted to come. And

she wouldn't take a pearl collar or a paper collar from you if you

went on your knees."
"You must be crazy!" Logan stared at him, paler now. "If you weren't

my guest, in my house, I—I'd knock you down."
"Try it," Peter invited him. "This is your father's house, I believe,

not yours. And I don't call myself your guest. Neither need you. I'm a

sort of out-of-season April Fool. At least, I was. I'm not now."
"I tell you—you're bughouse!" stammered Logan.
"You stand up for a girl you don't know a damn thing about––"
"I'd stand up for any girl against you," he was cut short again. "But

I do know this girl. I won't say how. I know you're the dirt under her

feet, and if I hadn't made sure every way that she was out of the

house, I'd have set the police onto you as—as I wouldn't set

terriers onto a rat."
"You—you can't tell me her name—or anything about her—I'll bet!"
"You won't bet with me. And neither of us is going to speak her name

here. Shut your mouth on it if you don't want it stuffed down your

throat and your teeth after it. You've been a villain. That's the one

thing that stands out in this business. God! do you think you could

make me believe anything wrong about that girl—you? Why, if an

angel looped the loop down from heaven to do it I wouldn't. Tell me

what store she's working in. That's what I want to hear about her from

you, and nothing else."
Logan was not red in the face now. He had grown very pale. In truth,

he was frightened. But he was angry enough to hide his fear for the

present. He determined that Rolls should not get a word out of him.
"That's all you want to hear, is it?" he mimicked. "If you know so

much about her, you can jolly well find out the rest for yourself or

keep off the grass. I don't intend—"
The sentence ended in an absurd gurgle, for the hand of Peter Rolls

was twisting his high collar. It was horribly uncomfortable and made

him feel ridiculous, because he was taller and bigger and older than

Rolls. He tried to hit Peter in the face with his fist, but suddenly

all strength went out of him. The hated face vanished behind a shower

of sparks.
"You're murdering—me!" he gasped. "I've—got—a weak heart."
Peter let go and flung him across the room. He tottered toward the

door. And his servant, who had been breathlessly listening outside,

opened it opportunely on the instant. Logan saw his chance, as Sims

meant him to do, half fell, half staggered out, and the door slammed

in Peter's face.
It took the latter no more than thirty seconds to wrench it open again

and drag Sims, who was holding desperately to the knob, into the

dining-room. "Don't hurt me, sir!" the man pleaded. "I only did my

duty."
"Hurt you!" repeated Rolls with a laugh. "Don't be afraid. Where's the

other coward?"
"If you are referring to Mr. Logan, sir," Sims replied politely, "he

is gone. If you look for him, I think you will find he has quite

gone. I had the front door open, all ready, in case it should be

needed."
Peter reflected for an instant, and then shrugged his shoulders.
"Let him go!" he said. "I'd as soon step twice on a toad that was

hopping away as touch him again. Br-r! This place is sickening. I'll

go, too—but not after him."
"Yes, sir, certainly," returned Sims with alacrity, slinking along the

hall to the vestibule. "I'll open the front door for you. This," he

added with a certain emphasis "will be the fourth time I've done so

to-night. Once to let Mr. Logan in, once when the young ladies came,

and––"
"Ah, there were two of them!" Rolls caught him up.
"Yes, sir. And though I did my duty just now helping Mr. Logan—if I

may say it, sir, without offence—helping him out of danger, I am

ready to assist you, sir, by answering any questions you may wish to

ask. I do not consider my doing so disloyal to my employer. My

statements won't hurt him, I assure you. And if you would—er––"
"Would 'make it worth your while,' I suppose you're trying to get

out," Peter disgustedly prompted him.
"I have a wife to support, sir, and a child. I keep them in the

country, and it comes expensive."
"Give me ten dollars' worth of talk," ordered Peter, "and I'll believe

as much as I choose."
He was half ashamed of himself for stooping to bribe the fellow who

perhaps, after all, was only trying to delay him. Yet he might have

something worth hearing. He could not afford to lose a chance.
"Two young ladies came as far as the door, sir," said Sims, pocketing

the greenback, "but only one came into the house—a tall, handsome

young lady, different looking from most, with a thin yellowish silk

cloak over a blue dress. She walked right in, but when she found her

friend was gone she seemed surprised, and the next thing she was in

the boudoir telephoning. Mr. Logan went in and she came out. They had

a little dispute, I think, and though he'd been expecting her to

supper, he told me to get her out of the house as quick as I could. I

showed her through the basement, and she walked, rather briskly I

should say, sir, down the street, while Mr. Logan went in the other

direction—toward the corner, where the club is. As for the young

ladies themselves, I can give you no information, except that the one

who didn't come in to-night has been here before on several occasions.

The one who came in and—er—used the telephone, I have never

previously seen. That's all I know which you don't know yourself. But

I hope I've been of some assistance to make up for doing my

disagreeable duty, sir?"
"I've had ten dollars' worth, thank you," said Peter. "And now for the

fourth time of opening that door."
He went out, satisfied that he was carrying with him the only trace of

Winifred Child from the shut-up house. To-morrow he would begin with

the opening of the shops and look through every department store until

he found her.
 
 
CHAPTER XXIII
MOTHER
Peter Rolls, as it oddly happened, had run up to New York that hot

night in order to see a girl do a "turn" at a vaudeville theatre—an

English girl about whom he had read a newspaper paragraph, and who

might, he thought, be Winifred Child. The girl's stage name was

Winifred Cheylesmore. The newspaper described her as "tall, dark, and

taking, with a voice like Devonshire cream."
She was a new girl, of whom nobody had heard, and Peter had been

thrilled and impatient. Her "singing stunt" was to be heard at ten

o'clock, and Peter had dined at his club, meaning to be early in his

seat at the theatre. But a man he knew, sitting at a table near, was a

budding journalist, an earnest amateur photographer. He began passing

samples of his skill to Peter Rolls, calling out rather loudly the

names of ladies snapshotted. Among them was Winifred Cheylesmore, whom

he had interviewed. She was no more like Winifred Child than Marie

Tempest is like Ethel Barrymore. Consequently Peter gave his ticket

away and sat longer over his dinner than he had meant.
If he had started out even five minutes earlier he would have missed

Jim Logan and the adventure in the shut-up house. He would not have

known that there was hope—indeed, almost a certainty—of finding the

lost dryad in one of New York's great department stores.
He was excited, and would have liked to spend half the night walking

off his superfluous energy in the streets or the park where that lying

beast said he had made Miss Child's acquaintance. Peter would have

felt that he was marching to meet the dawn and that the day he longed

for would come to him sooner if he walked toward the horizon. But

father was in town that night—presumedly at his club, and Peter did

not like to leave mother alone. She had exacted no promise—she never

did exact promises, for that was not her way. Peter had said, however,

that he would motor home after the theatre, and though mother mustn't

sit up, she would know that he was in the house.
He determined to keep to this plan, which, of course, would not

prevent his returning to New York early enough next day for the first

opening of the first shop. He wished there were not so many shops.

Unless luck were with him on his search, he might not reach the dryad

for days.
In spite of all that had happened, midnight was not long past when

Peter tiptoed softly through the quiet house at home and opened the

door of his own den. He had expected to find the room in darkness, but

to his surprise the green-shaded reading lamp on the book-scattered

mahogany table was alight, and there in the horsehair-covered

rocking-chair sat mother with her inevitable work. Close by the window

was wide open, and the night breeze from over the Sound was

rhythmically waving the white dimity curtains.
The sweetness of home-coming swept over Peter with the perfume of

wallflowers which blew in on the wind—a sweetness almost as poignant

as that of fresias. Half unconsciously he had been wishing to see his

mother—perhaps not even to speak, but just to see her placid face in

its kind womanliness. It was almost as if his wish had been whispered

to her telepathically and she had answered it. She made a charming

picture, too, he thought, in the shadowy room where the pale, moving

curtains in the dimness were like spirits bringing peace, and all the

light focussed upon the white-haired, white-gowned woman in the high,

black chair seemed to radiate from her whiteness.
Mother looked up, pleased but not surprised, as the opening door

framed her son.
"Howdy do, deary!" She smiled at him. "I thought you'd be coming along

about this time."
Peter threw his hat and coat at the whale, whose large, shining

surface hospitably received them. Mrs. Rolls's small, plump feet in

cheap Japanese slippers rested upon a "hassock" on whose covering

reposed (in worsted) a black spaniel with blue high lights. This

animal she had herself created before the birth of Peter or Ena, but

it was as bright a beast as if it had been finished yesterday. No one

at Sea Gull Manor except Peter would have given Fido house room. But

he liked the dog, and now sat down on it, lifting his mother's little

feet to place them on his knee.
"You oughtn't to have waited up," he remarked, having kissed her

snow-white hair and both apple-pink cheeks and settled himself more or

less comfortably on Fido.
"I thought I would," she returned placidly. "I like being here. And I

had just this to finish." She held up a wide strip of crocheted lace.

"It's 'most done now. It's go'n' to be a bedspread for Ena. But I

don't know if she––"
Mrs. Rolls did not finish the sentence, but it was a long, long ago

established custom of hers not to finish sentences. Except when alone

with Petro, she seldom made any attempt to bring one to an end. It was

life at Peter senior's side which had got her out of the habit of

trying to complete what she began to say. As he generally interrupted

her when she spoke, even in their early years together, she had almost

unconsciously taken it for granted that he would do so, and stopped

like a rundown mechanical doll at about the place where her

quick-minded husband was due to break in.
Peter junior, who never interrupted (though he, too, had a quick

mind), knew as well as if she had gone on that his mother meant: "I

don't know if Ena will think a homemade coverlet of crocheted lace

smart enough for a real, live marchesa, but I feel I should like to

make my daughter some bridal present with my own hands."
"Oh, yes, she's certain to. It'll be beautiful, if it's anything like

the one you did for me," Petro assured her when the long pause had

told him that mother had no more to add. "Just think of Ena getting

married!"
"Yes, indeed," sighed Mrs. Rolls. "And it seems only a little while

since you were both––"
Peter knew that the missing word was "children." "Anyhow, she's happy,

I think," he reflected aloud, a far-away look in his eyes.
"I guess so," mother agreed. "She'll like real well being a–– I

wish––"
"Marchesa" was easy for Peter to supply mentally, and would have

been much easier for him to pronounce than it was for Mrs. Rolls, who

had had small education in the management even of her native tongue.
She made dear little, cozy, common mistakes in grammar and other

things. Peter adored her mistakes, and Ena was ashamed of them. But in

those good manners which are taught by the heart and not by the head,

no queen could have given Mrs. Rolls lessons.
As for the next sentence, beginning with "I wish—" and ending in the

air, that was more difficult. Even mother, so placid, seemingly so

contented, must have many wishes. And so Petro ventured on a "What?"
"I wisht I could be just as sure you––"
"As sure that I'm happy?"
"Yes, dear."
Peter had been looking at his mother's feet in those blue Japanese

slippers, whose cheapness was rather pathetic. (With all their money,

she never enjoyed wearing expensive things herself. It was as if she

felt lost and un-at-home in them.) But suddenly he glanced up. The

pink-and-white face was as calm as usual, yet her tone had meant

something in particular. A chord seemed to vibrate in his soul, as if

she had softly, yet purposely, touched it with her finger.
"Don't you believe I am happy?" he asked.
"Not—just like you used to be," she said. Their eyes met as she

lifted hers from her work and began rolling it up, finished. She

blushed beautifully, like a girl.
Peter pressed both the little feet between his hands, pressed them

almost convulsively. He did not stop to think how strong his fingers

were, though Logan had had cause to realize their strength two hours

ago. The pressure hurt the small toes so lightly covered. And the

mother of this strong, though slight, young man gloried in the hurt.

She was proud of it, proud of Peter, the one thing in the world she

felt was really hers.
"Mother!" he said in a low, tense voice. "What told you?"
"Why—just bein' your mother, I guess. I was wonderin'––"
"Wondering what?"
"Whether some day you'd say something."
"I wanted to. I wanted to talk to you about—about it all. But I was

afraid it might make you sad. I like to think of you always happy,

dearest. And I couldn't bear to be the one to chase away your smile I

love so much."
"It's thinking of you helps me to smile, Petie," said his mother,

reverting to the pet name of his childhood as she stroked his smooth,

black hair. "If 'twasn't for knowing I've got you—and your loving

me—I do believe I could never smile."
"You're not unhappy?" Peter cried out, startled. It would be a

dreadful pain to know that the placid reserve of this sweet, loved

woman meant unhappiness.
"Not while I have you. But—"
"You must go on, dear. Tell me what you feel. We're here together, all

alone in the night, talking out our hearts. It seems as if it was

meant to be—my finding you waiting here."
"I guess maybe it was, Petie. Something kind of said to me, 'You

wait up for him. He wants you.' And I—why, I always want you, boy."
"Darling! We've got each other fast."
"Thanks be, dear! My! You don't know the times I've sneaked in and set

in this room when you was away. And even now, if you're go'n' to be

out pretty late, I bring in my work 'most always when your pa's out. I

generally slip back to my room before you come in, because I know you

think I oughtn't to be sittin' up. You mightn't just understand that

'twas because this is my only real home."
"Your only real home? Why, Mother!"
"The rest of the house is so big—and so awful new-fashioned and

grand. Not like me a bit," she apologized meekly—but not with the

flurried meekness of her apologies to Peter senior. "Here you've saved

all my dear old things I had in the days before everything was big. I

never can get used to it, and I never will now. It's the bigness, I

guess, that's seemed—somehow—to take your pa and Ena away from

me—long ago. But I've got you. And you let me come here. So I am

happy. I'm a real happy woman, Petie. And I want you to be happy the

way you used to be—or some better way, not all restless like you are

now. I guess if there was some one you loved different from me you

wouldn't make a new life for yourself without a little place in it for

mother, would you—just a weenty little place I could come and live in

sometimes for a while?"
"I'd want you in it always," said Peter. He leaned up and wound his

arms around the plump, formless waist in the neat dressing-gown. "So

would she—if there were a she. I hate the 'bigness,' too—the kind

of false, smart bigness that you mean. We'll have a little house—she

and you and I. For your room will be there, and you'll be in it

whenever father'll spare you. But I'm running away in what I used to

call my 'dreamobile!' I haven't found her yet. That is, I found her

once and lost her again. I'm looking for her now. Mother, do you know

what a 'leitmotif' is?"
"No, dear, indeed I don't. I'm afraid I don't know many of the things

I––"
"There's no reason why you should know this. In Wagner's operas, which

I don't understand, perhaps, but which I love with thrills in my

spine—and that's a kind of understanding—whenever a character

comes on the stage he or she always is followed by a certain strain of

music—music that expresses character, and seems even to describe a

person. Well, wallflower perfume might be your leitmotif. Can't you

hear perfume? I can. Just as you can seem to see music—wonderful,

changing colours. The wallflower scent's all around us now. It's you.

But through it I imagine another perfume. It's here, too. It's been

with me for months. Because I've got to feel it's her spirit, her

leitmotif. The perfume of fresias. Do you know it?"
"I thought maybe she liked it," mother said calmly.
"What put that idea in your darling head?"
"Why, because you've been havin' fresias planted in the garden—and in

your room—as long as they lasted through the spring. You'd never

thought of 'em before as I know of."
"You witch! You notice everything. Who'd believe it, you're so quiet?"
"Of course I notice things about you. I wouldn't be fit to be your

mother if I didn't. Now, do you feel like tellin' me things about

her?"
"I'm longing to," said Peter.
They forgot it was late at night. He told her everything, beginning at

the moment when he had plunged through the dryad door and going on to

the moment when he had lost, not only the girl, but her friendship,

though he said nothing of the Moon dress or the shut-up house. Even

then he did not stop.
"I must have done something inadvertently," he went on, "to make her

stop liking me all of a sudden. For she did like me at first. There

was no flirting or anything silly about it. I felt there was a reason

for her changing, and ever since, every day and every night, I've been

trying to make out what it could have been. I've thought the idea

might come to me. But it never has. That's partly why I'm so anxious

to find her—to make her explain. I was too taken aback, too—sort of

stunned—to go about it the right way when she changed to me at the

last minute there on the dock. Once I could understand, why, I might

start with her again at the beginning and work up. It would give me a

chance—the chance I once thought I had, you know—to try to make her

care. Maybe it would be no use. Maybe I'm not the kind she could ever

like that way, even if things hadn't gone wrong. But—but, Mother,

it's been just agony to think that all this time she's hated me

through some beastly misunderstanding which might easily have been

cleared up."
"My poor boy!" the kind voice soothed him. "I guess that's the worst

pain of all. I knew there was something hurting you, but I didn't

know 'twas as hard a hurt as this. But 'twill come right. I feel it

will—if she's really the right girl."
"She's the only girl!" exclaimed Peter. "You'd love her, and she'd

adore you."
"Tell me just what she looks like," commanded mother, shutting her

eyes to see the picture better.
Peter excelled himself in his description of Winifred Child. "Nobody

ever even dreamed of another girl who looked or talked or acted a bit

like her," he raved. "She's so original!"
"Why, but that's just what somebody did!" mother cried, throwing off

the cloak of her placidity. "Lady Eileen."
"Lady Eileen did what?"
"Dreamed about such a girl. It must have been a real interesting

dream, because she couldn't get it out of her head and told me all

about it. She saw a tall, dark girl, with wonderful eyes and a

fascinating mouth and graceful sort of ways like you've been telling

me about. Hearing Lady Eileen talk was almost like seeing a

photograph. In the dream you were in love with the girl—English she

was, too, like the real one—and ransacking New York for her, while

all the time she—"
"Yes—yes, dear! All the time she––"
"Lady Eileen said particularly I was to tell you about her dream and

let you know she wanted you to hear it, because it seemed kind of

dramatic and made her almost superstitious, it was so real every way.

But she made me promise I wouldn't say a word unless you spoke first

about such a girl as she dreamed of—and told me you loved her and

wanted to find her again. If I began, it would spoil the romance,

and there wouldn't be anything in it. That was how Lady Eileen felt."
Peter listened, but his spirit had rushed on past these explanations.

Lady Eileen had chosen this method of leaving a message for him. It

was a strange method, and he did not understand why she had not

herself told him of the dream. But she was a kind and clever girl, a

true friend. There must have been a good motive for the delay. Loyal

himself, he believed in her loyalty and was grateful. But he could not

stop to think of her now.
"Where did Lady Eileen see my dryad girl—in the dream?" he asked.
"At father's place," said mother simply. "At the Hands."
 
 
CHAPTER XXIV
THINGS EXPLODING
Lily Leavitt did not come back to Mantles next morning. She sent no

word, asked no leave for illness—and the rule at the Hands was

discharge for such an omission. If she appeared again her place would

be filled—unless she had a strong enough "pull" to keep it open.
Win, who arrived promptly, as usual (just as if last night's adventure

had been a black dream) heard the other girls talking about Lily. She

listened and said nothing; had no opinion when asked what she thought.

But not a soul pitied Miss Leavitt. The general idea seemed to be that

she was one "who knew which side her bread was buttered." She would

not be stopping away without notice unless she had done better for

herself. Probably she had secretly married one of those swell beaus

she was always boasting about!
Win, pale and absent-minded (but that might be the heat), was giving

the finishing touches to a cloaked group of figurines when a letter

was brought to her by a messenger boy. It was not yet time for Peter

Rolls's doors to open to the world, but the girl had to finish her

task before reading the note. A glance at the envelope showed Sadie's

handwriting, and as Sadie ought at that moment to have been making

the toilets of dolls upstairs, Win realized that something unexpected

must have happened.
Perhaps Sadie was ill and wanted her to explain to the management. She

must make short shrift with the figurines and be ready to help Sadie

before strenuous life began.
Five minutes later five headless ladies in perfectly draped wraps were

showing off their finery to the best advantage, and their tiring maid

was standing as still as they, an open letter in her hand.
"What's the matter?" asked a pretty, snub-nosed girl who laughed

oftener than Win in these days. "You look as if you'd lost your last

friend."
"I'm afraid—I have," Winifred replied in a strange, withdrawn voice

which made Daisy Thompson's eyes widen.
"Say! I'm real sorry! I hope it ain't your beau."
Win did not answer, because she did not hear. Sadie! Sadie! The dear

little old sardine!
"Good-bye, deerie," she read again. "I coodn't of said this to yure

fase. I only noo for shure yesterdy. Its cunsumsion and they won't

have me back for fere of my giving it to others. I gess thats right

tho its hard luck on me. It aint that I care much about living. I

dont, becawse theres sum one I love who loves another girl. Shes a lot

better than me and werthy of him so thats all right too but it herts

and Id be kind of glad to go out. Dont you be afrade of me doing

anything silly in the tabloyde line tho. I wont. Im no coward. But I

got to leeve this house for the same reeson as the Hands. I mite give

my truble to sum one else. Its a good thing we found out in time. Ive

hurd of a noo plase where they take consumps for nuthing, and Ive got

to steer for it. Its in the country but I wont tell you where deerie

or you mite try to see me and I dont think I cood stand it the way I

feel now. But I love you just as much. Good-by. Yure affecshunate

Sadie."
Win was overwhelmed. Lately she had seen little of her friend. Neither

girl had much time, and the weather had drunk all their energy. She

ought to have guessed from Sadie's thinness that she was ill. She

ought—oh, she ought to have done a dozen things that she had not

done! Now it was too late.
But no, it mustn't be too late! She would find out where Sadie was. It

ought to be easy, for the verdict which had sent the girl away from

the Hands must have been that of a young doctor who attended the

employees. There were certain hours when he came to the hospital room

which Win had seen on her first day at Peter Rolls's. One of these

hours was just before the opening of the shop. Perhaps he hadn't yet

got away.
The floorwalker who controlled Mantles was one of the smartest men in

any department, somewhat of a martinet, but inclined to be reasonable

with those who had any "gumption." Miss Child had gumption, and though

it was nearly time for the public to rush in (there was a bargain sale

that day) he gave her a permit of absence.
"Nothing worse than a headache, I hope, takes you to the H.R.?" he

questioned, scrawling his powerful name. "We need everybody to get

busy to-day."
"I'm going to beg for some sal volatile," answered Win, and

determined to do so, as even white fibs were horrid little things,

almost as horrid as cowardly, scuttling black beetles.
Poor Sadie had giggled the other night: "You stick even to the truth

this hot weather!"
The doctor had not gone, but he did not know of the new place Sadie

referred to, and, not knowing, didn't believe in its existence. He had

told Sadie Kirk yesterday that her lungs were infected and that she

had become "contagious." Of course she had had to be discharged. These

things were sad, but they were a part of the day's work. It was a pity

that Miss Kirk hadn't been longer with the Hands. Her insurance money

wouldn't amount to much.
"Do you mean to say that they've sent her away to die and haven't

given her anything?" Win gasped.
"Not to die, I hope," said young Dr. Marlow. "She's curable. But she

wouldn't get more than a week's salary with her discharge, I'm afraid.

Old Saint Peter isn't in this business for his health."
"Or for any one else's," the girl retorted.
Marlow shrugged his shoulders, bowed slightly to the pretty but

unreasonable young woman, and went away.
Winifred also should have gone. She had got her sal volatile and her

information. But life was lying in ruins around her—Sadie's life, if

not her own—and she did not know how to set about reconstructing it.
"What man does she love who loves another girl?" she asked herself.
Then, suddenly, she knew. It was Earl Usher, and he loved her,

Winifred, who could never be more to him than a friend.
Win had heard of a "vicious circle." It seemed that she and Sadie and

Ursus were travelling in one, going round and round, and could never

get out.
"But I must go down," the mechanical part of herself kept repeating.
She had involuntarily paused near the door to think things out in

peace. There were no patients for the two narrow white beds, and the

nurse—a small, nervous woman with sentimental eyes—was heating water

over a spirit lamp. She suffered from headache and had prescribed

herself some tea. The water had begun to boil, and despite the

throbbing in her temples she hummed monotonously: "You Made Me Love

You."
Winifred heard the tune through her thoughts of Sadie and Earl Usher,

and it seemed to make everything sadder and more hopeless. But

suddenly the singing broke off—the thin voice rose to a shriek, and

was lost in a loud explosion.
In the act of going out Win turned, bewildered and expecting horror.

Head down, her hands covering her burned face, the nurse came

staggering toward the door. Hair and cap were on fire. All over the

white dress and apron were dotted little blue tongues of flame that

had spouted out from the bursting lamp.
Often such an accident had been lightly prophesied by this very woman.

The spirit sent up for the hospital was of the cheapest. Peter Rolls

was "not in business for his health!"
Dazed by the deafening noise, and shocked to the very heart by the

woman's shriek of pain, Win was not conscious of thought. She did not

tell herself to spring to the nearest bed, tear off the covering,

stop the nurse before she could rush wildly into the corridor, and

wrap her in the blanket. All she knew for a moment was that she had

done and was doing these things, that she was using her strength to

hold the maddened creature, and all the while calling out for help.
The doctor had not yet reached the end of the long corridor, and the

explosion and cries brought him and others running. Vaguely Win was

conscious that there were women there, maids who cleaned floors and

windows, and that there were two or three men besides Dr. Marlow. She

thought that he ordered some of them out and gave directions to

others, but the scene sharpened into detail only when she heard

herself told to stay and give assistance.
She aiding the doctor, the nurse's burns were dressed. The little

quivering creature, hastily undressed, was put to bed, face, head,

arms, and hands covered with oil and bandaged. It was not until

another nurse—telephoned for from somewhere to somewhere—had

arrived, and the invalid had been given an opiate, that Win realized

the tingling pain in her own fingers.
"Why, yes, so I am burned a little!" she exclaimed when the doctor

asked to see her hands. "But it's nothing to matter. I can go back to

work now. Nurse is all right."
"No, it's nothing to matter, and you can go back to work, all right,"

briskly echoed Marlow, who was no coddler of any hands at Peter

Rolls's; "that is, you can when I've patched you up a bit. And nurse

isn't going to be bad, either. She won't be disfigured, I can

guarantee that—thanks to you."
"Thanks to me?" Win echoed.
"Yes, just that. Perhaps you don't realize that you probably saved her

life."
"No. I—I don't think I've realized anything yet." She found herself

suddenly wanting to cry, but remembered a day on the Monarchic (as

she always did remember if tears felt near) and swallowed the rising

lump in her throat.
"Well, don't bother about it. You can get conceited later. Here, drink

this to quiet your nerves in case you feel jumpy, and now run along.

It'll be all right for you downstairs. The news will have got to your

dep by this time and they'll know why you're late."
Win "ran along" and found the doctor's prophecy correct The news had

bounded ahead of her.
"I hear you've been distinguishing yourself," said Mr. Wellby, the

floorwalker. "Let's see your hands. Oh, I guess they won't put you out

of business, a brave girl like you."
"I'm as well as ever, thank you," said Win.
Stupid of her, wanting to cry again just because people were paying

her compliments! But perhaps she hadn't quite got over last night and

not sleeping at all. And then Sadie's letter. Things had piled on top

of each other, but she mustn't let herself go to pieces. She must keep

her wits and think—think—think how to get at Sadie and what to do

for her.
Dr. Marlow had covered Win's fingers with something he called

"newskin," since it would not do for a "saleslady" to disgust

customers by serving them with bandaged hands. It was like a

transparent varnish and made her nails shine as brightly as those of

the vainest girls who spent all their spare time in polishing. But the

redness showed through, as if her hands were horribly chapped. She saw

a lady who had asked her to try on a white lace evening coat staring

at them.
"What's the matter with your hands?" The question came sharply.
"I scalded them a little this morning," Win explained.
"Oh! I'm glad it isn't a disease."
The girl blushed faintly, ashamed, glanced down at the offending pink

fingers, and turning slowly round to display the cloak, suddenly

looked up into the eyes of Peter Rolls.
She could not help starting and drawing in her breath. For half a

second her brain whirled and she thought that she imagined him, that

it was just such another vision as those of last night when she had

put on the Moon dress.
His eyes were looking at her as they had looked then, and they were

the good blue eyes of Mr. Balm of Gilead. It could not be that he was

really here gazing at her. It must be some other man like him. But no!

He had taken off his hat. He was saying something in the well

remembered—too well remembered!—voice.
"How do you do, Miss Child? When you've finished with this lady, I

shall be so much obliged if you can speak to me for a minute."
She bowed her head—quite a polite, ordinary sort of bow, just like

that of any well-trained saleslady to a prospective customer intending

to wait till she was free. But really it did not mean politeness at

all. It meant that she had to hide her face, and that it was taking

every square inch of nerve force she had to behave in the least like

a saleslady.
It was seeing Peter Rolls suddenly—Peter Rolls in flesh and bone and

muscle and magnetism of eyes, which told her in a devastating flash a

thing about herself she had feared for months—ever since the day she

turned her back upon Mr. Balm of Gilead and the Monarchic.
She was in love with him. Hideously, desperately, overwhelmingly in

love with him, just as ridiculous girls always were with men they

oughtn't to think of. Probably he had tried to make her so at first

with his friendly, chivalrous ways that hid blacknesses underneath.
She had escaped, thanks to his sister. And it looked as if those

horrid hints had indeed been true, otherwise he would not have

troubled to persist after his snubbing. For he had persisted. Some

glint of blue light in the steady eyes told her that. This was not a

coincidence. Mr. Rolls had the air of having found her at last. She

must make him sorry for it. Because, after her experience of the other

man who had persisted—though she thought herself forgotten—why

should she hope against hope that this man was different?
At last the customer, who did not hurry in the least—rather the

contrary—wore all excuses for lingering to shreds, she waddled fatly

away, carrying the lace cloak with her; and Win, not shirking the

ordeal as she had done when Jim Logan haunted Toyland, turned to Peter

Rolls.
 
 
CHAPTER XXV
A PIECE OF HER MIND
"Miss Child, I've been looking for you for months!" were Peter's first

words when he had her to himself.
Instantly she knew what her pose ought to be. Not prim stiffness, not

suspicious maidenly dignity, but just smiling civility, a recognition

of past slight acquaintance. This would do for the beginning. This

must surely show him that the tactics Ena credited him with were

useless here.
"Have you? How nice of you to say so," she braced herself to reply

with gayest indifference. "Well, I've been in this store for—a long

time, migrating from one department to another and learning the

business. I'm quite a fair saleswoman now, I assure you. Are you going

to buy a cloak? Because, if not—this is a busy morning."
"Yes, I'll buy one as a present for my mother," said Peter. "I should

like you to choose her something. I described her to you once, but I

suppose you've forgotten. She's little, and rather plump, and has

beautiful white hair and a rosy complexion. But, Miss Child, I want to

talk to you, not about cloaks, about yourself. I've asked permission,

and they know who I am, and it's all right. I said you and my sister

were friends. That's true, isn't it?"
"Oh, yes!"
"I believed we were friends once. And we were, too. The more I've

thought of it, the surer I've been. Something happened to make you

change your mind about me. I was struck all of a heap at first. I

didn't have the sense to know what to say or do, to try and put myself

back where I had been. I let you go. And I lost you. But I'm not going

to lose you again. You can see how much in earnest I am when I tell

you that I haven't stopped looking for you for one single day after I

realized you wouldn't keep your promise about writing my sister."
"It wasn't a promise," breathed Win. "I—never meant to write to her."
"I thought so!"
"Why should I? It was very kind of Miss Rolls to suggest it, if I

should ever want help. But I didn't want help. All I wanted was to get

on by myself."
"I know you mean me to understand from that, Miss Child, that you

don't think I've any right to force myself on you after you showed me

so plainly you thought me a bounder," said Peter, not mincing his

words or stumbling over them. "But I'm not a bounder. There must be

some way of proving to you that I'm not. That's why I'm here for one

thing, though there's another––"
"What?" Winifred threw in, frightened, and thinking it better to cut

him short in time.
"I want you to meet my mother and let her help you to get some kind of

a position more—more worthy of your talents than this."
Win laughed aloud. "You run down your father's shop?"
"It's not good enough for you."
She flushed, and all her pent-up anger against the House of the Hands

tingled in that flush.
"You say so because I once had the great honour of being an

acquaintance of yours—and your sister's," she hurried breathlessly

on. "For all the rest of the people here, the people you don't know

and don't want to know, you think it good enough—too good,

perhaps—even splendid! It does look so, doesn't it? Magnificent! And

every one of your father's employees so happy—so fortunate to be

earning his wages. They're worms—that doesn't matter to rich men like

you, Mr. Rolls. Unless, perhaps, a girl happens to be pretty—or you

knew her once and remember that she was an individual. Oh, you must

feel I'm very ungrateful for your interest. Maybe you mean to be

kind—about your mother. But give your interest to those who need it.

I don't. I've seen your name in the papers—interviews—things you try

to do for the 'poor.' It's a sort of fad, isn't it—in your set? But

charity begins at home. You could do more by looking into things and

righting wrongs in your father's own shop than anywhere else in the

world."
She stopped, panting a little, her colour coming and going She had not

meant this at first. It was far removed from smiling civility,

this—tirade! But, as Sadie Kirk would say, "He had asked for it."
He was looking at her with his straight, level gaze. He was

astonished, maybe, but not angry. And she did not know whether to be

glad or sorry that she had not been able to rouse him to rage. His

look into her eyes was no longer that of a young man for a young

woman who means much to him. That light had died while the stream of

her words poured out.
For a moment, when she had ceased, they stared at each other in

silence, his face very grave, hers flushed and suggesting a

superficial repentance.
"Forgive me," she plumped two words into the pause, as if pumping air

into a vacuum. "I oughtn't to have said all that. It was rude."
"But true? You think it's true?"
"Yes."
"You have been working here in my father's store for months, and you

say I could do more good by righting the wrongs here than anywhere

else in the world. That sounds pretty serious."
"It is serious. Whether I ought to have spoken or not."
"I tell you, you ought to have spoken. It was—brave of you. That's

the way I always think of you, Miss Child, being brave—whatever

happens. And laughing."
"I don't laugh now."
"Not at other people's troubles—I know. But you would at your own."
"I'm not thinking of my own. To-day of all days!"
He wondered what she meant. His mind flashed swiftly back to last

night and all that had happened. He could have kissed the hem of her

black dress to see her here, safe and vital enough to fling reproaches

at him for his sins—of omission. Yet he must stand coldly discussing

grievances. No, "coldly" was not the word. No word could have been

less appropriate to the boiling emotions under Peter Rolls's grave,

composed manner.
He let the baffling sentence go—a sentence which framed thoughts of

Sadie Kirk.
"I should like to hear from you the specific wrongs you want righted,"

he said. "I know a girl of your sort wouldn't speak vaguely. You do

mean something specific."
"Yes—I do."
"Then tell me—now."
"You came to buy a cloak for your mother."
"I didn't come for that, and you know it. I came for you. But you put

a shield between us to keep me off. When you have emptied your heart

of some of these grievances that are making it hot—against me, maybe

you won't have to put me at the same distance. Maybe you'll let me be

your friend again, if I can deserve it."
"I don't want to talk or think of ourselves at all!" she broke out.
"I don't ask you to. All that—and my mother's cloak, too—you needn't

be getting down that box!—can wait. If you won't be my friend, anyhow

show me how to help your friends."
"Oh, if you would do that!" Win cried.
"I will. Give me the chance."
Despite his injunction, she had taken from its neat oak shelf a box of

summer wraps and placed it on the counter behind which she stood. Now,

not knowing what she did, she lifted the cardboard cover and seemed to

peep in at the folds of chiffon and silk.
Peter looked not at the box, but at her pitiful, reddened hands on the

lid. The blood mounted slowly to his temples and he bit his lip. He,

too, was standing, though any one of several green velvet-covered

stools was at his service. He turned away, leaning so much weight on

the bamboo stick he held that it bent and rather surprised him.
Suddenly the scene struck him as very strange, almost unreal—Winifred

Child, his lost dryad, found in his father's store, separated from him

by a dignified barrier of oak and many other things invisible! This

talk going on between them—after last night! The hum of women's

voices in the distance (they kept their distance in this vast

department because he was Peter Rolls, Jr., as all the employees by

this time knew) and the heavy heat and the smell of oak seemed to add

to the unreality of what was going on. Fresias would have helped. But

there was nothing here that suggested help—unless you wanted advice

about a cloak.
Win had been marshalling her ideas like an army hastily assembled to

fight in the dark.
"That is a favour I couldn't refuse to take from you, even if I

would," she said in a low voice, "to help my friends."
"It is no favour. You'll be doing me that."
She went on as if he had not spoken.
"I don't know about any shops in New York except this one—only things

I've heard. Some of the girls I've met here have worked in other

department stores. They say—this is one of the worst. I have to tell

you that—now I've begun. There's no use keeping it back—or you won't

understand how I feel. There are real abuses. The Hands don't break

the laws—that's all. About hours—we close at the right time, but the

salespeople are kept late, often very late, looking over stock. Not

every night for the same people, but several times a week. We have

seats, but we mustn't use them. It would look as if we were lazy—or

business were bad. We 'lend' the management half the time we're

allowed for meals on busy days—and never have it given back. The

meals themselves served in the restaurant—the dreadful

restaurant—seem cheap, but they ought to be cheaper, for they're

almost uneatable. Those of us who can't go out get ptomain poisoning

and appendicitis. I know of cases. Hardly any of us can afford enough

to eat on our salaries. I should think our blood must be almost white!
"But nobody here cares how we live out of business hours, so long as

we're 'smart' and look nice. When we aren't smart—because we're

ill, perhaps—and can't any longer look nice—because we're getting

older or are too tired to care—why, then we have to go; poor,

worn-out machines—fit for the junk shop, not for a department store!

Even here, in Mantles, where we get a commission, the weak ones go to

the wall. We must be like wolves to make anything we can save for a

rainy day. But any girl or man who'll consent to act the spy on

others—there's a way to earn money, lots of it. A few are tempted.

They must degenerate more and more, I think! And there are other

things that drive some of us—the women, I mean—to desperation. But I

can't tell you about them. You must find out for yourself—if you

care."
"If I care!" echoed Peter.
"If you do, why haven't you found out all these things, and more, long

ago?" she almost taunted him, carried away once again by the thought

of those she championed—the "friends" she had not come to in her

story yet.
"Because—my father made it a point that I should keep my hands off

the Hands. That was the way he put it. I must justify myself far

enough to tell you that."
"But—if one's in earnest, need one take no for an answer?"
"I suppose I wasn't in earnest enough. I thought I was. But I couldn't

have been. You're making me see that now."
"I haven't told you half!"
"Then—go on."
"You really wish it?"
"Yes."
"The floorwalkers and others above them have power that gives them the

chance to be horribly unjust and tyrannical if they like. There are

lots of fine ones. But there are cruel and bad ones, too. And then—I

can't tell you what life is like for the under dog! And cheating goes

on that we all see and have to share in—sales of worthless things

advertised to attract women. We get a premium for working off 'dead

stock.' Each department must be made to pay, separately and on its own

account, you see, whatever happens! And that's why each one is its own

sweatshop––"
"I swear to you this isn't my father's fault," involuntarily Peter

broke in. "He's not young any more, you see, and he worked so hard in

his early years that he's not strong enough to keep at it now. Not

since I can remember has he been able to take a personal interest in

the store, except from a distance. He leaves it to others, men he

believes that he can trust. Not coming here himself, he––"
"Why, he comes nearly every day!" Win cried out, then stopped

suddenly at sight of Peter's face.
"I—am sure you're mistaken about that one thing, Miss Child," he

said. "You must have been misinformed. They must have told you some

one else was he––"
The girl was silent, but Peter's eyes held hers, and the look she gave

him told that she was not convinced. "You don't believe me?" he asked.
"I believe you don't know. He does come. It's always been toward the

closing hour when I've seen him. The first time he was pointed out to

me was by a floorwalker on Christmas Eve. I was in the toy department

then. He was with Mr. Croft. How strange you didn't know!"
"If it was father—perhaps I can guess why he didn't want us to find

out. But even now I—well, I shall go home and ask him if he realizes

what is happening here. Somehow I shall help your friends, Miss

Child."
"I haven't told you about them yet," Win said. "It was really one

friend who was in my mind. There may be ever so many others just as

sad as she. But I love her. I can't bear to have her die just because

she's poor and unimportant—except to God. Dr. Marlow thinks she's

curable. Only—the things she needs she can't afford to get, and I

haven't any money left to buy them for her; just my salary, and no

more. There's one thing I can do, though! I'll learn to be a wolf,

like some of the others, and snatch commissions."
"Don't do that!" Peter smiled at her sadly. "I shouldn't like to think

of you turning into a wolf. Your friend is sick––"
"She was told by the doctor yesterday that it was a case of

consumption. I had a letter from her this morning—bidding me

good-bye. You see, she was discharged on the spot, with only a week's

wages."
"Beastly!" exclaimed Peter. "There ought to be some kind of a

convalescent home in connection with this store—or two, rather, one

for contagious sort of things and the other not. I––"
"She wrote in her letter that she'd heard of a place where

consumptives were taken in and treated free," Win went on when he

paused. "But she wouldn't tell me where it was. And Dr. Marlow says

there is nothing of the sort––"
"Oh, he can't have read the newspapers these last few days. It's been

open a week."
"Then you know about it?"
"Yes. You see—it's a sort of—friend of mine who's started the

scheme. The house is not very big yet. But he'll enlarge it if it

makes a success."
"Quite free?"
"Yes. Anybody can come and be examined by the doctor. No case will be

refused while there's room. I—my friend lost his dearest friend years

ago—a boy of his own age then—from consumption. It almost broke his

heart. And he made up his mind that when he grew up and had a little

money of his own, he'd start one of those open-air places in the

country free."
"I believe you're speaking of yourself!" exclaimed Win, her face

lighting. Then Ena Rolls's brother couldn't be all bad!
"Well, I'm in the business, too. This must be the place the girl is

going to. She shall be cured, I promise you. And when she's well she

shall have work in the country to keep her strong and make her happy.

Will that please you?"
"Yes," Win answered. "But—it doesn't please me to feel you're doing

it for that reason."
"I'm not. Only partly, at least. I'm thankful for the chance to help.

And this shan't be all. There'll be other ways. Please don't think too

badly of me, Miss Child. I trusted my father, as he wished. And he

trusts Mr. Croft—too completely, I fear."
Again Win was silent. She had heard things about Peter Rolls, Sr.,

which made her fancy that he was not a man to trust any one but

himself. And she did not yet dare to trust his son. The look was

coming back into his eyes which made her remember that he was a man

like other men. Yet it was hard not to trust him! And because it was

so hard she grew afraid.
"Give me the address of that convalescent home," she broke her own

silence by saying. "I want to write to my friend, Sadie Kirk—and go

to see her—if she's really there. Mr. Rolls, I shall bless you if she

is cured."
Petro had taken out his cardcase and was writing.
"Then, sooner or later, I shall have my blessing," he said quietly.

"Couldn't you give me just a small first instalment of it now?

Couldn't you tell me what changed you toward me on the ship? Had it

anything to do with my family—any gossip you heard?"
"In a way, yes. But I can't possibly tell you. Please don't ask me."
"I won't. But give me some hope that I can live it down. You see, I

can't spare you out of my life. I had you in it only a few days. Yet

those days have made all the difference."
Win stiffened.
"I can't let you talk to me like that," she said almost sharply, if

her creamy voice could be sharp. "I hate it. You'll make me wish—for

my own sake—if it weren't for my friend, I mean—that you hadn't

found me here. I thought—I don't see why I shouldn't say it!—when I

asked for work in your father's store that none of the family would

ever come near the place. I was told they never did. But it wasn't

true. You all come!"
"You mean my father and I?"
"And Miss Rolls, too––"
"She came?"
"Yes, with Lord Raygan, and—and I think you and Lady Eileen were

here, too."
"We were," Peter said. "And so—you were in the store even then?

Nobody told me."
"I hoped they wouldn't."
It was his turn to be silent, understanding Eileen's dream. Raygan

must have talked to her about the girl. But there would have been

nothing to say, if Ena had not said it first. Ena had "explained

things" to Raygan, perhaps—and then––
An old impression came back to Peter. He remembered Ena's protest

against his friendship for a "dressmaker," and her kindness later. He

remembered asking himself on the dock if Ena could have made mischief.

He had put the thought away as treacherous, not once, but many times.

Now he did not put it away. He faced it, and wondered if he could

ever forgive his sister. It seemed at that moment that he never could.
"Will you choose the cloak for Mrs. Rolls?" Win was asking in the

professional tone of the obliging young saleswoman.
"I—er—yes, I suppose so. Which one do you suggest?"
"Any of these would be charming for—the lady you've described. She'd

like it better, I'm sure, if you chose it yourself."
"No, I want you to choose, please. I've already told her about you. If

it hadn't been for her I shouldn't have found you so soon. She advised

me to try the Hands. No matter what you may think of me, there's only

one opinion to have of mother. And you can't object to meeting her.

You choose the cloak and I'll bring her to see you—in it."
Win kept her eyes on the assortment of silk motoring and dust coats

which she had arranged on the broad counter for Mr. Rolls's

inspection. Suddenly a great weight was lifted from her head, as if

kind hands had gently removed a tight helmet.
Would such a man as Ena Rolls had sketched in her shadow portrait of a

brother bring his mother to meet a shop girl whom he fancied? It

seemed not. Yet men of that type were the cleverest, as she already

knew. Maybe he didn't really mean to bring Mrs. Rolls. It would be

easy, from time to time, to postpone her visit. And Win was very

proud. She thought of Ena's annoyance at happening upon her in the

elevator, and how reluctantly Miss Rolls had taken up the cue of

cordiality from Lord Raygan. Oh, it was best—in any case—it was the

only way to keep personalities out of her intercourse with the man who

had once been Mr. Balm of Gilead.
"This silver gray is one of the prettiest of the new wraps," she

glibly advertised her wares.
"Very well, if you like it, I'll marry—I mean, I'll take it. Tell me

how you hurt your hands."
"There's nothing to tell," she put him off again, visibly freezing—an

intellectual feat in such weather. "And—really, as I said before, I

don't care to talk about myself."
Her look, even more than her words, shut Peter up. The cloak saved the

situation during a few frigid seconds. But as a situation it had

become strained. The only hope for the future was to go now. And Peter

went. He went straight back to Sea Gull Manor and to his father.
 
 
CHAPTER XXVI
WHEN THE SECRET CAME OUT
Father was in the library when Peter got home. One did not open the

door and walk straight into this sacred room. One knocked, and if

father happened to be engaged in any pursuit which he did not wish the

family eye to see, he had time to smuggle it away and take up a

newspaper, or even a book, before calling out "Come in."
To-day, not being well, he was allowing himself the luxury of a

jig-saw puzzle, but as he considered the amusement frivolous for a man

of his position, at the sound of his son's voice he hustled the board

containing the half-finished picture into a drawer of his roll-top

desk. In order to be doing something, he caught up a paper. It was

Town Tales, and his eye, searching instinctively for the name of

Rolls, saw that of the Marchese di Rivoli coupled with it and a

slighting allusion. A wave of physical weakness surged over the

withered man as he asked himself if he had done wrong in sanctioning

his daughter's engagement to the Italian.
"What do you want?" he greeted Petro testily.
He was invariably testy when indigestion had him in its claw, and his

tone gave warning that this was a bad moment Still Petro was bursting

with his subject. He could not bear to postpone the fight. Instead of

putting it off, he resolved to be exceedingly careful in his tactics.
"I want to talk with you, Father, if you don't mind," he began

pleasantly. "I hope I'm not interrupting anything important?"
"I am supposed to be left to myself in the mornings," said Peter

senior, martyrized. "Though I don't go to the store, I must read

Croft's reports and keep in touch with things."
"It's about the store I'd like to talk." Peter was thankful for this

opening. He perched hesitatingly on the arm of an adipose easy chair,

not having been specifically invited to sit.
"Why, what have you got to say about the Hands?" Defiance underlay

tone and look.
"It was in this very room I promised you I'd keep my hands off the

Hands," Peter quoted. "But I want you to let me take the promise

back."
"I'll do nothing of the sort!" shrilled Peter senior. "What do you

mean?"
"I need to work. I've tried other things, but my thoughts always come

back to the Hands. I'm proud of your success you know. I want to—to

batten on it. And I want to carry it on. I have ideas of my own."
"I bet you have, and damned poor ideas, too," snapped the old man.

"I'm not going to have them tried in my place while I'm alive."
"Let me tell you what some of them are, won't you, before you condemn

them?" his son pleaded, refusing to be ruffled.
"No. I won't have my time wasted on any such childishness," growled

Peter senior. "You ought to know better than to trouble me with every

silly, trifling idea you get into your head."
"To me this is not trifling," Peter argued. "It's so serious that if

you refuse to take me into your business—I don't care how humble a

position you start me—I shall begin to make my own way in the world.

I can't go on as I am, living on you, with an allowance that comes out

of the Hands, unless you give me some hope that I can soon work up to

having a voice in the management."
"I suppose what you are really hinting at is a bigger allowance under

a different name," sneered old Peter. "Now you're turning

socialist—oh, you don't suppose I'm blind when I come to your name

and your quixotic schemes in the newspapers! You don't like the

red-hot chaps raving about 'unearned increment,' or whatever they call

it."
"No, it isn't that," Peter said simply. "I don't much care what people

say, so long as I can help things along a bit; though, of course, I'd

rather it would be with my money than yours, no matter how generous

you are about giving and asking no questions. I don't ask for more, or

want it. But I do want to feel that—forgive me, Father!—I do want to

feel that on the money I handle there's no sweat wrung out of men's

bodies or tears from women's eyes."
Peter senior had sat only half turned from his desk, as if suggesting

to Peter junior that the sooner he was allowed to get back to work,

the better. But at these last words, unexpected as a blow, he swung

violently round in his revolving chair to glare at the young man.
"Well, I'm damned!" he ejaculated.
Peter sincerely hoped not, but felt that silence was safer than

putting his hopes into words.
"This comes of turning socialist! You insult your father who supports

you in luxury––"
"I don't mean to insult you, Father, and I don't want to be supported

in luxury. I want to work for every cent I have. I want to work hard."
"I never thought," Peter senior reflected aloud, abruptly changing his

tone, "to hear a son of mine spout this sort of cheap folderol, and I

never thought that any one of my blood would be weak enough to come

crawling and begging to break a solemn promise."
"It means strength, not weakness, to break some promises—the kind

that never ought to have been made," Peter junior defended himself.

"I'd break it without crawling or begging if I thought you'd prefer,

except that it would be no use. Unless I had your permission, I

couldn't get taken into the Hands."
"Well, you don't get it. See?" retorted the head of the Hands as

rudely as he could ever have spoken in old days to his humblest

subordinate.
"Then, Father, if that's your last word on the subject," said Petro,

rising, "this means for you and me, where business is concerned, the

parting of the ways."
The old man's sallow face was slowly, darkly suffused with red.

"You're trying to bully me," he grunted. "But I'm not taking any

bluff."
"You misjudge me." Petro still kept his temper. "I'd be a disgusting

cad to try on such a game with you, and I don't think I am that. I'm

more thankful than I can tell you for all you've done for me. You've

had a hard life yourself, and you've secured me an easy one. You never

had time to see the world, but you let me see it because I longed

to—when I saw you had no use for me in the business. You let me give

money away and, thanks to your generosity, one or two schemes I had at

heart are in working order already. There's enough saved out of my

allowance for the last few years to see them through, if I never take

another cent from you. And I never will, from this day on, Father,

while you run the Hands on present lines."
"You're a blank idiot!" snarled the old man; but a strained, almost

frightened look was stretched in queer lines on his yellow face. He

was thinking of Ena and of the newspapers. He could hear the dogs

yapping round his feet.
"Young Peter Rolls breaks away from home. Earns his living with his

own hands, not father's Hands. What he says about his principles"—or

some such rot as that would certainly appear in big, black headlines

just when Ena and her magnificent marchese were searching the

columns for gush over the forthcoming marriage. It would spoil the

girl's pleasure in her wedding.
Old Peter was furious with young Peter, but began angrily to realize

that the matter was indeed serious. He desired to be violent, but fear

of Ena dashed cold water on the fire of his rage. Against his will and

against his nature he began to temporize, meaning later to revenge his

present humiliation upon his son.
"Who the devil has been upsetting you with lies about the Hands?" he

spluttered.
"I'm afraid we must take for granted that what has 'upset' me isn't

lies." Peter let his sadness show in face and voice. "I don't wonder

you're surprised and perhaps angry at my coming to you and suddenly

throwing out some sort of accusations, when year after year I've been

receiving money from the Hands as meek as a lamb without a word or

question. I don't defend myself for lack of interest in the past or

for too much now. Maybe I'm to blame both ways. But please remember,

Father, you said that unless I distrusted you, I was to stand aside.

After that I was so anxious to prove I trusted you all right, that I

hurried to promise before I'd stopped to think. Since then I've been

made to think—furiously to think—and––"
"I was brought up to believe there was no excuse for breaking a

promise," Peter senior cut him short severely. There was Petro's

chance to score, and—right or wrong—he took it.
"Then things have changed since the days when you were being brought

up," he said, with one of those straight, clear looks old Peter had

always disliked as between son and father. "Because, you know you

promised Ena you would give up going to the store except for important

business meetings once or twice a year. And you haven't given it up.

You go there nearly every night."
Peter senior physically quailed. His great secret was found out! No

use to bluster. Somehow young Peter had got hold of the long-hidden

truth. He was, in a way, at the fellow's mercy. If Petro chose to tell

Ena this thing she would fancy that every one except the family knew

how old Peter's grubbing habits had never been shaken off; that with

him once a shopkeeper, always a shopkeeper, and that behind her back

people must be laughing at the difference between her aristocratic

airs and her father's commonness.
The old man's stricken face shocked Peter. He was as much ashamed of

himself as if he had kicked his father.
"I oughtn't to have told you, I know," he stammered. "Anyhow, not like

this. I'm sorry."
Peter senior gathered himself together and feebly bluffed.
"You needn't be sorry," he blustered in a thin voice at the top of his

throat. "What do I care whether you know or not? There's no disgrace

in looking after my own business, I guess! To please Ena, I've made a

sort of secret of it, that's all. I never 'promised.' I only let her

and other folks it didn't concern suppose I lived in idleness, like

the lords they admire so much. No harm in that! As for you, you're

welcome to know what I do with my time when I go to New York. But it's

none of your business, all the same, and you'd better keep still about

it, or you'll regret your meddling. Who told you? That's what I want

to get at. Who stuffed you up to the neck with all that damned

nonsense about 'sweat and tears?' I bet it's the same man who tried to

blackmail me with my own son about my going to the Hands nights."
"It wasn't a man who told me," said Peter, "it was a woman—or,

rather, a girl. It was me she was blaming, not you. She thought I

was responsible for the wrongs she and other employees suffer from.

She didn't know it was a secret, your visiting the place. She simply

mentioned it as a fact––"
"And you, a son of mine, stood quietly listening to abuse of your

father and the house that's made his fortune—his fortune and

yours—from a pert young clerk in his store!"
At last Peter senior could speak with the voice of injured virtue. He

could reach Peter junior with the well-deserved lash of reproach. But

no! The lash striking out, touched air.
"Father, I listened because I love the girl," Peter answered "Wait,

please! Let me explain. I fell in love with her on the Monarchic.

Then something happened and I lost sight of her. Yesterday I found her

at the Hands. I wanted to talk to her about love, but she made me

listen to her instead. She said sharp things about the store that cut

like knives. Don't think I'm accusing you if the Hands is a

sweatshop. You trust Croft, and he's abused his trust. That must be

it. For God's sake, give me a chance to help you put things straight."
For a moment—a long moment—Peter senior did not speak, and Peter

junior would have given much to know where his thoughts had gone. They

were away somewhere—with the Hands or with the girl who had made

Petro listen.
"Will you do it, Father? Will you give me a chance?" his son repeated.
Old Peter started. "Old Peter" seemed the only name that fitted him

just then.
"One of my children is going to marry a marquis and the other wants to

marry a clerk behind my counters," he almost whimpered.
Then Petro knew, without telling, which direction his father's

thoughts had taken.
"Don't be afraid that she isn't a lady," the young man humoured the

old man's prejudices. "She's English and beautiful and clever and

brave. She saved a woman from being burned to death to-day at the

Hands. She didn't tell me that story, but I heard it. God made her to

be a princess. Misfortune put her behind a counter in our store. Oh,

no! not misfortune. Though she's had a hard time at the Hands, and

shows it in her face, I believe she'd say herself that she's glad of

the experience. And if through her those that have suffered wrong from

us can be––"
"Don't talk to me any more about all this just now, my son," Peter

senior suddenly implored rather than commanded "You've given me a

shock—several shocks. I—I'm not fit for 'em to-day, I guess. I told

you I wasn't well. I'm feeling bad. I'm feeling mighty bad."
His looks confirmed his words. In the last few moments since the angry

flush had passed, the old man's face had faded to a sicklier yellow

than Petro had ever seen upon it—except one day, long ago, when Peter

Rolls, Sr., had tried to be a yachtsman in order to please Ena—and

the weather had been unkind. The young man was stabbed by remorse.

Reason told him that now was the moment to press his point home. But

compassion bade him withdraw it from the wound. It was true that his

father was not well and had warned him of the fact at the beginning of

their conversation. Petro had gone too far.
"I'm sorry, Father," he apologized. "I meant to stir you up, but I

didn't mean to give you a shock. Shall I ring? Is there anything you

want?"
"Only to be alone," replied the other. "I'll lie down here on the

sofa. By and by, if I don't feel better, I'll go to my room maybe and

make it dark and sleep this headache off. I don't remember when I've

been so bad. But don't say anything to your mother."
"You mean about your going to the Hands? She knows about the girl."
"No, I mean about my head. I don't care whether or no your mother

hears that I go to the Hands. It's Ena and outside folks I care for,

and them only for Ena's sake. She's so proud! And when she gets home

from France––"
"Not a word to her, I promise. Nor to any one outside. But do you

know, I believe mother would be glad to hear that you sometimes go to

the store? She'd think it was like old times. And she loves the old

times."
"Tell your mother anything you like. She's got a still tongue in her

head." Peter senior gasped out his words with the desperate air of a

man at the end of his tether. "Only go now—go, and let my head rest.

You and I can discuss all these things later. That'll be best for us

both."
Peter junior was silenced, though he thought he knew his father too

well to draw great encouragement from an offer of future discussion.

The old man assuredly did feel ill, and it would have been brutal to

force him into further argument. The only thing was to go now and

attack him again before the sensitive surface of his feelings had had

time thoroughly to harden.
Young Peter and his mother lunched alone together at the stately

English hour of two which Ena had decreed for the household. Old Peter

had ordered a cup of hot milk and had sent word that, his indigestion

being rather worse than usual, he intended to spend the afternoon

lying down. This had often happened before, and mother, though

distressed, was not alarmed.
She would not have admitted it in words to herself, but she was happy

in her tête-à-tête with Petro. He had his place moved near hers.

They dared to dismiss the dignified servants and help themselves to

what they wanted. Or, rather, Petro jumped up and helped her, whether

she wanted things or not. They talked about Miss Child, and Petro

related his adventure at the Hands, which he had not, until the

luncheon hour, been able to describe in detail.
He told his mother again, several times over, how wonderful Win was,

and mother was not bored. She listened with a rapt smile, especially

to the part about the fire in the hospital room and the girl's quick

presence of mind, Win having refused to confess how she had hurt her

hands, Petro had used the influence of his name to find out tactfully

from another source, all that had happened. And he made quite a good

story out of it for his mother. The latter promised gladly to go and

see Miss Child and to wear the pearl-gray wrap, which she thought very

pretty, reflecting marvellous credit on the taste of the chooser.
Petro did not touch upon Miss Child's indictment of the Hands. It

seemed unnecessary to distress mother just when she was interested and

even delighted (not at all shocked or startled) at having father's

secret broken to her.
"It's more natural," she said, "that he should take an interest in the

Hands. More like he used to be. I often wondered––"
Another sentence which she did not need to finish!
For a while Petro's whole soul was so steeped in the joy of mother's

sympathy, and in plans for the future, that he forgot the faint

uneasiness which had stirred within him at father's message about the

milk. Something had seemed to whisper: "It's only an excuse." And his

asking not to be disturbed all the afternoon, "can it mean that he's

got a special reason for wanting to be let alone hour after hour?"
But Petro and mother had been deep in conversation before the whisper

came. In the very midst of it she had asked a beautifully

understanding question about Win, and in answering Petro forgot

everything else for a time.
They talked intimately in the big, unfriendly, imitation Elizabethan

dining-room which for once they had to themselves And then they

continued their talk still more intimately in the "den." It was only

the grandfather clock striking four that reminded Petro of his

uneasiness and of the whisper.
Why it did remind him he could hardly have explained, except that the

clock had a very curious individuality for him. It had belonged to his

great grandmother and had come down through her to his mother. Even as

a little boy he had felt that it was more than a clock: it was an

old friend who had ticked through the years, keeping time with the

heart-beats of those for whom it told the passing moments of life and

death. Often he had imagined that with its ticking it gave good

advice, if only one could understand. Now, when it struck four, it

seemed to Petro that it did so in a dry, peremptory manner intended to

be arresting, to remind him of something important that he was in

danger of forgetting.
This pause in his thoughts left room for the whisper to come again.

It came, adding to its first suggestion: "Don't you know that while

you and mother were lingering so happily over your lunch, father stole

away and went off to make mischief between you and the girl?"
Petro sprang up. He was ashamed to harbour such a thought of

treachery, but it was there. He could easily learn whether father had

gone to New York by inquiring if one of the motors had been taken out.

But it was hardly worth while to ask questions. Peter knew that his

father had gone, and why.
 
 
CHAPTER XXVII
THE BATTLE
All the morning Win was in a state of strange, almost hysterical,

exaltation. Again and again she warned her spirit down from the

heights, but it would not hear, and stood there in the sunshine

singing a wild song of love and joy.
Wonderful, incredible pictures painted themselves before her eyes. She

saw Peter, impressed with her words—as indeed he had seemed to

be—and remembering them nobly for the benefit of the two thousand

hands within the Hands. She saw herself as his wife (oh, bold,

forbidden thought, which dared her to push it from her heart!) helping

him reach the ideal standard of what a great department store should

be, planning new and highly improved systems of insurance, thinking

out ways for employees to share profits, and of giving them pensions.
She, who knew what the hands suffered and what they needed, could do

for them what no outsider could ever do. With Peter's money and power

and the will to aid, there would be nothing they two could not

accomplish. Their love would teach them how to love the world. She saw

the grand Christmas parties and the summer picnics the Hands would

give the hands, and Peter's idea for a convalescent home should be

splendidly carried out. She saw the very furniture and its chintz

covers—then the picture would vanish like a rainbow—or break into

disjointed bits, like the jig-saw puzzle Peter senior had hidden

shamefacedly in a drawer.
For some moments Winifred's mind would be a blank save for a jumble of

Paris mantles and warm customers, then another picture would form: she

would see Peter and herself sending Sadie Kirk to the mountains, where

the girl would be even happier and healthier than at the new place

which was "free for consumers." Sadie would be Win's own special

charge, her Mend, for whom she had the right and privilege to provide.

No more work in shops for Sadie! No more work at all till she was

cured. Perhaps a winter in the Adirondacks, then such radiant health

as the "sardine" had hardly ever known.
Meanwhile the thoughts of Ursus must be turned from the girl who could

never love him to the girl who already did. He and Sadie had been good

chums since the day when all three marched in procession toward Mr.

Meggison's window—how long ago it seemed! The big heart of the lion

tamer was easily moved to pity, and pity was akin to love. When

she—Win—gently broke it to him that she was going to marry Peter

Rolls, whom she had loved before she ever saw her poor Ursus (of

course she had loved Peter always! that was why it had hurt her so

cruelly to believe Ena) the dear big fellow, pitying Sadie's weakness,

would turn to his "little old chum" for comfort.
Oh, yes, everything would come right! warbled the disobedient spirit

singing on the heights. Then the common sense and pride in Win would

pluck the spirit's robe, and presto! another picture would dissolve

into gray cloud.
Going out to luncheon (ice-cream soda and a sponge cake) somehow

broke the radiant charm. Common sense put the singing spirit

relentlessly into its proper place, where, discouraged, it sang no

more. Ugly memories of last night's danger and humiliation crowded

back into the brain no longer irradiated by Peter's presence. Win felt

dully that none of the glorious fancies of the morning could ever come

true, though she still hoped that her words might have some living

influence upon the future of the Hands.
Even if Peter really and truly wanted to marry her (which seemed

incredible), and his sister misjudged him (also well-nigh incredible),

Ena Rolls and Ena Rolls's father would bar the way to any such

happiness as the magic pictures had shown. It would be hateful to

force herself upon a snobbish family who despised her and let her see

that she was unwelcome.
The girl was suddenly surprised because she hadn't seen, the moment

Peter's back was turned (even if not before), that the one

self-respecting thing was to give up her place at the Hands. It would

be decent and rather noble to disappear as she had disappeared before,

so that Peter, when he came again (as he surely would), should find

her gone.
This thought made so gloomy a picture in contrast with the forbidden

bright ones, that Win was nearer tears than she had been in the

hospital room.
"Laugh—laugh—if you laugh like a hyena!" she was saying to herself

between half-past four and five, when other girls were thinking of the

nice things they would do when they got home.
Win envied them. She wished the things that satisfied them could

satisfy her. Yet, no, she did not wish that. Divine dissatisfaction

was better. She must keep that conviction before her through years

which might otherwise be gray. For now she was quite sure that nothing

beautiful, nothing glorious, nothing even exciting, could ever happen

to her. And it was at this very moment that she received a peremptory

summons to Mr. Croft's office.
"It'll be about the fire, maybe," the nicest girl in the department

encouraged her. "I shouldn't wonder if they're going to give you a

reward. If there was anything wrong, the word would come through

Meggison sure."
Win smiled thanks as she went to her fate; the girl was kind, not of

the tigress breed. But she couldn't guess how little any paltry act of

injustice from the Hands would matter now.
Miss Child had never before been called to the office of the great Mr.

Croft, but she knew where it was, and walked to the door persuading

herself that she was not in the least afraid. Why should she be afraid

when she intended—really quite intended—to leave the Hands of her

own accord?
There was an outer office guarding the inner shrine, and here a girl

typist and a waxy-faced young man were getting ready to go home. It

was now very near the closing hour. The waxy-faced youth, a secretary

of Mr. Croft's, minced to the shrine door, opened it, spoke, returned,

and announced that Miss Child was to go in. He even held the door for

her, which might be a sign of respect, or of compassion for one about

to be executed. Then, as the girl stepped in, the door closed behind

her, and she stood in an expensively hideous room, looking at a

little, dried-up dark man who sat in Mr. Croft's chair at Mr. Croft's

desk. But he was not Mr. Croft. He was Peter Rolls, Sr.
Win recognized him instantly and knew not what to think. Luckily he

did not keep her long in suspense.
"You Miss Child?" he shortly inquired, holding her with a steady

stare, which from a younger man would have been offensive.
"I am, sir," she said in the low, sweet voice that Peter junior loved.

Even Peter senior was impressed with it in spite of himself, impressed

with the whole personality of the young woman whom Petro had said was

"made to be a princess." She looked a more difficult proposition than

he had expected to tackle.
"Know who I am?" he continued his catechism.
"You are Mr. Rolls."
"What makes you so sure of that, eh?"
"You were pointed out to me one evening last winter, when you were

inspecting the shop with Mr. Croft."
"Nobody had any business pointing me out. Who did?"
"I'm afraid I've forgotten," said the girl, more calmly than she felt.

"It was so long ago."
"You seem to have been dead certain he was right."
"I took it for granted."
"That's dangerous, taking things for granted. I advise you not to do

it, Miss Child."
Still he stared as she received his advice in silence. Not a feature

of the piquant, yet proud, arresting face, not a curve of the slim

figure, did his old eyes miss.
"I guess you haven't forgotten who pointed me out," he persisted,

after a pause. "Now think again. Have you? It might pay to

remember."
"I do not remember, sir." She threw up her head in the characteristic

way which the other Peter knew.
"Sure nothing could make you remember?"
"I'm sure nothing could."
"Very well, then, we must let that go for the present. Now to another

subject. I hear you showed a good deal of pluck this morning in

putting out a fire."
"Oh, after all, it may be only that!" Win thought.
She ought to have been relieved. But she was not certain whether

relief was her most prominent emotion. The girl did not quite know

what to make of herself, and the man was not giving her much time for

reflection.
"The little I did was done on the spur of the moment," she said. "I

don't deserve any credit."
"Well, I may be inclined to think different when it comes to settling

up. That depends on several things. We'll come to 'em by and by.

You're English, ain't you?"
"Yes."
"H-m! You look as if you ought to have titles running in your family.

Have you got any?"
Win fancied that this must be her employer's idea of a joke, but his

face was grave, and even curiously eager. "Not one," she answered,

smiling.
"No connections with titles?"
"Why, yes, we have some cousins afflicted in that way," she lightly

admitted, beginning to be faintly amused as well as puzzled. "Almost

every one has, in our country, I suppose."
"What sort of title is it?"
"Oh, my father's second cousin happens to be an earl."
"An earl, is he? That stands pretty high, I guess, on your side. Any

chance of your father inheriting?"
This time Win allowed herself the luxury of a laugh. What a strange

old man! And this was Mr. Balm of Gilead's father!
She was still in the dark as to why he had sent for her. But it must

be on account of the fire. His curiosity was very funny. In any one

except Peter's father she would have considered it ridiculous. Maybe

he wanted to work up a good "story" in the newspapers. Very likely it

could be turned into an "ad" for the Hands if the cousin of an English

earl had saved a fellow employee from burning up, and it would be

still more thrilling if the heroine might some day turn into a haughty

Lady Winifred Something. She shook her head, looking charming. Even

old Peter, staring so intently, must have admitted that.
"There's not the remotest chance," she replied. "Our cousin, Lord

Glenellen, has six sons. Four are married and having more sons every

year. I don't know how many there are. And I'm sure that they've

forgotten our existence."
"Well, there ain't much show for you in that connection!"
Mr. Rolls reluctantly abandoned the earldom. "What's your father,

anyhow?"
"A clergyman," said Win. "A poor clergyman, or I should never have

seen America."
"I suppose you'd have married some fellow over there. What did you do

for a living on your side?"
"I hadn't begun to do anything till I engaged with Nadine—the

dressmaker, you know—to be one of her models on board the Monarchic

so as to get my passage free. I thought I should be sure to make a

fortune in New York."
"Yes, I guess that was your point of view. You're frank about it,

ain't you?"
"One may be about a lost illusion."
"There's more than one way for a girl to make a fortune. Maybe you and

I can do business. So you were one of those models when you first met

my son?"
Win would not have been flesh and blood if that shot had not told,

especially after the old man's funny catechizing had lured her

amusingly away from suspicion. She quivered, and a bright colour

stained her cheeks. Nevertheless those peering eyes found no guilt in

her look.
"Yes," she answered bravely. "He bought a dress from us for his

sister."
"One excuse is as good as another for a young fellow. What else did he

do?"
"Gave us patent medicine. We were all dreadfully seasick."
"You don't mean to tell me he fell in love with you when you were

seasick?"
"I don't mean to tell you that he fell in love with me at all, Mr.

Rolls."
"I guess you didn't mean to. But, you see, I made you own up."
"There was nothing to tell."
"Well, the murder's out, anyhow. And that brings us back to a point I

want to make. Now that affair of this morning. You say you're

entitled to no credit. But I've been thinking I'd like to make it up

to you by giving a reward."
"I couldn't think of taking it!" cried Win.
Strange that he should break off suddenly from the subject of his son

(which, apparently, he had intended pursuing to some end), and jump

back to that of the fire! He must have a motive—he looked a man to

have motives for everything. She felt that he was laying a trap for

her, if she could only find it.
"Wait a minute. Give me time to make myself clear," he went on. "I'm

not talking about medals or lockets or silver cups for good girls. I

mean a thumping sum, a big enough stone to kill two birds. Folks not

in the know would think that it was for saving life. Those in the

know (meaning me and you, and nobody else) would understand that it

was for saving my son. No disrespect to you. I want to put it

delicately, miss. Saving him from a mistake."
Win had always thought "How dare you?" a very silly expression, no

matter what the provocation. Yet now she was tempted to use it. Only

her subconscious sense of humour, which warned her it would be

ridiculous from Peter Rolls's "saleslady" to Peter Rolls himself, made

her bite back the words that rushed to the end of her tongue.
"You have a strange idea of putting things delicately!" she cried.

"You offer me a reward if I—if I—oh, I can't say it!"
"I can," volunteered the old man coolly. "And I'll tell you just how

much I offer. Maybe that'll help your talking apparatus. I'll give you

ten thousand dollars. Wouldn't that be something like making your

fortune in New York?"
"If it were ten millions it would make no difference," the girl flung

at him. "I––"
"Say, you set a high value on my son Peter. But if he marries you, my

girl, he won't be worth any millions, or even thousands, I tell you

straight. He won't be worth a red cent. You'd better pick up my offer

while it's going, and drop Peter. Maybe with ten thousand dollars of

your own, one of your young cousins, the earls, might find you worth

while."
Never had Win even dreamed that it was possible for a human soul so to

boil with anger as hers had now begun to boil. She wanted to scald

this hateful old man with burning spray from the geyser. At last she

understood the rage which could kill. Yet it was in a low, restrained

voice that she heard herself speaking.
"Please don't go on," she warned him. "I suppose you don't quite

realize how hideously you're insulting me. A man who could say such

things wouldn't. And only such a man could misunderstand—could

think that instead of refusing his money I was bidding for more. I

wanted to say that you could save your son and your pocket, too.

Neither are in danger from me."
"That ain't the way the boy feels about it," Peter senior slipped the

words in slyly. "If he did, I wouldn't have sent for you."
This was the last drop in the cup.
"What?" cried the girl, towering over the shrunken figure in the

revolving chair. "Your son asked you to send for me? Then he's as

bad, as cruel, as you are."
A red wave of rage swept over her. She no longer knew what she was

saying. Her one wish—her one object in life, it seemed just then—was

to hurt both Peters.
"I hate him!" she exclaimed. "Everything I've heard about him is true,

after all. He's a false friend and a false lover—a dangerous, cruel

man to women, just as I was warned he was."
"Stop right there," broke in Peter's father. "That's damn nonsense,

and you know it. Nobody ever warned you that my boy was anything of

the kind."
"I was warned," she beat him down, "that it was a habit of your son to

win a girl's confidence with his kind ways and then deceive her."
"Then it was a damned lie, and no one but a damned fool would believe

it," shouted Peter Rolls, Sr. "My boy a deceiver of women? Why, he's a

Gala-what-you-may-call-it! He'd die any death sooner than harm a

woman. I'm his father, and I know what I'm talking about. Who the

devil warned you? Some beast, or some idiot?"
"It was neither."
"Who was it, then? Come, out with it. I dare you to. I'll have him

sued for slander. I'll––"
"It wasn't a he. It was a woman who ought to know at least as much

about him as you do."
"There's no such woman, except his mother, and she worships the ground

he walks on. Thinks he's a kind of up-to-date Saint George, and I'm

hanged if she's far wrong. Why, since Peter was a boy he's never cared

that"—and a yellow thumb and finger snapped for emphasis under Win's

eyes—"for any woman till he got silly over you."
The girl laughed a fierce little laugh. "You tell me this? You defend

him to me? Is that policy?"
Peter senior suddenly looked foolish. He had straightened himself to

glare at the upstart. Now he collapsed again.
"No, it ain't policy," he confessed, "but I guess it's human nature.

My blood ain't quite dried up yet, and I can't sit quiet while anybody

blackguards my own flesh and bone. You tell me who said these things

about him!"
"I will not tell you."
"Don't you know I'm liable to have you discharged for impudence?"
"You can't discharge me, for I've already discharged myself. I'd

rather starve than serve one more day at your horrid old Hands."
"Horrid old Hands, eh? I can keep you from getting a job in any other

store."
"I don't want one. I've had enough of stores. I am not afraid of

anything you can do, Mr. Rolls. Though they do call you 'Saint Peter'

behind your back—meaning just the opposite—you haven't the keys of

heaven."
"You're an impudent young hussy."
"Perhaps. But you deserve impudence. You deserve worse, sir. A moment

ago I hated you. I—think I could have killed you. But—but now I

can't help admiring something big in you, that makes you defend your

son in spite of yourself, when it was policy to let me loathe him."
"'Loathe' is no word to use for my boy," the old man caught her up

again. "I don't want you to marry him, no! But, whatever happens, I

can't have you or any one else doing him black injustice."
"Then, 'whatever happens,' I'll admit to you that never in the bottom

of my heart did I believe those things. I didn't believe them to-day,

but I—you were so horrible—I had to be horrible, too. There! The

same motive that made you defend him against your own interest has

made me confess that to you now. But you needn't be afraid. I don't

think in any case I could have married him knowing how his—his family

would feel. Still I might, if he'd tried to persuade me; I can't be

sure. I might have been weak. As it is, though—after you've insulted

me in this cruel way, I believe nothing would induce me to say yes if

he asked me. And he never has asked me."
"Never has asked you?" echoed Peter senior, dumbfounded.
Some one had begun to knock at the door, but he did not hear. Neither

did Winifred. Each was absorbed in the other. Insensibly their tones

in addressing each other were changed. Some other ingredient had

mysteriously mingled with their rage; or, poured upon its stormy

surface, had calmed the waves. They were enemies still, but the girl

had found the man human; the man, because he was man, found himself

yielding to her woman's domination.
Petro said God had made her a princess. She was only a shop girl, and

the vain old man wanted her out of his way—intended to put her out of

his way, by hook or by crook; but all the same in look and manner she

was his ideal of a girl queen, and he could understand Petro being a

fool over her.
"He never has asked you? But I thought––"
(Tap, tap, for the second and third time.)
"I know what you thought. You wouldn't listen when I tried to

explain."
(Tap, tap, tap! No answer. And so the door opened.)
"It isn't only that your son hasn't asked me to marry him, he hasn't

even told me he cared."
"But he does both now," said Peter Rolls, Jr., on the threshold.
As he spoke he came into the room with a few long, quick steps that

took him straight to Win, as if he wanted to protect her against his

father if need be. And timidly, yet firmly, he was followed by Mrs.

Rolls, wearing the new gray wrap.
"I'd have told you long ago if I'd had the chance," he went on. "I

told father this morning that I'd loved you ever since the first

minute I saw you, and that you were the only girl who ever was or ever

would be. I don't know what he's been saying to you, but I felt he

meant to—to—see what you were like. So I came. And nothing matters

if you can care a little and have faith enough in me to––"
"That's just what she doesn't do and hasn't got!" interpolated Peter

senior. "The girl's been calling you every name she could turn her

tongue to. Said she was warned against you by some woman—she wouldn't

tell me who it was––"
"I know who it was," put in his son.
"You do? We'll send her a writ, then––"
"We can't. She isn't in the country just now."
"I did say the most hateful things," Win admitted, "because your

father made me so angry. And—he defended you against me! He said

nobody but a fool could ever for a minute have believed such things

were true. And he was perfectly right. Can you forgive me?"
"Why, I love you, you know," said Peter. "And whether you ever

believed anything wrong of me or not, I—I almost think you love me a

little now to make up. You couldn't look at me like that if you

didn't, could you? It wouldn't be fair."
"I mustn't look at you at all, then," Win answered, pushing him gently

away as he tried to take her hands. "Please let me go. I can't––"
"I wouldn't let you go, if he did, my dear," said a gentle voice

that had not spoken yet. "I guess a girl that saves people from

themselves when they're on fire, burning up, and don't know in the

least what they're doing, would be just the kind of new daughter we

would like to have now when we have to let our own leave us. Why, you

would be worth your weight in gold at our house. Isn't that so,

Father?"
For once mother had finished four consecutive sentences in her

husband's presence. But this was an unusual occasion It seemed to her

that its like could never come again, and that here was her chance of

a lifetime to stand by Petro.
"H-m!" grunted Peter senior. "The girl ain't a coward, anyhow. She

stood up to me like a wildcat. Said she hated me. Said she wouldn't

take Peter if I paid her to—or words to that effect. Well, I didn't

exactly offer to pay her for doing that, rather the other way around.

But when she had the gorgeous cheek to up and say, after all, that she

liked me for defending you, why, I—well, I don't know how it was,

but all of a sudden I weakened to her. She got me same way as she

got you, Peter, I suppose. Maybe it was with one of her laughs!

Anyhow—look here, miss. If you'll take back your words, I'll take

back mine. Cut 'em right out."
"Which words?" Win cautiously wanted to know.
"The whole lot, while we're about it. I guess a sister-in-law who's

got earls for cousins ought to be good enough for a marchesa. You've

got me, I tell you! And you can have Peter, too, if you want him. Do

you?"
"I do," answered Win—and laughed again, the happiest, most surprised,

and excited laugh in the world.
"Then we've got each other—forever!" cried Petro. "And, Father, you

and I will have each other, too, after this, as we never had before.

You shall bless this day as I do, and as mother will."
"All right," said old Peter. "We'll see about that. Anyhow, shake

hands."
Petro shook.
"And you, too, girl."
Winifred hesitated slightly, then held out her burned fingers.
Peter senior gave them deliberately to his son.
"There you are!" he exclaimed. "Now we're all three in the business."
"And this is the way we're going to run it in future," said Petro.

"With love."
