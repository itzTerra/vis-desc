THE KILLER
[Pg 3]ToC

CHAPTER I
I want to state right at the start that I am writing this story twenty

years after it happened solely because my wife and Señor Buck Johnson

insist on it. Myself, I don't think it a good yarn. It hasn't any love

story in it; and there isn't any plot. Things just happened, one thing

after the other. There ought to be a yarn in it somehow, and I suppose

if a fellow wanted to lie a little he could make a tail-twister out of

it. Anyway, here goes; and if you don't like it, you know you can quit

at any stage of the game.
It happened when I was a kid and didn't know any better than to do such

things. They dared me to go up to Hooper's ranch and stay all night; and

as I had no information on either the ranch or its owner, I saddled up

and went. It was only twelve miles from our Box Springs ranch—a nice

easy ride. I should explain that heretofore I had ridden the Gila end of

our range, which is so far away that only vague rumours of Hooper had

ever reached me at all. He was reputed a tough old devil with horrid

habits; but that meant little to me. The tougher and horrider they came,

the better they suited me—so I thought. Just to make everything

entirely clear I will add that this was in the year of 1897 and the Soda

Springs valley in Arizona.
[Pg 4]

By these two facts you old timers will gather the setting of my tale.

Indian days over; "nester" days with frame houses and vegetable patches

not yet here. Still a few guns packed for business purposes; Mexican

border handy; no railroad in to Tombstone yet; cattle rustlers lingering

in the Galiuros; train hold-ups and homicide yet prevalent but frowned

upon; favourite tipple whiskey toddy with sugar; but the old fortified

ranches all gone; longhorns crowded out by shorthorn blaze-head

Herefords or near-Herefords; some indignation against Alfred Henry

Lewis's Wolfville as a base libel; and, also but, no gasoline wagons

or pumps, no white collars, no tourists pervading the desert, and the

Injins still wearing blankets and overalls at their reservations instead

of bead work on the railway platforms when the Overland goes through. In

other words, we were wild and wooly, but sincerely didn't know it.
While I was saddling up to go take my dare, old Jed Parker came and

leaned himself up against the snubbing post of the corral. He watched me

for a while, and I kept quiet, knowing well enough that he had something

to say.
"Know Hooper?" he asked.
"I've seen him driving by," said I.
I had: a little humped, insignificant figure with close-cropped white

hair beneath a huge hat. He drove all hunched up. His buckboard was a

rattletrap, old, insulting challenge to every little stone in the road;

but there was nothing the matter with the horses or their harness. We

never held much with grooming in Arizona, but these beasts shone like

bronze. Good sizeable horses, clean built—well, I better not get

started talking horse! They're the reason I had [Pg 5]never really sized up

the old man the few times I'd passed him.
"Well, he's a tough bird," said Jed.
"Looks like a harmless old cuss—but mean," says I.
"About this trip," said Jed, after I'd saddled and coiled my

rope—"don't, and say you did."
I didn't answer this, but led my horse to the gate.
"Well, don't say as how I didn't tell you all about it," said Jed, going

back to the bunk house.
Miserable old coot! I suppose he thought he had told me all about it!

Jed was always too loquacious!
But I hadn't racked along more than two miles before a man cantered up

who was perfectly able to express himself. He was one of our outfit and

was known as Windy Bill. Nuff said!
"Hear you're goin' up to stay the night at Hooper's," said he. "Know

Hooper?"
"No, I don't," said I, "are you another of these Sunbirds with glad

news?"
"Know about Hooper's boomerang?"
"Boomerang!" I replied, "what's that?"
"That's what they call it. You know how of course we all let each

other's strays water at our troughs in this country, and send 'em back

to their own range at round up."
"Brother, you interest me," said I, "and would you mind informing me

further how you tell the dear little cows apart?"
"Well, old Hooper don't, that's all," went on Windy, without paying me

any attention. "He built him a chute leading to the water corrals, and

half way down the chute he [Pg 6]built a gate that would swing across it and

open a hole into a dry corral. And he had a high platform with a handle

that ran the gate. When any cattle but those of his own brands came

along, he had a man swing the gate and they landed up into the dry

corral. By and by he let them out on the range again."
"Without water?"
"Sure! And of course back they came into the chute. And so on. Till they

died, or we came along and drove them back home."
"Windy," said I, "you're stuffing me full of tacks."
"I've seen little calves lyin' in heaps against the fence like drifts of

tumbleweed," said Windy, soberly; and then added, without apparent

passion, "The old——!"
Looking at Windy's face, I knew these words for truth.
"He's a bad hombre," resumed Windy Bill after a moment. "He never does

no actual killing himself, but he's got a bad lot of oilers[A] there,

especially an old one named Andreas and another one called Ramon, and

all he has to do is to lift one eye at a man he don't like and that man

is as good as dead—one time or another."
This was going it pretty strong, and I grinned at Windy Bill.
"All right," said Windy, "I'm just telling you."
"Well, what's the matter with you fellows down here?" I challenged. "How

is it he's lasted so long? Why hasn't someone shot him? Are you all

afraid of him or his Mexicans?"
"No, it ain't that, exactly. I don't know. He drives by [Pg 7]all alone, and

he don't pack no gun ever, and he's sort of runty—and—I do'no why he

ain't been shot, but he ain't. And if I was you, I'd stick home."
Windy amused but did not greatly persuade me. By this time I was fairly

conversant with the cowboy's sense of humour. Nothing would have tickled

them more than to bluff me out of a harmless excursion by means of

scareful tales. Shortly Windy Bill turned off to examine a distant bunch

of cattle; and so I rode on alone.
It was coming on toward evening. Against the eastern mountains were

floating tinted mists; and the cañons were a deep purple. The cattle

were moving slowly so that here and there a nimbus of dust caught and

reflected the late sunlight into gamboge yellows and mauves. The magic

time was near when the fierce, implacable day-genius of the desert would

fall asleep and the soft, gentle, beautiful star-eyed night-genius of

the desert would arise and move softly. My pony racked along in the

desert. The mass that represented Hooper's ranch drew imperceptibly

nearer. I made out the green of trees and the white of walls and

building.

[Pg 8]
CHAPTER II
Hooper's ranch proved to be entirely enclosed by a wall of adobe ten

feet high and whitewashed. To the outside it presented a blank face.

Only corrals and an alfalfa patch were not included. A wide, high

gateway, that could be closed by massive doors, let into a stable yard,

and seemed to be the only entrance. The buildings within were all

immaculate also: evidently Old Man Hooper loved whitewash. Cottonwood

trees showed their green heads; and to the right I saw the sloped

shingled roof of a larger building. Not a living creature was in sight.

I shook myself, saying that the undoubted sinister feeling of utter

silence and lifelessness was compounded of my expectations and the time

of day. But that did not satisfy me. My aroused mind, casting about,

soon struck it: I was missing the swarms of blackbirds, linnets, purple

finches, and doves that made our own ranch trees vocal. Here were no

birds. Laughing at this simple explanation of my eerie feeling, I passed

under the gate and entered the courtyard.
It, too, seemed empty. A stable occupied all one side; the other three

were formed by bunk houses and necessary out-buildings. Here, too, dwelt

absolute solitude and absolute silence. It was uncanny, as though one

walked in a vacuum. Everything was neat and shut up and whitewashed and

apparently dead. There were no sounds or signs of occupancy. [Pg 9]I was as

much alone as though I had been in the middle of an ocean. My mind, by

now abnormally sensitive and alert, leaped on this idea. For the same

reason, it insisted—lack of life: there were no birds here, not even

flies! Of course, said I, gone to bed in the cool of evening: why

should there be? I laughed aloud and hushed suddenly; and then nearly

jumped out of my skin. The thin blue curl of smoke had caught my eye;

and I became aware of the figure of a man seated on the ground, in the

shadow, leaning against the building. The curl of smoke was from his

cigarette. He was wrapped in a serape which blended well with the cool

colour of shadow. My eyes were dazzled with the whitewash—natural

enough—yet the impression of solitude had been so complete. It was

uncanny, as though he had materialized out of the shadow itself. Silly

idea! I ranged my eye along the row of houses, and I saw three other

figures I had missed before, all broodingly immobile, all merged in

shadow, all watching me, all with the insubstantial air of having as I

looked taken body from thin air.
This was too foolish! I dismounted, dropped my horse's reins over his

head, and sauntered to the nearest figure. He was lost in the dusk of

the building and of his Mexican hat. I saw only the gleam of eyes.
"Where will I find Mr. Hooper?" I asked.
The figure waved a long, slim hand toward a wicket gate in one side of

the enclosure. He said no word, nor made another motion; and the other

figures sat as though graved from stone.
After a moment's hesitation I pushed open the wicket [Pg 10]gate, and so found

myself in a smaller intimate courtyard of most surprising character. Its

centre was green grass, and about its border grew tall, bright flowers.

A wide verandah ran about three sides. I could see that in the numerous

windows hung white lace curtains. Mind you, this was in Arizona of the

'nineties!
I knocked at the nearest door, and after an interval it opened and I

stood face to face with Old Man Hooper himself.
He proved to be as small as I had thought, not taller than my own

shoulder, with a bent little figure dressed in wrinkled and baggy store

clothes of a snuff brown. His bullet head had been cropped so that his

hair stood up like a short-bristled white brush. His rather round face

was brown and lined. His hands, which grasped the doorposts

uncompromisingly to bar the way, were lean and veined and old. But all

that I found in my recollections afterward to be utterly unimportant.

His eyes were his predominant, his formidable, his compelling

characteristic. They were round, the pupils very small, the irises large

and of a light flecked blue. From the pupils radiated fine lines. The

blank, cold, inscrutable stare of them bored me through to the back of

the neck. I suppose the man winked occasionally, but I never got that

impression. I've noticed that owls have this same intent, unwinking

stare—and wildcats.
"Mr. Hooper," said I, "can you keep me over night?"
It was a usual request in the old cattle country. He continued to stare

at me for some moments.
"Where are you from?" he asked at length. His voice was soft and low;

rather purring.
[Pg 11]I mentioned our headquarters on the Gila: it did not seem worth while

to say anything about Box Springs only a dozen miles away. He stared at

me for some time more.
"Come in," he said, abruptly; and stood aside.
This was a disconcerting surprise. All I had expected was permission to

stop, and a direction as to how to find the bunk house. Then a more or

less dull evening, and a return the following day to collect on my

"dare." I stepped into the dimness of the hallway; and immediately after

into a room beyond.
Again I must remind you that this was the Arizona of the 'nineties. All

the ranch houses with which I was acquainted, and I knew about all of

them, were very crudely done. They comprised generally a half dozen

rooms with adobe walls and rough board floors, with only such

furnishings as deal tables, benches, homemade chairs, perhaps a battered

old washstand or so, and bunks filled with straw. We had no such things

as tablecloths and sheets, of course. Everything was on a like scale of

simple utility.
All right, get that in your mind. The interior into which I now stepped,

with my clanking spurs, my rattling chaps, the dust of my

sweat-stained garments, was a low-ceilinged, dim abode with faint, musty

aromas. Carpets covered the floors; an old-fashioned hat rack flanked

the door on one side, a tall clock on the other. I saw in passing framed

steel engravings. The room beyond contained easy chairs, a sofa

upholstered with hair cloth, an upright piano, a marble fireplace with a

mantel, in a corner a triangular what-not filled with objects. It, too,

was dim and curtained and faintly aromatic as had been the house of an

old maiden [Pg 12]aunt of my childhood, who used to give me cookies on the

Sabbath. I felt now too large, and too noisy, and altogether mis-dressed

and blundering and dirty. The little old man moved without a sound, and

the grandfather's clock outside ticked deliberately in a hollow silence.
I sat down, rather gingerly, in the chair he indicated for me.
"I shall be very glad to offer you hospitality for the night," he said,

as though there had been no interim. "I feel honoured at the

opportunity."
I murmured my thanks, and a suggestion that I should look after my

horse.
"Your horse, sir, has been attended to, and your cantinas[B] are

undoubtedly by now in your room, where, I am sure, you are anxious to

repair."
He gave no signal, nor uttered any command, but at his last words a

grave, elderly Mexican appeared noiselessly at my elbow. As a matter of

fact, he came through an unnoticed door at the back, but he might as

well have materialized from the thin air for the start that he gave me.

Hooper instantly arose.
"I trust, sir, you will find all to your liking. If anything is lacking,

I trust you will at once indicate the fact. We shall dine in a half

hour——"
He seized a small implement consisting of a bit of wire screen attached

to the end of a short stick, darted across the room with the most

extraordinary agility, thwacked a lone house fly, and returned.
"—and you will undoubtedly be ready for it," he finished [Pg 13]his speech,

calmly, as though he had not moved from his tracks.
I murmured my acknowledgments. My last impression as I left the room was

of the baleful, dead, challenging stare of the man's wildcat eyes.
The Mexican glided before me. We emerged into the court, walked along

the verandah, and entered a bedroom. My guide slipped by me and

disappeared before I had the chance of a word with him. He may have been

dumb for all I know. I sat down and tried to take stock.

[Pg 14]
CHAPTER III
The room was small, but it was papered, it was rugged, its floor was

painted and waxed, its window—opening into the court, by the way—was

hung with chintz and net curtains, its bed was garnished with sheets and

counterpane, its chairs were upholstered and in perfect repair and

polish. It was not Arizona, emphatically not, but rather the sweet and

garnished and lavendered respectability of a Connecticut village. My

dirty old cantinas lay stacked against the washstand. At sight of them

I had to grin. Of course I travelled cowboy fashion. They contained a

toothbrush, a comb, and a change of underwear. The latter item was

sheer, rank pride of caste.
It was all most incongruous and strange. But the strangest part, of

course, was the fact that I found myself where I was at that moment. Why

was I thus received? Why was I, an ordinary and rather dirty cowpuncher,

not sent as usual to the men's bunk house? It could not be possible that

Old Man Hooper extended this sort of hospitality to every chance

wayfarer. Arizona is a democratic country, Lord knows: none more so! But

owners are not likely to invite in strange cowboys unless they

themselves mess with their own men. I gave it up, and tried

unsuccessfully to shrug it off my mind, and sought distraction in

looking about me. There was not much to see. The one door and one

[Pg 15]window opened into the court. The other side was blank except that near

the ceiling ran a curious, long, narrow opening closed by a transom-like

sash. I had never seen anything quite like it, but concluded that it

must be a sort of loop hole for musketry in the old days. Probably they

had some kind of scaffold to stand on.
I pulled off my shirt and took a good wash: shook the dust out of my

clothes as well as I could; removed my spurs and chaps; knotted my

silk handkerchief necktie fashion; slicked down my wet hair, and tried

to imagine myself decently turned out for company. I took off my gun

belt also; but after some hesitation thrust the revolver inside the

waistband of my drawers. Had no reason; simply the border instinct to

stick to one's weapon.
Then I sat down to wait. The friendly little noises of my own movements

left me. I give you my word, never before nor since have I experienced

such stillness. In vain I told myself that with adobe walls two feet

thick, a windless evening, and an hour after sunset, stillness was to be

expected. That did not satisfy. Silence is made up of a thousand little

noises so accustomed that they pass over the consciousness. Somehow

these little noises seemed to lack. I sat in an aural vacuum. This

analysis has come to me since. At that time I only knew that most

uneasily I missed something, and that my ears ached from vain listening.
At the end of the half hour I returned to the parlour. Old Man Hooper

was there waiting. A hanging lamp had been lighted. Out of the shadows

cast from it a slender figure rose and came forward.
"My daughter, Mr.——" he paused.
[Pg 16]"Sanborn," I supplied.
"My dear, Mr. Sanborn has most kindly dropped in to relieve the tedium

of our evening with his company—his distinguished company." He

pronounced the words suavely, without a trace of sarcastic emphasis, yet

somehow I felt my face flush. And all the time he was staring at me

blankly with his wide, unblinking, wildcat eyes.
The girl was very pale, with black hair and wide eyes under a fair, wide

brow. She was simply dressed in some sort of white stuff. I thought she

drooped a little. She did not look at me, nor speak to me; only bowed

slightly.
We went at once into a dining room at the end of the little dark hall.

It was lighted by a suspended lamp that threw the illumination straight

down on a table perfect in its appointments of napery, silver, and

glass. I felt very awkward and dusty in my cowboy rig; and rather too

large. The same Mexican served us, deftly. We had delightful food, well

cooked. I do not remember what it was. My attention was divided between

the old man and his daughter. He talked, urbanely, of a wide range of

topics, displaying a cosmopolitan taste, employing a choice of words and

phrases that was astonishing. The girl, who turned out to be very pretty

in a dark, pale, sad way, never raised her eyes from her plate.
It was the cool of the evening, and a light breeze from the open window

swung the curtains. From the blackness outside a single frog began to

chirp. My host's flow of words eddied, ceased. He raised his head

uneasily; then, without apology, slipped from his chair and glided from

the room. The Mexican remained, standing bolt upright in the dimness.
[Pg 17]For the first time the girl spoke. Her voice was low and sweet, but

either I or my aroused imagination detected a strained under quality.
"Ramon," she said in Spanish, "I am chilly. Close the window."
The servant turned his back to obey. With a movement rapid as a snake's

dart the girl's hand came from beneath the table, reached across, and

thrust into mine a small, folded paper. The next instant she was back in

her place, staring down as before in apparent apathy. So amazed was I

that I recovered barely soon enough to conceal the paper before Ramon

turned back from his errand.
The next five minutes were to me hours of strained and bewildered

waiting. I addressed one or two remarks to my companion, but received

always monosyllabic answers. Twice I caught the flash of lanterns beyond

the darkened window; and a subdued, confused murmur as though several

people were walking about stealthily. Except for this the night had

again fallen deathly still. Even the cheerful frog had hushed.
At the end of a period my host returned, and without apology or

explanation resumed his seat and took up his remarks where he had left

them.
The girl disappeared somewhere between the table and the sitting room.

Old Man Hooper offered me a cigar, and sat down deliberately to

entertain me. I had an uncomfortable feeling that he was also amusing

himself, as though I were being played with and covertly sneered at.

Hooper's politeness and suavity concealed, and well concealed, a bitter

irony. His manner was detached and a little precise. [Pg 18]Every few moments

he burst into a flurry of activity with the fly whacker, darting here

and there as his eyes fell upon one of the insects; but returning always

calmly to his discourse with an air of never having moved from his

chair. He talked to me of Praxiteles, among other things. What should an

Arizona cowboy know of Praxiteles? and why should any one talk to him of

that worthy Greek save as a subtle and hidden expression of contempt?

That was my feeling. My senses and mental apperceptions were by now a

little on the raw.
That, possibly, is why I noticed the very first chirp of another frog

outside. It continued, and I found myself watching my host covertly.

Sure enough, after a few repetitions I saw subtle signs of uneasiness,

of divided attention; and soon, again without apology or explanation, he

glided from the room. And at the same instant the old Mexican servitor

came and pretended to fuss with the lamps.
My curiosity was now thoroughly aroused, but I could guess no means of

satisfying it. Like the bedroom, this parlour gave out only on the

interior court. The flash of lanterns against the ceiling above reached

me. All I could do was to wander about looking at the objects in the

cabinet and the pictures on the walls. There was, I remember, a set of

carved ivory chessmen and an engraving of the legal trial of some

English worthy of the seventeenth century. But my hearing was alert, and

I thought to hear footsteps outside. At any rate, the chirp of the frog

came to an abrupt end.
Shortly my host returned and took up his monologue. [Pg 19]It amounted to

that. He seemed to delight in choosing unusual subjects and then backing

me into a corner with an array of well-considered phrases that allowed

me no opening for reply nor even comment. In one of my desperate

attempts to gain even a momentary initiative I asked him, apropos of the

piano, whether his daughter played.
"Do you like music?" he added, and without waiting for a reply seated

himself at the instrument.
He played to me for half an hour. I do not know much about music; but I

know he played well and that he played good things. Also that, for the

first time, he came out of himself, abandoned himself to feeling. His

close-cropped head swayed from side to side; his staring, wildcat eyes

half closed——
He slammed shut the piano and arose, more drily precise than ever.
"I imagine all that is rather beyond your apperceptions," he remarked,

"and that you are ready for your bed. Here is a short document I would

have you take to your room for perusal. Good-night."
He tendered me a small, folded paper which I thrust into the breast

pocket of my shirt along with the note handed me earlier in the evening

by the girl. Thus dismissed I was only too delighted to repair to my

bedroom.
There I first carefully drew together the curtains; then examined the

first of the papers I drew from my pocket. It proved to be the one from

the girl, and read as follows:
I am here against my will. I am not this man's daughter. For God's

     sake if you can help me, do so. But be careful for [Pg 20]he is a

     dangerous man. My room is the last one on the left wing of the

     court. I am constantly guarded. I do not know what you can do. The

     case is hopeless. I cannot write more. I am watched.
I unfolded the paper Hooper himself had given me. It was similar in

appearance to the other, and read:
I am held a prisoner. This man Hooper is not my father but he is

     vindictive and cruel and dangerous. Beware for yourself. I live in

     the last room in the left wing. I am watched, so cannot write more.
The handwriting of the two documents was the same. I stared at one paper

and then at the other, and for a half hour I thought all the thoughts

appropriate to the occasion. They led me nowhere, and would not interest

you.

[Pg 21]
CHAPTER IV
After a time I went to bed, but not to sleep. I placed my gun under my

pillow, locked and bolted the door, and arranged a string cunningly

across the open window so that an intruder—unless he had extraordinary

luck—could not have failed to kick up a devil of a clatter. I was

young, bold, without nerves; so that I think I can truthfully say I was

not in the least frightened. But I cannot deny I was nervous—or rather

the whole situation was on my nerves. I lay on my back staring straight

at the ceiling. I caught myself gripping the sheets and listening. Only

there was nothing to listen to. The night was absolutely still. There

were no frogs, no owls, no crickets even. The firm old adobe walls gave

off no creak nor snap of timbers. The world was muffled—I almost said

smothered. The psychological effect was that of blank darkness, the

black darkness of far underground, although the moon was sailing the

heavens.
How long that lasted I could not tell you. But at last the silence was

broken by the cheerful chirp of a frog. Never was sound more grateful to

the ear! I lay drinking it in as thirstily as water after a day on the

desert. It seemed that the world breathed again, was coming alive after

syncope. And then beneath that loud and cheerful singing I became aware

of duller half-heard movements; and a moment or so later yellow lights

began to flicker through the [Pg 22]transom high at the blank wall of the

room, and to reflect in wavering patches on the ceiling. Evidently

somebody was afoot outside with a lantern.
I crept from the bed, moved the table beneath the transom, and climbed

atop. The opening was still a foot or so above my head. Being young,

strong, and active, I drew myself up by the strength of my arms so I

could look—until my muscles gave out!
I saw four men with lanterns moving here and there among some willows

that bordered what seemed to be an irrigating ditch with water. They

were armed with long clubs. Old Man Hooper, in an overcoat, stood in a

commanding position. They seemed to be searching. Suddenly from a clump

of bushes one of the men uttered an exclamation of triumph. I saw his

long club rise and fall. At that instant my tired fingers slipped from

the ledge and I had to let myself drop to the table. When a moment later

I regained my vantage point, I found that the whole crew had

disappeared.
Nothing more happened that night. At times I dozed in a broken sort of

fashion, but never actually fell into sound sleep. The nearest I came to

slumber was just at dawn. I really lost all consciousness of my

surroundings and circumstances, and was only slowly brought to myself by

the sweet singing of innumerable birds in the willows outside the blank

wall. I lay in a half stupor enjoying them. Abruptly their music ceased.

I heard the soft, flat spat of a miniature rifle. The sound was

repeated. I climbed back on my table and drew myself again to a position

of observation.
[Pg 23]Old Man Hooper, armed with a .22 calibre rifle, was prowling along the

willows in which fluttered a small band of migratory birds. He was just

drawing bead on a robin. At the report the bird fell. The old man darted

forward with the impetuosity of a boy, although the bird was dead. An

impulse of contempt curled my lips. The old man was childish! Why should

he find pleasure in hunting such harmless creatures? and why should he

take on triumph over retrieving such petty game? But when he reached the

fallen bird he did not pick it up for a possible pot-pie as I thought he

would do. He ground it into the soft earth with the heel of his boot,

stamping on the poor thing again and again. And never have I seen on

human countenance such an expression of satisfied malignity!
I went to my door and looked out. You may be sure that the message I had

received from the unfortunate young lady had not been forgotten; but Old

Man Hooper's cynical delivery of the second paper had rendered me too

cautious to undertake anything without proper reconnaissance. The left

wing about the courtyard seemed to contain two apartments—at least

there were two doors, each with its accompanying window. The window

farthest out was heavily barred. My thrill at this discovery was,

however, slightly dashed by the further observation that also all the

other windows into the courtyard were barred. Still, that was peculiar

in itself, and not attributable—as were the walls and remarkable

transoms—to former necessities of defence. My first thought was to

stroll idly around the courtyard, thus obtaining a closer inspection.

But the moment I stepped into the open a Mexican sauntered into [Pg 24]view

and began to water the flowers. I can say no more than that in his hands

that watering pot looked fairly silly. So I turned to the right and

passed through the wicket gate and into the stable yard. It was natural

enough that I should go to look after my own horse.
The stable yard was for the moment empty; but as I walked across it one

of its doors opened and a very little, wizened old man emerged leading a

horse. He tied the animal to a ring in the wall and proceeded at once to

currying.
I had been in Arizona for ten years. During that time I had seen a great

many very fine native horses, for the stock of that country is directly

descended from the barbs of the conquistadores. But, though often well

formed and as tough and useful as horseflesh is made, they were small.

And no man thought of refinements in caring for any one of his numerous

mounts. They went shaggy or smooth according to the season; and not one

of them could have called a curry comb or brush out of its name.
The beast from which the wizened old man stripped a bona fide horse

blanket was none of these. He stood a good sixteen hands; his head was

small and clean cut with large, intelligent eyes and little, well-set

ears; his long, muscular shoulders sloped forward as shoulders should;

his barrel was long and deep and well ribbed up; his back was flat and

straight; his legs were clean and—what was rarely seen in the cow

country—well proportioned—the cannon bone shorter than the leg bone,

the ankle sloping and long and elastic—in short, a magnificent creature

whose points of excellence appeared one by one under close scrutiny.

[Pg 25]And the high lights of his glossy coat flashed in the sun like water.
I walked from one side to the other of him marvelling. Not a defect, not

even a blemish could I discover. The animal was fairly a perfect

specimen of horseflesh. And I could not help speculating as to its use.

Old Man Hooper had certainly never appeared with it in public; the fame

of such a beast would have spread the breadth of the country.
During my inspection the wizened little man continued his work without

even a glance in my direction. He had on riding breeches and leather

gaiters, a plaid waistcoat and a peaked cap; which, when you think of

it, was to Arizona about as incongruous as the horse. I made several

conventional remarks of admiration, to which he paid not the slightest

attention. But I know a bait.
"I suppose you claim him as a Morgan," said I.
"Claim, is it!" grunted the little man, contemptuously.
"Well, the Morgan is not a real breed, anyway," I persisted. "A

sixty-fourth blood will get one registered. What does that amount to?"
The little man grunted again.
"Besides, though your animal is a good one, he is too short and straight

in the pasterns," said I, uttering sheer, rank, wild heresy.
After that we talked; at first heatedly, then argumentatively, then with

entire, enthusiastic agreement. I saw to that. Allowing yourself to be

converted from an absurd opinion is always a sure way to favour. We

ended with antiphonies of praise for this descendant of Justin Morgan.
"You're the only man in all this God-forsaken country [Pg 26]that has the

sense of a Shanghai rooster!" cried the little man in a glow. "They ride

horses and they know naught of them; and they laugh at a horseman! Your

hand, sir!" He shook it. "And is that your horse in number four? I

wondered! He's the first animal I've seen here properly shod. They use

the rasp, sir, on the outside the hoof, and on the clinches, sir; and

they burn a seat for the shoe; and they pare out the sole and trim the

frog—bah! You shoe your own horse, I take it. That's right and proper!

Your hand again, sir. Your horse has been fed this hour agone."
"I'll water him, then," said I.
But when I led him forth I could find no trough or other facilities

until the little man led me to a corner of the corral and showed me a

contraption with a close-fitting lid to be lifted.
"It's along of the flies," he explained to me. "They must drink, and we

starve them for water here, and they go greedy for their poison yonder."

He indicated flat dishes full of liquid set on shelves here and about.

"We keep them pretty clear."
I walked over, curiously, to examine. About and in the dishes were

literally quarts of dead insects, not only flies, but bees, hornets, and

other sorts as well. I now understood the deadly silence that had so

impressed me the evening before. This was certainly most ingenious; and

I said so.
But at my first remark the old man became obstinately silent, and fell

again to grooming the Morgan horse. Then I became aware that he was

addressing me in low tones out of the corner of his mouth.
"Go on; look at the horse; say something," he muttered, [Pg 27]busily

polishing down the animal's hind legs. "You're a man who saveys a

horse—the only man I've seen here who does. Get out! Don't ask why.

You're safe now. You're not safe here another day. Water your horse; eat

your breakfast; then get out!"
And not another word did I extract. I watered my horse at the covered

trough, and rather thoughtfully returned to the courtyard.
I found there Old Man Hooper waiting. He looked as bland and innocent

and harmless as the sunlight on his own flagstones—until he gazed up at

me, and then I was as usual disconcerted by the blank, veiled, unwinking

stare of his eyes.
"Remarkably fine Morgan stallion you have, sir," I greeted him. "I

didn't know such a creature existed in this part of the world."
But the little man displayed no gratification.
"He's well enough. I have him more to keep Tim happy than anything else.

We'll go in to breakfast."
I cast a cautious eye at the barred window in the left wing. The

curtains were still down. At the table I ventured to ask after Miss

Hooper. The old man stared at me up to the point of embarrassment, then

replied drily that she always breakfasted in her room. The rest of our

conversation was on general topics. I am bound to say it was

unexpectedly easy. The old man was a good talker, and possessed social

ease and a certain charm, which he seemed to be trying to exert. Among

other things, I remember, he told me of the Indian councils he used to

hold in the old days.
"They were held on the willow flat, outside the east [Pg 28]wall," he said. "I

never allowed any of them inside the walls." The suavity of his manner

broke fiercely and suddenly. "Everything inside the walls is mine!" he

declared with heat. "Mine! mine! mine! Understand? I will not tolerate

in here anything that is not mine; that does not obey my will; that does

not come when I say come; go when I say go; and fall silent when I say

be still!"
A wild and fantastic idea suddenly illuminated my understanding.
"Even the crickets, the flies, the frogs, the birds," I said,

audaciously.
He fixed his wildcat eyes upon me without answering.
"And," I went on, deliberately, "who could deny your perfect right to do

what you will with your own? And if they did deny that right what more

natural than that they should be made to perish—or take their

breakfasts in their rooms?"
I was never more aware of the absolute stillness of the house than when

I uttered these foolish words. My hand was on the gun in my

trouser-band; but even as I spoke a sickening realization came over me

that if the old man opposite so willed, I would have no slightest chance

to use it. The air behind me seemed full of menace, and the hair crawled

on the back of my neck. Hooper stared at me without sign for ten

seconds; his right hand hovered above the polished table. Then he let it

fall without giving what I am convinced would have been a signal.
"Will you have more coffee—my guest?" he inquired. And he stressed

subtly the last word in a manner that somehow made me just a trifle

ashamed.
[Pg 29]At the close of the meal the Mexican familiar glided into the room.

Hooper seemed to understand the man's presence, for he arose at once.
"Your horse is saddled and ready," he told me, briskly. "You will be

wishing to start before the heat of the day. Your cantinas are ready

on the saddle."
He clapped on his hat and we walked together to the corral. There

awaited us not only my own horse, but another. The equipment of the

latter was magnificently reminiscent of the old California

days—gaily-coloured braided hair bridle and reins; silver conchas;

stock saddle of carved leather with silver horn and cantle; silvered bit

bars; gay Navajo blanket as corona; silver corners to skirts, silver

conchas on the long tapaderos. Old Man Hooper, strangely incongruous

in his wrinkled "store clothes," swung aboard.
"I will ride with you for a distance," he said.
We jogged forth side by side at the slow Spanish trot. Hooper called my

attention to the buildings of Fort Shafter glimmering part way up the

slopes of the distant mountains, and talked entertainingly of the Indian

days, and how the young officers used to ride down to his ranch for

music.
After a half hour thus we came to the long string of wire and the huge,

awkward gate that marked the limit of Hooper's "pasture." Of course the

open range was his real pasture; but every ranch enclosed a thousand

acres or so somewhere near the home station to be used for horses in

active service. Before I could anticipate him, he had sidled his horse

skillfully alongside the gate and was holding it open for me to pass. I

rode through the opening murmuring thanks and an apology. The old man

followed me [Pg 30]through, and halted me by placing his horse square across

the path of mine.
"You are now, sir, outside my land and therefore no longer my guest," he

said, and the snap in his voice was like the crackling of electricity.

"Don't let me ever see you here again. You are keen and intelligent. You

spoke the truth a short time since. You were right. I tolerate nothing

in my place that is not my own—no man, no animal, no bird, no insect

nor reptile even—that will not obey my lightest order. And these

creatures, great or small, who will not—or even cannot—obey my

orders must go—or die. Understand me clearly?
"You have come here, actuated, I believe, by idle curiosity, but without

knowledge. You made yourself—ignorantly—my guest; and a guest is

sacred. But now you know my customs and ideas. I am telling you. Never

again can you come here in ignorance; therefore never again can you come

here as a guest; and never again will you pass freely."
He delivered this drily, precisely, with frost in his tones, staring

balefully into my eyes. So taken aback was I by this unleashed hostility

that for a moment I had nothing to say.
"Now, if you please, I will take both notes from that poor idiot: the

one I handed you and the one she handed you."
I realized suddenly that the two lay together in the breast pocket of my

shirt; that though alike in tenor, they differed in phrasing; and that I

had no means of telling one from the other.
"The paper you gave me I read and threw away," I [Pg 31]stated, boldly. "It

meant nothing to me. As to any other, I do not know what you are talking

about."
"You are lying," he said, calmly, as merely stating a fact. "It does not

matter. It is my fancy to collect them. I should have liked to add

yours. Now get out of this, and don't let me see your face again!"
"Mr. Hooper," said I, "I thank you for your hospitality, which has been

complete and generous. You have pointed out the fact that I am no longer

your guest. I can, therefore, with propriety, tell you that your ideas

and prejudices are noted with interest; your wishes are placed on file

for future reference; I don't give a damn for your orders; and you can

go to hell!"
"Fine flow of language. Educated cowpuncher," said the old man, drily.

"You are warned. Keep off. Don't meddle with what does not concern you.

And if the rumour gets back to me that you've been speculating or

talking or criticizing——"
"Well?" I challenged.
"I'll have you killed," he said, simply; so simply that I knew he meant

it.
"You are foolish to make threats," I rejoined. "Two can play at that

game. You drive much alone."
"I do not work alone," he hinted, darkly. "The day my body is found dead

of violence, that day marks the doom of a long list of men whom I

consider inimical to me—like, perhaps, yourself." He stared me down

with his unwinking gaze.

[Pg 32]
CHAPTER V
I returned to Box Springs at a slow jog trot, thinking things over. Old

Man Hooper's warning sobered, but did not act as a deterrent of my

intention to continue with the adventure. But how? I could hardly storm

the fort single handed and carry off the damsel in distress. On the

evidence I possessed I could not even get together a storming party. The

cowboy is chivalrous enough, but human. He would not uprise

spontaneously to the point of war on the mere statement of incarcerated

beauty—especially as ill-treatment was not apparent. I would hardly

last long enough to carry out the necessary proselyting campaign. It

never occurred to me to doubt that Hooper would fulfill his threat of

having me killed, or his ability to do so.
So when the men drifted in two by two at dusk, I said nothing of my real

adventures, and answered their chaff in kind.
"He played the piano for me," I told them the literal truth, "and had me

in to the parlour and dining room. He gave me a room to myself with a

bed and sheets; and he rode out to his pasture gate with me to say

good-bye," and thereby I was branded a delicious liar.
"They took me into the bunk house and fed me, all right," said Windy

Bill, "and fed my horse. And next [Pg 33]morning that old Mexican Joe of his

just nat'rally up and kicked me off the premises."
"Wonder you didn't shoot him," I exclaimed.
"Oh, he didn't use his foot. But he sort of let me know that the place

was unhealthy to visit more'n once. And somehow I seen he meant it; and

I ain't never had no call to go back."
I mulled over the situation all day, and then could stand it no longer.

On the dark of the evening I rode to within a couple of miles of

Hooper's ranch, tied my horse, and scouted carefully forward afoot. For

one thing I wanted to find out whether the system of high transoms

extended to all the rooms, including that in the left wing: for another

I wanted to determine the "lay of the land" on that blank side of the

house. I found my surmise correct as to the transoms. As to the blank

side of the house, that looked down on a wide, green, moist patch and

the irrigating ditch with its stunted willows. Then painstakingly I went

over every inch of the terrain about the ranch; and might just as well

have investigated the external economy of a mud turtle. Realizing that

nothing was to be gained in this manner, I withdrew to my strategic base

where I rolled down and slept until daylight. Then I saddled and

returned toward the ranch.
I had not ridden two miles, however, before in the boulder-strewn wash

of Arroyo Seco I met Jim Starr, one of our men.
"Look here," he said to me. "Jed sent me up to look at the Elder

Springs, but my hoss has done cast a shoe. Cain't you ride up there?"
[Pg 34]"I cannot," said I, promptly. "I've been out all night and had no

breakfast. But you can have my horse."
So we traded horses and separated, each our own way. They sent me out by

Coyote Wells with two other men, and we did not get back until the

following evening.
The ranch was buzzing with excitement. Jim Starr had not returned,

although the ride to Elder Springs was only a two-hour affair. After a

night had elapsed, and still he did not return, two men had been sent.

They found him half way to Elder Springs with a bullet hole in his back.

The bullet was that of a rifle. Being plainsmen they had done good

detective work of its kind, and had determined—by the direction of the

bullet's flight as evidenced by the wound—that it had been fired from a

point above. The only point above was the low "rim" that ran for miles

down the Soda Springs Valley. It was of black lava and showed no tracks.

The men, with a true sense of values, had contented themselves with

covering Jim Starr with a blanket, and then had ridden the rim for some

miles in both directions looking for a trail. None could be discovered.

By this they deduced that the murder was not the result of chance

encounter, but had been so carefully planned that no trace would be left

of the murderer or murderers.
No theory could be imagined save the rather vague one of personal

enmity. Jim Starr was comparatively a newcomer with us. Nobody knew

anything much about him or his relations. Nobody questioned the only man

who could have told anything; and that man did not volunteer to tell

what he knew.
I refer to myself. The thing was sickeningly clear to me. [Pg 35]Jim Starr had

nothing to do with it. I was the man for whom that bullet from the rim

had been intended. I was the unthinking, shortsighted fool who had done

Jim Starr to his death. It had never occurred to me that my midnight

reconnoitring would leave tracks, that Old Man Hooper's suspicious

vigilance would even look for tracks. But given that vigilance, the rest

followed plainly enough. A skillful trailer would have found his way to

where I had mounted; he would have followed my horse to Arroyo Seco

where I had met with Jim Starr. There he would have visualized a rider

on a horse without one shoe coming as far as the Arroyo, meeting me, and

returning whence he had come; and me at once turning off at right

angles. His natural conclusion would be that a messenger had brought me

orders and had returned. The fact that we had shifted mounts he could

not have read, for the reason—as I only too distinctly remembered—that

we had made the change in the boulder and rock stream bed which would

show no clear traces.
The thought that poor Jim Starr, whom I had well liked, had been

sacrificed for me, rendered my ride home with the convoy more deeply

thoughtful than even the tragic circumstances warranted. We laid his

body in the small office, pending Buck Johnson's return from town, and

ate our belated meal in silence. Then we gathered around the corner

fireplace in the bunk house, lit our smokes, and talked it over. Jed

Parker joined us. Usually he sat with our owner in the office.
Hardly had we settled ourselves to discussion when the door opened and

Buck Johnson came in. We had been so [Pg 36]absorbed that no one had heard him

ride up. He leaned his forearm against the doorway at the height of his

head and surveyed the silenced group rather ironically.
"Lucky I'm not nervous and jumpy by nature," he observed. "I've seen

dead men before. Still, next time you want to leave one in my office

after dark, I wish you'd put a light with him, or tack up a sign, or

even leave somebody to tell me about it. I'm sorry it's Starr and not

that thoughtful old horned toad in the corner."
Jed looked foolish, but said nothing. Buck came in, closed the door, and

took a chair square in front of the fireplace. The glow of the leaping

flames was full upon him. His strong face and bulky figure were

revealed, while the other men sat in half shadow. He at once took charge

of the discussion.
"How was he killed?" he inquired, "bucked off?"
"Shot," replied Jed Parker.
Buck's eyebrows came together.
"Who?" he asked.
He was told the circumstances as far as they were known, but declined to

listen to any of the various deductions and surmises.
"Deliberate murder and not a chance quarrel," he concluded. "He wasn't

even within hollering distance of that rim-rock. Anybody know anything

about Starr?"
"He's been with us about five weeks," proffered Jed, as foreman. "Said

he came from Texas."
"He was a Texican," corroborated one of the other men. "I rode with him

considerable."
"What enemies did he have?" asked Buck.
[Pg 37]But it developed that, as far as these men knew, Jim Starr had had no

enemies. He was a quiet sort of a fellow. He had been to town once or

twice. Of course he might have made an enemy, but it was not likely; he

had always behaved himself. Somebody would have known of any trouble——
"Maybe somebody followed him from Texas."
"More likely the usual local work," Buck interrupted. "This man Starr

ever met up with Old Man Hooper or Hooper's men?"
But here was another impasse. Starr had been over on the Slick Rock ever

since his arrival. I could have thrown some light on the matter,

perhaps, but new thoughts were coming to me and I kept silence.
Shortly Buck Johnson went out. His departure loosened tongues, among

them mine.
"I don't see why you stand for this old hombre if he's as bad as you

say," I broke in. "Why don't some of you brave young warriors just

naturally pot him?"
And that started a new line of discussion that left me even more

thoughtful than before. I knew these men intimately. There was not a

coward among them. They had been tried and hardened and tempered in the

fierceness of the desert. Any one of them would have twisted the tail of

the devil himself; but they were off Old Man Hooper. They did not make

that admission in so many words; far from it. And I valued my hide

enough to refrain from pointing the fact. But that fact remained: they

were off Old Man Hooper. Furthermore, by the time they had finished

recounting in intimate detail some scores of anecdotes dealing with what

happened when Old Man Hooper winked his wildcat eye, I [Pg 38]began in spite

of myself to share some of their sentiments. For no matter how flagrant

the killing, nor how certain morally the origin, never had the most

brilliant nor the most painstaking effort been able to connect with the

slayers nor their instigator. He worked in the dark by hidden hands; but

the death from the hands was as certain as the rattlesnake's. Certain of

his victims, by luck or cleverness, seemed to have escaped sometimes as

many as three or four attempts but in the end the old man's Killers got

them.
A Jew drummer who had grossly insulted Hooper in the Lone Star Emporium

had, on learning the enormity of his crime, fled to San Francisco. Three

months later Soda Springs awoke to find pasted by an unknown hand on the

window of the Emporium a newspaper account of that Jew drummer's taking

off. The newspaper could offer no theory and merely recited the fact

that the man suffered from a heavy-calibred bullet. But always the talk

turned back at last to that crowning atrocity, the Boomerang, with its

windrows of little calves, starved for water, lying against the fence.
"Yes," someone unexpectedly answered my first question at last, "someone

could just naturally pot him easy enough. But I got a hunch that he

couldn't get fur enough away to feel safe afterward. The fellow with a

hankering for a good useful kind of suicide could get it right there.

Any candidates? You-all been looking kinda mournful lately, Windy;

s'pose you be the human benefactor and rid the world of this yere

reptile."
"Me?" said Windy with vast surprise, "me mournful? Why, I sing at my

work like a little dicky bird. I'm so [Pg 39]plumb cheerful bull frogs ain't

in it. You ain't talking to me!"
But I wanted one more point of information before the conversation

veered.
"Does his daughter ever ride out?" I asked.
"Daughter?" they echoed in surprise.
"Or niece, or whoever she is," I supplemented impatiently.
"There's no woman there; not even a Mex," said one, and "Did you see any

sign of any woman?" keenly from Windy Bill.
But I was not minded to be drawn.
"Somebody told me about a daughter, or niece, or something," I said,

vaguely.

[Pg 40]
CHAPTER VI
I lay in my bunk and cast things up in my mind. The patch of moonlight

from the window moved slowly across the floor. One of the men was

snoring, but with regularity, so he did not annoy me. The outside

silence was softly musical with all the little voices that at Hooper's

had so disconcertingly lacked. There were crickets—I had forgotten

about them—and frogs, and a hoot owl, and various such matters, beneath

whose influence customarily my consciousness merged into sleep so

sweetly that I never knew when I had lost them. But I was never wider

awake than now, and never had I done more concentrated thinking.
For the moment, and for the moment, only, I was safe. Old Man Hooper

thought he had put me out of the way. How long would he continue to

think so? How long before his men would bring true word of the mistake

that had been made? Perhaps the following day would inform him that Jim

Starr and not myself had been reached by his killer's bullet. Then, I

had no doubt, a second attempt would be made on my life. Therefore,

whatever I was going to do must be done quickly.
I had the choice of war or retreat. Would it do me any good to retreat?

There was the Jew drummer who was killed in San Francisco; and others

whose fates I have not detailed. But why should he particularly desire

my extinction? [Pg 41]What had I done or what knowledge did I possess that had

not been equally done and known by any chance visitor to the ranch? I

remembered the notes in my shirt pocket; and, at the risk of awakening

some of my comrades, I lit a candle and studied them. They were

undoubtedly written by the same hand. To whom had the other been

smuggled? and by what means had it come into Old Man Hooper's

possession? The answer hit me so suddenly, and seemed intrinsically so

absurd, that I blew out the candle and lay again on my back to study it.
And the more I studied it, the less absurd it seemed, not by the light

of reason, but by the feeling of pure intuition. I knew it as sanely as

I knew that the moon made that patch of light through the window. The

man to whom that other note had been surreptitiously conveyed by the

sad-eyed, beautiful girl of the iron-barred chamber was dead; and he was

dead because Old Man Hooper had so willed. And the former owners of the

other notes of the "Collection" concerning which the old man had spoken

were dead, too—dead for the same reason and by the same hidden hands.
Why? Because they knew about the girl? Unlikely. Without doubt Hooper

had, as in my case, himself made possible that knowledge. But I

remembered many things; and I knew that my flash of intuition, absurd as

it might seem at first sight, was true. I recalled the swift, darting

onslaughts with the fly whackers, the fierce, vindictive slaughter of

the frogs, his early-morning pursuit of the flock of migrating birds.

Especially came clear to my recollection the words spoken at breakfast:
"Everything inside the walls is mine! Mine! Mine! [Pg 42]Understand? I will

not tolerate anything that is not mine; that does not obey my will; that

does not come when I say come; go when I say go; and fall silent when I

say be still!"
My crime, the crime of these men from whose dead hands the girl's

appeals had been taken for the "Collection," was that of curiosity! The

old man would within his own domain reign supreme, in the mental as in

the physical world. The chance cowboy, genuinely desirous only of a

resting place for the night, rode away unscathed; but he whom the old

man convicted of a prying spirit committed a lese-majesty that could not

be forgiven. And I had made many tracks during my night reconnaissance.
And the same flash of insight showed me that I would be followed

wherever I went; and the thing that convinced my intuitions—not my

reason—of this was the recollection of the old man stamping the remains

of the poor little bird into the mud by the willows. I saw again the

insane rage of his face; and I felt cold fingers touching my spine.
On this I went abruptly and unexpectedly to sleep, after the fashion of

youth, and did not stir until Sing, the cook, routed us out before dawn.

We were not to ride the range that day because of Jim Starr, but Sing

was a person of fixed habits. I plunged my head into the face of the

dawn with a new and light-hearted confidence. It was one of those clear,

nile-green sunrises whose lucent depths go back a million miles or so;

and my spirit followed on wings. Gone were at once my fine-spun theories

and my forebodings of the night. Life was clean and clear and simple.

Jim Starr had probably some personal enemy. Old Man Hooper was

undoubtedly a mean old lunatic, and dangerous; very likely [Pg 43]he would

attempt to do me harm, as he said, if I bothered him again, but as for

following me to the ends of the earth——
The girl was a different matter. She required thought. So, as I was

hungry and the day sparkling, I postponed her and went in to breakfast.

[Pg 44]
CHAPTER VII
By the time the coroner's inquest and the funeral in town were over it

was three o'clock of the afternoon. As I only occasionally managed Soda

Springs I felt no inclination to hurry on the return journey. My

intention was to watch the Overland through, to make some small

purchases at the Lone Star Emporium, to hoist one or two at McGrue's,

and to dine sumptuously at the best—and only—hotel. A programme simple

in theme but susceptible to variations.
The latter began early. After posing kiddishly as a rough, woolly,

romantic cowboy before the passengers of the Overland, I found myself

chaperoning a visitor to our midst. By sheer accident the visitor had

singled me out for an inquiry.
"Can you tell me how to get to Hooper's ranch?" he asked.
So I annexed him promptly in hope of developments.
He was certainly no prize package, for he was small, pale, nervous,

shifty, and rat-like; and neither his hands nor his eyes were still for

an instant. Further to set him apart he wore a hard-boiled hat, a

flaming tie, a checked vest, a coat cut too tight for even his emaciated

little figure, and long toothpick shoes of patent leather. A fairer mark

for cowboy humour would be difficult to find; but I had a personal

interest and a determined character so the gang took a look at me and

bided their time.
[Pg 45]But immediately I discovered I was going to have my hands full. It

seemed that the little, shifty, rat-faced man had been possessed of a

small handbag which the negro porter had failed to put off the train;

and which was of tremendous importance. At the discovery it was lacking

my new friend went into hysterics. He ran a few feet after the

disappearing train; he called upon high heaven to destroy utterly the

race of negro porters; he threatened terrible reprisals against a

delinquent railroad company; he seized upon a bewildered station agent

over whom he poured his troubles in one gush; and he lifted up his voice

and wept—literally wept! This to the vast enjoyment of my friends.
"What ails the small party?" asked Windy Bill coming up.
"He's lost the family jewels!" "The papers are missing." "Sandy here

(meaning me) won't give him his bottle and it's past feeding time."

"Sandy's took away his stick of candy and won't give it back." "The

little son-of-a-gun's just remembered that he give the nigger porter two

bits," were some of the replies he got.
On the general principle of "never start anything you can't finish," I

managed to quell the disturbance; I got a description of the bag, and

arranged to have it wired for at the next station. On receiving the news

that it could not possibly be returned before the following morning, my

protégé showed signs of another outburst. To prevent it I took him

firmly by the arm and led him across to McGrue's. He was shivering as

though from a violent chill.
The multitude trailed interestedly after; but I took my man into one of

McGrue's private rooms and firmly closed the door.
[Pg 46]"Put that under your belt," I invited, pouring him a half tumbler of

McGrue's best, "and pull yourself together."
He smelled it.
"It's only whiskey," he observed, mournfully. "That won't help much."
"You don't know this stuff," I encouraged.
He took off the half tumbler without a blink, shook his head, and poured

himself another. In spite of his scepticism I thought his nervousness

became less marked.
"Now," said I, "if you don't mind, why do you descend on a peaceful

community and stir it all up because of the derelictions of an absent

coon? And why do you set such store by your travelling bag? And why do

you weep in the face of high heaven and outraged manhood? And why do you

want to find Hooper's ranch? And why are you and your vaudeville make

up?"
But he proved singularly embarrassed and nervous and uncommunicative,

darting his glance here and there about him, twisting his hands, never

by any chance meeting my eye. I leaned back and surveyed him in

considerable disgust.
"Look here, brother," I pointed out to him. "You don't seem to realize.

A man like you can't get away with himself in this country except behind

footlights—and there ain't any footlights. All I got to do is to throw

open yonder door and withdraw my beneficent protection and you will be

set upon by a pack of ravening wolves with their own ideas of humour,

among whom I especially mention one Windy Bill. I'm about the only thing

that looks like a friend you've got."
He caught at the last sentence only.
[Pg 47]"You my friend?" he said, breathlessly, "then tell me: is there a

doctor around here?"
"No," said I, looking at him closely, "not this side of Tucson. Are you

sick?"
"Is there a drug store in town, then?"
"Nary drug store."
He jumped to his feet, knocking over his chair as he did so.
"My God!" he cried in uncontrollable excitement, "I've got to get my

bag! How far is it to the next station where they're going to put it

off? Ain't there some way of getting there? I got to get to my bag."
"It's near to forty miles," I replied, leaning back.
"And there's no drug store here? What kind of a bum tank town is this,

anyhow?"
"They keep a few patent medicines and such over at the Lone Star

Emporium——" I started to tell him. I never had a chance to finish my

sentence. He darted around the table, grabbed me by the arm, and urged

me to my feet.
"Show me!" he panted.
We sailed through the bar room under full head of steam, leaving the

gang staring after us open-mouthed. I could feel we were exciting

considerable public interest. At the Lone Star Emporium the little freak

looked wildly about him until his eyes fell on the bottle shelves. Then

he rushed right in behind the counter and began to paw them over. I

headed off Sol Levi, who was coming front making war medicine.
"Loco," says I to him. "If there's any damage, I'll settle."
It looked like there was going to be damage all right, the way he

snatched up one bottle after the other, read the [Pg 48]labels, and thrust

them one side. At last he uttered a crow of delight, just like a kid.
"How many you got of these?" he demanded, holding up a bottle of

soothing syrup.
"You only take a tablespoon of that stuff——" began Sol.
"How many you got—how much are they?" interrupted the stranger.
"Six—three dollars a bottle," says Sol, boosting the price.
The little man peeled a twenty off a roll of bills and threw it down.
"Keep the other five bottles for me!" he cried in a shaky voice, and ran

out, with me after him, forgetting his change and to shut the door

behind us.
Back through McGrue's bar we trailed like one of these moving-picture

chases and into the back room.
"Well, here we are home again," said I.
The stranger grabbed a glass and filled it half full of soothing syrup.
"Here, you aren't going to drink that!" I yelled at him. "Didn't you

hear Sol tell you the dose is a spoonful?"
But he didn't pay me any attention. His hand was shaking so he could

hardly connect with his own mouth, and he was panting as though he'd run

a race.
"Well, no accounting for tastes," I said. "Where do you want me to ship

your remains?"
He drank her down, shut his eyes a few minutes, and held still. He had

quit his shaking, and he looked me square in the face.
"What's it to you?" he demanded. "Huh? Ain't you never seen a guy hit

the hop before?"
[Pg 49]He stared at me so truculently that I was moved to righteous wrath; and

I answered him back. I told him what I thought of him and his clothes

and his conduct at quite some length. When I had finished he seemed to

have gained a new attitude of aggravating wise superiority.
"That's all right, kid; that's all right," he assured me; "keep your

hair on. I ain't such a bad scout; but you gotta get used to me. Give me

my hop and I'm all right. Now about this Hooper; you say you know him?"
"None better," I rejoined. "But what's that to you? That's a fair

question."
He bored me with his beady rat eyes for several seconds.
"Friend of yours?" he asked, briefly.
Something in the intonations of his voice induced me to frankness.
"I have good cause to think he's trying to kill me," I replied.
He produced a pocketbook, fumbled in it for a moment, and laid before me

a clipping. It was from the Want column of a newspaper, and read as

follows:
A.A.B.—Will deal with you on your terms. H.H.
"A.A.B. that's me—Artie Brower. And H.H.—that's him—Henry Hooper," he

explained. "And that lil' piece of paper means that's he's caved, come

off, war's over. Means I'm rich, that I can have my own ponies if I want

to, 'stead of touting somebody else's old dogs. It means that I got old

H.H.—Henry Hooper—where the hair is short, and he's got to come my

way!"
His eyes were glittering restlessly, and the pupils seemed [Pg 50]to be unduly

dilated. The whiskey and opium together—probably an unaccustomed

combination—were too much for his ill-balanced control. Every

indication of his face and his narrow eyes was for secrecy and craft;

yet for the moment he was opening up to me, a stranger, like an oyster.

Even my inexperience could see that much, and I eagerly took advantage

of my chance.
"You are a horseman, then?" I suggested.
"Me a horseman? Say, kid, you didn't get my name. Brower—Artie Brower.

Why, I've ridden more winning races than any other man on the Pacific

Coast. That's how I got onto old H.H. I rode for him. He knows a good

horse all right—the old skunk. Used to have a pretty string."
"He's got at least one good Morgan stallion now," said I. "I've seen him

at Hooper's ranch."
"I know the old crock—trotter," scorned the true riding jockey.

"Probably old Tim Westmore is hanging around, too. He's in love with

that horse."
"Is he in love with Hooper, too?" I asked.
"Just like I am," said the jockey with a leer.
"So you're going to be rich," said I. "How's that?"
He leered at me again, going foxy.
"Don't you wish you knew! But I'll tell you this: old H.H. is going to

give me all I want—just because I ask him to."
I took another tack, affecting incredulity.
"The hell he is! He'll hand you over to Ramon and that will be the last

of a certain jockey."
"No, he won't do no such trick. I've fixed that; and he [Pg 51]knows it. If he

kills me, he'll lose all he's got 'stead of only part."
"You're drunk or dreaming," said I. "If you bother him, he'll just plain

have you killed. That's a little way of his."
"And if he does a friend of mine will just go to a certain place and get

certain papers and give 'em to a certain lawyer—and then where's old

H.H.? And he knows it, damn well. And he's going to be good to Artie and

give him what he wants. We'll get along fine. Took him a long time to

come to it; but I didn't take no chances while he was making up his

mind; you can bet on that."
"Blackmail, eh?" I said, with just enough of a sneer to fire him.
"Blackmail nothing!" he shouted. "It ain't blackmail to take away what

don't belong to a man at all!"
"What don't belong to him?"
"Nothing. Not a damn thing except his money. This ranch. The oil wells

in California. The cattle. Not a damn thing. That was the agreement with

his pardner when they split. And I've got the agreement! Now what you

got to say?"
"Say? Why its loco! Why doesn't the pardner raise a row?"
"He's dead."
"His heirs then?"
"He hasn't got but one heir—his daughter." My heart skipped a beat in

the amazement of a half idea. "And she knew nothing about the agreement.

Nobody knows but old H.H.—and me." He sat back, visibly gloating over

me. But his mood was passing. His earlier [Pg 52]exhilaration had died, and

with it was dying the expansiveness of his confidence. The triumph of

his last speech savoured he slipped again into his normal self. He

looked at me suspiciously, and raised his whiskey to cover his

confusion.
"What's it to yuh, anyway?" he muttered into his glass darkly. His eyes

were again shifting here and there; and his lips were snarled back

malevolently to show his teeth.
At this precise moment the lords of chance willed Windy Bill and others

to intrude on our privacy by opening the door and hurling several

whiskey-flavoured sarcasms at the pair of us. The jockey seemed to

explode after the fashion of an over-inflated ball. He squeaked like a

rat, leaped to his feet, hurled the chair on which he had been sitting

crash against the door from which Windy Bill et al had withdrawn

hastily, and ended by producing a small wicked-looking automatic—then a

new and strange weapon—and rushing out into the main saloon. There he

announced that he was known to the cognoscenti as Art the Blood and was

a city gunman in comparison with which these plain, so-called bad men

were as sucking doves to the untamed eagle. Thence he glanced briefly at

their ancestry as far as known; and ended by rushing forth in the

general direction of McCloud's hotel.
"Suffering giraffes!" gasped Windy Bill after the whirlwind had passed.

"Was that the scared little rabbit that wept all them salt tears over at

the depot? What brand of licker did you feed him, Sandy?"
I silently handed him the bottle.
"Soothing syrup—my God!" said Windy in hushed tones.

[Pg 53]
CHAPTER VIII
At that epoch I prided myself on being a man of resource; and I

proceeded to prove it in a fashion that even now fills me with

satisfaction. I annexed the remainder of that bottle of soothing syrup;

I went to Sol Levi and easily procured delivery of the other five. Then

I strolled peacefully to supper over at McCloud's hotel. Pathological

knowledge of dope fiends was outside my ken—I could not guess how soon

my man would need another dose of his "hop," but I was positively sure

that another would be needed. Inquiry of McCloud elicited the fact that

the ex-jockey had swallowed a hasty meal and had immediately retired to

Room 4. I found Room 4 unlocked, and Brower lying fully clothed sound

asleep across the bed. I did not disturb him, except that I robbed him

of his pistol. All looked safe for awhile; but just to be certain I took

Room 6, across the narrow hall, and left both doors open. McCloud's

hotel never did much of a room business. By midnight the cowboys would

be on their way for the ranches. Brower and myself were the only

occupants of the second floor.
For two hours I smoked and read. The ex-jockey did not move a muscle.

Then I went to bed and to a sound sleep; but I set my mind like an alarm

clock, so that the slightest move from the other room would have fetched

me broad awake. City-bred people may not know that this [Pg 54]can be done by

most outdoor men. I have listened subconsciously to horsebells for so

many nights, for example, that even on stormy nights the cessation of

that faint twinkle will awaken me, while the crash of the elements or

even the fall of a tree would not in the slightest disturb my tired

slumbers. So now, although the songs and stamping and racket of the

revellers below stairs in McCloud's bar did not for one second prevent

my falling into deep and dreamless sleep, Brower's softest tread would

have reached my consciousness.
However, he slept right through the night, and was still dead to the

world when I slipped out at six o'clock to meet the east-bound train.

The bag—a small black Gladstone—was aboard in charge of the

baggageman. I had no great difficulty in getting it from my friend, the

station agent. Had he not seen me herding the locoed stranger? I

secreted the black bag with the five full bottles of soothing syrup,

slipped the half-emptied bottle in my pocket, and returned to the hotel.

There I ate breakfast, and sat down for a comfortable chat with McCloud

while awaiting results.
Got them very promptly. About eight o'clock Brower came downstairs. He

passed through the office, nodding curtly to McCloud and me, and into

the dining room where he drank several cups of coffee. Thence he passed

down the street toward Sol Levi's. He emerged rather hurriedly and

slanted across to the station.
"In about two minutes," I observed to McCloud, "you're going to observe

yon butterfly turn into a stinging lizard. He's going to head in this

direction; and he'll probably aim to climb my hump. Such being the case,

and the affair [Pg 55]being private, you'll do me a favour by supervising

something in some remote corner of the premises."
"Sure," said McCloud, "I'll go twist that Chink washee-man. Been

intending to for a week." And he stumped out on his wooden foot.
The comet hit at precisely 7:42 by McCloud's big clock. Its head was

Brower at high speed and tension; and its tail was the light alkali dust

of Arizona mingled with the station agent. No irresistible force and

immovable body proposition in mine; I gave to the impact.
"Why, sure, I got 'em for you," I answered. "You left your dope lying

around loose so I took care of it for you. As for your bag; you seemed

to set such store by it that I got that for you, too."
Which deflated that particular enterprise for the moment, anyway. The

station agent, too mad to spit, departed before he should be tempted

beyond his strength to resist homicide.
"I suppose you're taking care of my gun for me, too," said Brower; but

his irony was weak. He was evidently off the boil.
"Your gun?" I echoed. "Have you lost your gun?"
He passed his hand across his eyes. His super-excitement had passed,

leaving him weak and nervous. Now was the time for my counter-attack.
"Here's your gun," said I, "didn't want to collect any lead while you

were excited, and I've got your dope," I repeated, "in a safe place." I

added, "and you'll not see any of it again until you answer me a few

questions, and answer them straight."
[Pg 56]"If you think you can roll me for blackmail," he came back with some

decision, "you're left a mile."
"I don't want a cent; but I do want a talk."
"Shoot," said he.
"How often do you have to have this dope—for the best results; and how

much of it at a shot?"
He stared at me for a moment, then laughed.
"What's it to yuh?" he repeated his formula.
"I want to know."
"I get to needing it about once a day. Three grains will carry me by."
"All right; that's what I want to know. Now listen to me. I'm custodian

of this dope, and you'll get your regular ration as long as you stick

with me."
"I can always hop a train. This ain't the only hamlet on the map," he

reminded me.
"That's always what you can do if you find we can't work together.

That's where you've got me if my proposition doesn't sound good."
"What is your proposition?" he asked after a moment.
"Before I tell you, I'm going to give you a few pointers on what you're

up against. I don't know how much you know about Old Man Hooper, but

I'll bet there's plenty you don't know about."
I proceeded to tell him something of the old man's methods, from the

"boomerang" to vicarious murder.
"And he gets away with it?" asked Brower when I had finished.
"He certainly does," said I. "Now," I continued, "you may be solid as a

brick church, and your plans may [Pg 57]be water-tight, and old Hooper may

kill the fatted four-year-old, for all I know. But if I were you, I

wouldn't go sasshaying all alone out to Hooper's ranch. It's altogether

too blame confiding and innocent."
"If anything happens to me, I've left directions for those contracts to

be recorded," he pointed out. "Old Hooper knows that."
"Oh, sure!" I replied, "just like that! But one day your trustworthy

friend back yonder will get a letter in your well-known hand-write that

will say that all is well and the goose hangs high, that the old man is

a prince and has come through, and that in accordance with the nice,

friendly agreement you have reached he—your friend—will hand over the

contract to a very respectable lawyer herein named, and so forth and so

on, ending with your equally well-known John Hancock."
"Well, that's all right."
"I hadn't finished the picture. In the meantime, you will be getting out

of it just one good swift kick, and that is all."
"I shouldn't write any such letter. Not 'till I felt the feel of the

dough."
"Not at first you wouldn't," I said, softly. "Certainly not at first.

But after a while you would. These renegade Mexicans—like Hooper's

Ramon, for example—know a lot of rotten little tricks. They drive

pitch-pine splinters into your legs and set fire to them, for one thing.

Or make small cuts in you with a knife, and load them up with powder

squibs in oiled paper—so the blood won't wet them—and touch them off.

And so on. When you've been shown [Pg 58]about ten per cent, of what old Ramon

knows about such things, you'll write most any kind of a letter."
"My God!" he muttered, thrusting the ridiculous derby to the back of his

head.
"So you see you'd look sweet walking trustfully into Hooper's claws.

That's what that newspaper ad was meant for. And when the respectable

lawyer wrote that the contract had been delivered, do you know what

would happen to you?"
The ex-jockey shuddered.
"But you've only told me part of what I want to know," I pursued. "You

got me side-tracked. This daughter of the dead pardner—this girl, what

about her? Where is she now?"
"Europe, I believe."
"When did she go?"
"About three months ago."
"Any other relatives?"
"Not that I know of."
"H'm," I pondered. "What does she look like?"
"She's about medium height, dark, good figure, good-looking all right.

She's got eyes wide apart and a wide forehead. That's the best I can do.

Why?"
"Anybody heard from her since she went to Europe?"
"How should I know?" rejoined Brower, impatiently. "What you driving

at?"
"I think I've seen her. I believe she's not in Europe at all. I believe

she's a prisoner at the ranch."
"My aunt!" ejaculated Brower. His nervousness was increasing—the

symptoms I was to recognize so well. "Why [Pg 59]the hell don't you just shoot

him from behind a bush? I'll do it, if you won't."
"He's too smooth for that." And I told him what Hooper had told me. "His

hold on these Mexicans is remarkable. I don't doubt that fifty of the

best killers in the southwest have lists of the men Old Man Hooper

thinks might lay him out. And every man on that list would get his

within a year—without any doubt. I don't doubt that partner's daughter

would go first of all. You, too, of course."
"My aunt!" groaned the jockey again.
"He's a killer," I went on, "by nature, and by interest—a bad

combination. He ought to be tramped out like a rattlesnake. But this is

a new country, and it's near the border. I expect he's got me marked. If

I have to I'll kill him just like I would a rattlesnake; but that

wouldn't do me a whole lot of good and would probably get a bunch

assassinated. I'd like to figure something different. So you see you'd

better come on in while the coming is good."
"I see," said the ex-jockey, very much subdued. "What's your idea? What

do you want me to do?"
That stumped me. To tell the truth I had no idea at all what to do.
"I don't want you to go out to Hooper's ranch alone," said I.
"Trust me!" he rejoined, fervently.
"I reckon the first best thing is to get along out of town," I

suggested. "That black bag all the plunder you got?"
"That's it."
"Then we'll go out a-horseback."
[Pg 60]We had lunch and a smoke and settled up with McCloud. About

mid-afternoon we went on down to the livery corral. I knew the keeper

pretty well, of course, so I borrowed a horse and saddle for Brower. The

latter looked with extreme disfavour on both.
"This is no race meet," I reminded him. "This is a means of

transportation."
"Sorry I ain't got nothing better," apologized Meigs, to whom I had

confided my companion's profession—I had to account for such a figure

somehow. "All my saddle hosses went off with a mine outfit yesterday."
"What's the matter with that chestnut in the shed?"
"He's all right; fine beast. Only it ain't mine. It belongs to Ramon."
"Ramon from Hooper's?"
"Yeah."
"I'd let you ride my horse and take Meigs's old skate myself," I said to

Brower, "but when you first get on him this bronc of mine is a

rip-humming tail twister. Ain't he, Meigs?"
"He's a bad caballo," corroborated Meigs.
"Does he buck?" queried Brower, indifferently.
"Every known fashion. Bites, scratches, gouges, and paws. Want to try

him?"
"I got a headache," replied Brower, grouchily. "Bring out your old dog."
When I came back from roping and blindfolding the twisted dynamite I was

engaged in "gentling," I found that Brower was saddling the mournful

creature with my saddle. My expostulation found him very snappy and

[Pg 61]very arbitrary. His opium-irritated nerves were beginning to react. I

realized that he was not far short of explosive obstinacy. So I conceded

the point; although, as every rider knows, a cowboy's saddle and a

cowboy's gun are like unto a toothbrush when it comes to lending. Also

it involved changing the stirrup length on the livery saddle. I needed

things just right to ride Tiger through the first five minutes.
When I had completed this latter operation, Brower had just finished

drawing tight the cinch. His horse stood dejectedly. When Brower had

made fast the latigo, the horse—as such dispirited animals often

do—heaved a deep sigh. Something snapped beneath the slight strain of

the indrawn breath.
"Dogged if your cinch ain't busted!" cried Meigs with a loud laugh.

"Lucky for you your friend did borrow your saddle! If you'd clumb Tiger

with that outfit you could just naturally have begun pickin' out the

likely-looking she-angels."
I dropped the stirrup and went over to examine the damage. Both of the

quarter straps on the off side had given way. I found that they had been

cut nearly through with a sharp knife. My eye strayed to Ramon's

chestnut horse standing under the shed.

[Pg 62]
CHAPTER IX
We jogged out to Box Springs by way of the lower alkali flats. It is

about three miles farther that way; but one can see for miles in every

direction. I did not one bit fancy the cañons, the mesquite patches, and

the open ground of the usual route.
I beguiled the distance watching Brower. The animal he rode was a

hammer-headed, ewe-necked beast with a disconsolate eye and a half-shed

winter coat. The ex-jockey was not accustomed to a stock saddle. He had

shortened his stirrups beyond all reason so that his knees and his

pointed shoes and his elbows stuck out at all angles. He had thrust his

derby hat far down over his ears, and buttoned his inadequate coat

tightly. In addition, he was nourishing a very considerable grouch,

attributable, I suppose, to the fact that his customary dose was just

about due. Tiger could not be blamed for dancing wide. Evening was

falling, the evening of the desert when mysterious things seem to swell

and draw imminent out of unguessed distances. I could not help wondering

what these gods of the desert could be thinking of us.
However, as we drew imperceptibly nearer the tiny patch of cottonwoods

that marked Box Springs, I began to realize that it would be more to the

point to wonder what that gang of hoodlums in the bunk house was going

to think of us. [Pg 63]The matter had been fairly well carried off up to that

moment, but I could not hope for a successful repetition. No man could

continue to lug around with him so delicious a vaudeville sketch without

some concession to curiosity. Nor could any mortal for long wear such

clothes in the face of Arizona without being required to show cause. He

had got away with it last night, by surprise; but that would be about

all.
At my fiftieth attempt to enter into conversation with him, I

unexpectedly succeeded. I believe I was indicating the points of

interest. You can see farther in Arizona than any place I know, so there

was no difficulty about that. I'd pointed out the range of the

Chiracahuas, and Cochise's Stronghold, and the peaks of the Galiuros and

other natural sceneries; I had showed him mesquite and yucca, and mescal

and soapweed, and sage, and sacatone and niggerheads and all the other

known vegetables of the region. Also I'd indicated prairie dogs and

squinch owls and Gambel's quail and road runners and a couple of coyotes

and lizards and other miscellaneous fauna. Not to speak of naming

painstakingly the ranches indicated by the clumps of trees that you

could just make out as little spots in the distance—Box Springs, the

O.T., the Double H, Fort Shafter, and Hooper's. He waked up and paid a

little attention at this; and I thought I might get a little friendly

talk out of him. A cowboy rides around alone so much he sort of likes to

josh when he has anybody with him. This "strong silent" stuff doesn't go

until you've used around with a man quite some time.
I got the talk, all right, but it didn't have a thing to do [Pg 64]with

topography or natural history. Unless you call the skate he was riding

natural history. That was the burden of his song. He didn't like that

horse, and he didn't care who knew it. It was an uncomfortable horse to

ride on, it required exertion to keep in motion, and it hurt his

feelings. Especially the last. He was a horseman, a jockey, he'd ridden

the best blood in the equine world; and here he was condemned through no

fault of his own to straddle a cross between a llama and a woolly toy

sheep. It hurt his pride. He felt bitterly about it. Indeed, he fairly

harped on the subject.
"Is that horse of yours through bucking for the day?" he asked at last.
"Certain thing. Tiger never pitches but the once."
"Let me ride him a ways. I'd like to feel a real horse to get the taste

of this kangaroo out of my system."
I could see he was jumpy, so I thought I'd humour him.
"Swing on all at once and you're all right," I advised him. "Tiger don't

like fumbling in getting aboard."
He grunted scornfully.
"Those stirrups are longer than the ones you've been using. Want to

shorten them?"
He did not bother to answer, but mounted in a decisive manner that

proved he was indeed a horseman, and a good one. I climbed old crow bait

and let my legs hang.
The jockey gathered the reins and touched Tiger with his heels. I kicked

my animal with my stock spurs and managed to extract a lumbering sort of

gallop.
"Hey, slow up!" I called after a few moments. "I can't keep up with

you."
[Pg 65]Brower did not turn his head, nor did Tiger slow up. After twenty

seconds I realized that he intended to do neither. I ceased urging on my

animal, there was no use tiring us both; evidently the jockey was

enjoying to the full the exhilaration of a good horse, and we would

catch up at Box Springs. I only hoped the boys wouldn't do anything

drastic to him before my arrival.
So I jogged along at the little running walk possessed by even the most

humble cattle horse, and enjoyed the evening. It was going on toward

dusk and pools of twilight were in the bottomlands. For the moment the

world had grown smaller, more intimate, as the skies expanded. The dust

from Brower's going did not so much recede as grow littler, more

toy-like. I watched idly his progress.
At a point perhaps a mile this side the Box Springs ranch the road

divides: the right-hand fork leading to the ranch house, the left on up

the valley. After a moment I noticed that the dust was on the left-hand

fork. I swore aloud.
"The damn fool has taken the wrong road!" and then after a moment, with

dismay: "He's headed straight for Hooper's ranch!"
I envisaged the full joy and rapture of this thought for perhaps half a

minute. It sure complicated matters, what with old Hooper gunning on my

trail, and this partner's daughter shut up behind bars. Me, I expected

to last about two days unless I did something mighty sudden. Brower I

expected might last approximately half that time, depending on how soon

Ramon et al got busy. The girl I didn't know anything about, nor did I

want to at that moment. I was plenty worried about my own precious [Pg 66]hide

just then. And if you think you are going to get a love story out of

this, I warn you again to quit right now; you are not.
Brower was going to walk into that gray old spider's web like a nice fat

fly. And he was going to land without even the aid and comfort of his

own particular brand of Dutch courage. For safety's sake, and because of

Tiger's playful tendencies when first mounted, we had tied the famous

black bag—which now for convenience contained also the soothing

syrup—behind the cantle of Meigs's old nag. Which said nag I now

possessed together with all appurtenances and attachments thereunto

appertaining I tried to speculate on the reactions of Old Man Hooper,

Ramon, Brower and no dope, but it was too much for me. My head was

getting tired thinking about all these complicated things, anyhow. I was

accustomed to nice, simple jobs with my head, like figuring on the

shrinkage of beef cattle, or the inner running of a two-card draw. All

this annoyed me. I began to get mad. When I got mad enough I cussed and

came to a decision: which was to go after Old Man Hooper and all his

works that very night. Next day wouldn't do; I wanted action right off

quick. Naturally I had no plans, nor even a glimmering of what I was

going to do about it; but you bet you I was going to do something! As

soon as it was dark I was going right on up there. Frontal attack, you

understand. As to details, those would take care of themselves as the

affair developed. Having come to which sapient decision I shoved the

whole irritating mess over the edge of my mind and rode on quite happy.

I told you at the start of this yarn that I was a kid.
[Pg 67]My mind being now quite easy as to my future actions, I gave thought to

the first step. That was supper. There seemed to me no adequate reason,

with a fine, long night before me, why I shouldn't use a little of the

shank end of it to stoke up for the rest. So I turned at the right-hand

fork and jogged slowly toward our own ranch.
Of course I had the rotten luck to find most of the boys still at the

water corral. When they saw who was the lone horseman approaching

through the dusk of the spring twilight, and got a good fair look at the

ensemble, they dropped everything and came over to see about it, headed

naturally by those mournful blights, Windy Bill and Wooden. In solemn

silence they examined my outfit, paying not the slightest attention to

me. At the end of a full minute they looked at each other.
"What do you think, Sam?" asked Windy.
"My opinion is not quite formed, suh," replied Wooden, who was a

Texican. "But my first examination inclines me to the belief that it is

a hoss."
"Yo're wrong, Sam," denied Windy, sadly; "yo're judgment is confused by

the fact that the critter carries a saddle. Look at the animile itself."
"I have done it," continued Sam Wooden; "at first glance I should agree

with you. Look carefully, Windy. Examine the details; never mind the

toot enscramble. It's got hoofs."
"So's a cow, a goat, a burro, a camel, a hippypottamus, and the devil,"

pointed out Windy.
"Of course I may be wrong," acknowledged Wooden. "On second examination

I probably am wrong. But if it ain't a hoss, then what is it? Do you

know?"
[Pg 68]"It's a genuine royal gyasticutus," esserted Windy Bill, positively. "I

seen one once. It has one peculiarity that you can't never fail to

identify it by."
"What's that?"
"It invariably travels around with a congenital idiot."
Wooden promptly conceded that, but claimed the identification not

complete as he doubted whether, strictly speaking, I could be classified

as a congenital idiot. Windy pointed out that evidently I had traded

Tiger for the gyasticutus. Wooden admitted that this proved me an idiot,

but not necessarily a congenital idiot.
This colloquy—and more like it—went on with entire gravity. The other

men were hanging about relishing the situation, but without a symptom of

mirth. I was unsaddling methodically, paying no attention to anybody,

and apparently deaf to all that was being said. If the two old fools had

succeeded in eliciting a word from me they would have been entirely

happy; but I knew that fact, and shut my lips.
I hung my saddle on the rack and was just about to lead the old skate to

water when we all heard the sound of a horse galloping on the road.
"It's a light boss," said somebody after a moment, meaning a horse

without a burden.
We nodded and resumed our occupation. A stray horse coming in to water

was nothing strange or unusual. But an instant later, stirrups swinging,

reins flapping, up dashed my own horse, Tiger.

[Pg 69]
CHAPTER X
All this being beyond me, and then some, I proceeded methodically to

carry out my complicated plan; which was, it will be remembered, to eat

supper and then to go and see about it in person. I performed the first

part of this to my entire satisfaction but not to that of the rest. They

accused me of unbecoming secrecy; only they expressed it differently.

That did not worry me, and in due time I made my escape. At the corral I

picked out a good horse, one that I had brought from the Gila, that

would stay tied indefinitely without impatience. Then I lighted me a

cigarette and jogged up the road. I carried with me a little grub, my

six-gun, the famous black bag, and an entirely empty head.
The night was only moderately dark, for while there was no moon there

were plenty of those candle-like desert stars. The little twinkling

lights of the Box Springs dropped astern like lamps on a shore. By and

by I turned off the road and made a wide détour down the sacatone

bottoms, for I had still some sense; and roads were a little too

obvious. The reception committee that had taken charge of my little

friend might be expecting another visitor—me. This brought my approach

to the blank side of the ranch where were the willow trees and the

irrigating ditch. I rode up as close as I thought I ought to. Then I

tied my horse to a [Pg 70]prominent lone Joshua-tree that would be easy to

find, unstrapped the black bag, and started off. The black bag, however,

bothered me; so after some thought I broke the lock with a stone and

investigated the contents, mainly by feel. There were a lot of clothes

and toilet articles and such junk, and a number of undetermined hard

things like round wooden boxes. Finally I withdrew to the shelter of a

barranca where I could light matches. Then I had no difficulty in

identifying a nice compact little hypodermic outfit, which I slipped

into a pocket. I then deposited the bag in a safe place where I could

find it easily.
Leaving my horse I approached the ranch under cover of the willows. Yes,

I remembered this time that I left tracks, but I did not care. My idea

was to get some sort of decisive action before morning. Once through the

willows I crept up close to the walls. They were twelve or fifteen feet

high, absolutely smooth; and with one exception broken only by the long,

narrow loopholes or transoms I have mentioned before. The one exception

was a small wicket gate or door. I remembered the various sorties with

torches after the chirping frogs, and knew that by this opening the

hunting party had emerged. This and the big main gate were the only

entrances to the enclosure.
I retired to the vicinity of the willows and uttered the cry of the

barred owl. After ten seconds I repeated it, and so continued. My only

regret was that I could not chirp convincingly like a frog. I saw a

shadow shift suddenly through one of the transoms, and at once glided to

the wall near the little door. After a moment or so it opened to emit

Old Man Hooper and another bulkier figure which [Pg 71]I imagined to be that

of Ramon. Both were armed with shotguns. Suddenly it came to me that I

was lucky not to have been able to chirp convincingly like a frog. They

hunted frogs with torches and in a crowd. Those two carried no light and

they were so intent on making a sneak on the willows and the

supposititious owl that I, flattened in the shadow of the wall, easily

escaped their notice. I slipped inside the doorway.
This brought me into a narrow passage between two buildings. The other

end looked into the interior court. A careful reconnaissance showed no

one in sight, so I walked boldly along the verandah in the direction of

the girl's room. Her note had said she was constantly guarded; but I

could see no one in sight, and I had to take a chance somewhere. Two

seconds' talk would do me: I wanted to know in which of the numerous

rooms the old man slept. I had a hunch it would be a good idea to share

that room with him. What to do then I left to the hunch.
But when I was half way down the verandah I heard the wicket door

slammed shut. The owl hunters had returned more quickly than I had

anticipated. Running as lightly as possible I darted down the verandah

and around the corner of the left wing. This brought me into a narrow

little garden strip between the main house and the wall dividing the

court from the corrals and stable yards. Footsteps followed me but

stopped. A hand tried the door knob to the corner room.
"Nothing," I heard Hooper's voice replying to a question. "Nothing at

all. Go to sleep."
The fragrant smell of Mexican tobacco reached my nostrils. [Pg 72]After a

moment Ramon—it was he—resumed a conversation in Spanish:
"I do not know, señor, who the man was. I could but listen; it was not

well to inquire nor to show too much interest. His name, yes; Jim Starr,

but who he is——" I could imagine the shrug. "It is of no importance."
"It is of importance that the other man still lives," broke in Hooper's

harsher voice. "I will not have it, I say! Are you sure of it?"
"I saw him. And I saw his horse at the Señor Meigs. It was the brown

that bucks badly, so I cut the quarter straps of his saddle. It might be

that we have luck; I do not count on it. But rest your mind easy, señor,

it shall be arranged."
"It better be."
"But there is more, señor. The señor will remember a man who rode in

races for him many years ago, one named Artie——"
"Brower!" broke in Hooper. "What about him?"
"He is in town. He arrived yesterday afternoon."
Hooper ejaculated something.
"And more, he is all day and all night with this Sanborn."
Hooper swore fluently in English.
"Look, Ramon!" he ordered, vehemently. "It is necessary to finish this

Sanborn at once, without delay."
"Bueno, señor."
"It must not go over a single day."
"Haste makes risk, señor."
"The risk must be run."
"Bueno, señor. And also this Artie?"
[Pg 73]"No! no! no!" hastened Hooper. "Guard him as your life! But send a

trusty man for him to-morrow with the buckboard. He comes to see me, in

answer to my invitation."
"And if he will not come, señor?" inquired Ramon's quiet voice.
"Why should he not come?"
"He has been much with Sanborn."
"It's necessary that he come," replied Hooper, emphasizing each word.
"Bueno, señor."
"Who is to be on guard?"
"Cortinez, señor."
"I will send him at once. Do me the kindness to watch for a moment until

I send him. Here is the key; give it to him. It shall be but a moment."
"Bueno, señor," replied Ramon.
He leaned against the corner of the house. I could see the half of his

figure against the sky and the dim white of the walls.
The night was very still, as always at this ranch. There was not even a

breeze to create a rustle in the leaves. I was obliged to hold rigidly

motionless, almost to hush my breathing, while the figure bulked large

against the whitewashed wall. But my eyes, wide to the dimness, took in

every detail of my surroundings. Near me stood a water barrel. If I

could get a spring from that water barrel I could catch one of the heavy

projecting beams of the roof.
After an apparently interminable interval the sound of footsteps became

audible, and a moment later Ramon moved to meet his relief. I seized the

opportunity of their [Pg 74]conversation and ascended to the roof. It proved

to be easy, although the dried-out old beam to which for a moment I

swung creaked outrageously. Probably it sounded louder to me than the

actual fact. I took off my boots and moved cautiously to where I could

look down into the court. Ramon and his companion were still talking

under the verandah, so I could not see them; but I waited until I heard

one of them move away. Then I went to seat myself on the low parapet and

think things over.
The man below me had the key to the girl's room. If I could get the key

I could accomplish the first step of my plan—indeed the only step I had

determined upon. The exact method of getting the key would have to

develop. In the meantime, I gave passing wonder to the fact, as

developed by the conversation between Hooper and Ramon, that Brower was

not at the ranch and had not been heard of at the ranch. Where had Tiger

dumped him, and where now was he lying? I keenly regretted the loss of a

possible ally; and, much to my astonishment, I found within myself a

little regret for the man himself.
The thought of the transom occurred to me. I tiptoed over to that side

and looked down. The opening was about five feet below the parapet.

After a moment's thought I tied a bit of stone from the coping in the

end of my silk bandana and lowered it at arm's length. By swinging it

gently back and forth I determined that the transom was open. With the

stub of the pencil every cowboy carried to tally with I scribbled a few

words on an envelope which I wrapped about the bit of coping. Something

to the effect that I was there, and expected to gain entrance to her

room [Pg 75]later, and to be prepared. Then I lowered my contraption, caused

it to tap gently a dozen times on the edge of the transom, and finally

swung it with a rather nice accuracy to fly, bandana and all, through

the opening. After a short interval of suspense I saw the reflection of

a light and so knew my message had been received.
There was nothing to do now but return to a point of observation. On my

way I stubbed my stockinged foot against a stone metate or mortar in

which Indians and Mexicans make their flour. The heavy pestle was there.

I annexed it. Dropped accurately from the height of the roof it would

make a very pretty weapon. The trouble, of course, lay in that word

"accurately."
But I soon found the fates playing into my hands. At the end of a

quarter hour the sentry emerged from under the verandah, looked up at

the sky, yawned, stretched, and finally sat down with his back against

the wall of the building opposite. Inside of ten minutes he was sound

asleep and snoring gently.
I wanted nothing better than that. The descent was a little difficult to

accomplish noiselessly, as I had to drop some feet, but I managed it.

After crouching for a moment to see if the slight sounds had aroused

him, I crept along the wall to where he sat. The stone pestle of the

metate I had been forced to leave behind me, but I had the heavy

barrel of my gun, and I was going to take no chances. I had no

compunctions as to what I did to any one of this pack of mad dogs.

Cautiously I drew it from its holster and poised it to strike. At that

instant I was seized and pinioned from behind.

[Pg 76]
CHAPTER XI
I did not struggle. I would have done so if I had been able, but I was

caught in a grip so skillful that the smallest move gave me the most

exquisite pain. At that time I had not even heard the words jiu jitsu,

but I have looked them up since. Cortinez, the sleepy sentry, without

changing his position, had opened his eyes and was grinning at me.
I was forced to my feet and marched to the open door of the corner room.

There I was released, and turned around to face Hooper himself. The old

man's face was twisted in a sardonic half-snarl that might pass for a

grin; but there was no smile in his unblinking wildcat eyes. There

seemed to be trace neither of the girl nor the girl's occupation.
"Thank you for your warning of your intended visit," said Hooper in

silky tones, indicating my bandana which lay on the table. "And now may

I inquire to what I owe the honour of this call? Or it may be that the

visit was not intended for me at all. Mistake in the rooms, perhaps. I

often shift and change my quarters, and those of my household;

especially if I suspect I have some reason for doing so. It adds

interest to an otherwise uneventful life."
He was eying me sardonically, evidently gloating over the situation as

he found it.
"How did you get on that roof? Who let you inside the walls?" he

demanded, abruptly.
[Pg 77]I merely smiled at him.
"That we can determine later," he observed, resuming command of himself.
I measured my chances, and found them at present a minus quantity. The

old man was separated from me by a table, and he held my own revolver

ready for instant use. So I stood tight and waited.
The room was an almost exact replica of the one in which I had spent the

night so short a time before; the same long narrow transom near the

ceiling, the same barred windows opening on the court, the same closet

against the blank wall. Hooper had evidently inhabited it for some days,

for it was filled with his personal belongings. Indeed he must have

moved in en bloc when his ward had been moved out, for none of the

furnishings showed the feminine touch, and several articles could have

belonged only to the old man personally. Of such was a small iron safe

in one corner and a tall old-fashioned desk crammed with papers.
But if I decided overt action unwise at this moment, I decidedly went

into action the next. Hooper whistled and four Mexicans appeared with

ropes. Somehow I knew if they once hog-tied me I would never get another

chance. Better dead now than helpless in the morning, for what that old

buzzard might want of me.
One of them tossed a loop at me. I struck it aside and sailed in.
It had always been my profound and contemptuous belief that I could lick

any four Mexicans. Now I had to take that back. I could not. But I gave

the man argument, and by the time they had my elbows lashed behind me

and [Pg 78]my legs tied to the legs of one of those big solid chairs they like

to name as "Mission style," I had marked them up and torn their pretty

clothes and smashed a lot of junk around the place and generally got

them so mad they would have knifed me in a holy second if it had not

been for Old Man Hooper. The latter held up the lamp where it wouldn't

get smashed and admonished them in no uncertain terms that he wanted me

alive and comparatively undamaged. Oh, sure! they mussed me up, too. I

wasn't very pretty, either.
The bravos withdrew muttering curses, as the story books say; and after

Hooper had righted the table and stuck the lamp on it, and taken a good

look at my bonds, he withdrew also.
Most of my time until the next thing occurred was occupied in figuring

on all the things that might happen to me. One thing I acknowledged to

myself right off the reel: the Mexicans had sure trussed me up for

further orders! I could move my hands, but I knew enough of ropes and

ties to realize that my chances of getting free were exactly nothing. My

plans had gone perfectly up to this moment. I had schemed to get inside

the ranch and into Old Man Hooper's room; and here I was! What more

could a man ask?
The next thing occurred so soon, however, that I hadn't had time to

think of more than ten per cent. of the things that might happen to me.

The outside door opened to admit Hooper, followed by the girl. He stood

aside in the most courtly fashion.
"My dear," he said, "here is Mr. Sanborn, who has come [Pg 79]to call on you.

You remember Mr. Sanborn, I am sure. You met him at dinner; and besides,

I believe you had some correspondence with him, did you not? He has

taken so much trouble, so very much trouble to see you that I think it a

great pity his wish should not be fulfilled. Won't you sit down here, my

dear?"
She was staring at me, her eyes gone wide with wonder and horror. Half

thinking she took her seat as indicated. Instantly the old man had bound

her elbows at the back and had lashed her to the chair. After the first

start of surprise she made no resistance.
"There," said Hooper, straightening up after the accomplishment of this

task; "now I'm going to leave you to your visit. You can talk it all

over. Tell him all you please, my dear. And you, sir, tell her all you

know. I think I can arrange so your confidences will go no further."
For the first time I heard him laugh, a high, uncertain cackle. The girl

said nothing, but she stared at him with level, blazing eyes. Also for

the first time I began to take an interest in her.
"Do you object to smoking?" I asked her, suddenly.
She blinked and recovered.
"Not at all," she answered.
"Well then, old man, be a sport. Give me the makings. I can get my hands

to my mouth."
The old man transferred his baleful eyes on me. Then without saying a

word he placed in my hands a box of tailor-made cigarettes and a dozen

matches.
"Until morning," he observed, his hand on the door knob. He inclined in

a most courteous fashion, first to the one of [Pg 80]us, then to the other,

and went out. He did not lock the door after him, and I could hear him

addressing Cortinez outside. The girl started to speak, but I waved my

shackled hand at her for silence. By straining my ears I could just make

out what was said.
"I am going to bed," Hooper said. "It is not necessary to stand guard.

You may get your blankets and sleep on the verandah."
After the old man's footsteps had died, I turned back to the girl

opposite me and looked her over carefully. My first impression of

meekness I revised. She did not look to be one bit meek. Her lips were

compressed, her nostrils wide, her level eyes unsubdued. A person of

sense, I said to myself, well balanced, who has learned when it is

useless to kick against the pricks, but who has not necessarily on that

account forever renounced all kicking. It occurred to me that she must

have had to be pretty thoroughly convinced before she had come to this

frame of mind. When she saw that I had heard all I wanted of the

movements outside, she spoke hurriedly in her low, sweet voice:
"Oh, I am so distressed! This is all my doing! I should have known

better——"
"Now," I interrupted her, decisively, "let's get down to cases. You had

nothing to do with this; nothing whatever. I visited this ranch the

first time out of curiosity, and to-night because I knew that I'd have

to hit first to save my own life. You had no influence on me in either

case."
"You thought this was my room—I wrote you it was," she countered,

swiftly.
"I wanted to see you solely and simply that I might find [Pg 81]out how to get

at Hooper. This is all my fault; and we're going to cut out the

self-accusations and get down to cases."
I afterward realized that all this was somewhat inconsiderate and

ungallant and slightly humiliating; I should have taken the part of the

knight-errant rescuing the damsel in distress, but at that moment only

the direct essentials entered my mind.
"Very well," she assented in her repressed tones.
"Do you think he is listening to what we say; or has somebody

listening?"
"I am positive not."
"Why?"
"I lived in this room for two months, and I know every inch of it."
"He might have some sort of a concealed listening hole somewhere, just

the same."
"I am certain he has not. The walls are two feet thick."
"All right; let it go at that. Now let's see where we stand. In the

first place, how do you dope this out?"
"What do you mean?"
"What does he intend to do with us?"
She looked at me straight, eye to eye.
"In the morning he will kill you—unless you can contrive something."
"Cheering thought."
"There is no sense in not facing situations squarely. If there is a way

out, that is the only method by which it may be found."
"True," I agreed, my admiration growing. "And yourself; will he kill

you, too?"
[Pg 82]"He will not. He does not dare!" she cried, proudly, with a flash of

the eyes.
I was not so sure of that, but there was no object in saying so.
"Why has he tied you in that chair, then, along with the condemned?" I

asked.
"You will understand better if I tell you who I am."
"You are his deceased partner's daughter; and everybody thinks you are

in Europe," I stated.
"How in the world did you know that? But no matter; it is true. I

embarked three months ago on the Limited for New York intending, as you

say, to go on a long trip to Europe. My father and I had been alone in

the world. We were very fond of each other. I took no companion, nor did

I intend to. I felt quite independent and able to take care of myself.

At the last moment Mr. Hooper boarded the train. That was quite

unexpected. He was on his way to the ranch. He persuaded me to stop over

for a few days to decide some matters. You know, since my father's death

I am half owner."
"Whole owner," I murmured.
"What did you say?"
"Nothing. Go ahead. Sure you don't mind my smoking?" I lit one of the

tailor-mades and settled back. Even my inexperienced youth recognized

the necessity of relief this long-continued stubborn repression must

feel. My companion had as yet told me nothing I did not already know or

guess; but I knew it would do her good to talk, and I might learn

something valuable.
"We came out to the ranch, and talked matters over [Pg 83]quite normally; but

when it came time for my departure, I was not permitted to leave. For

some unexplained reason I was a prisoner, confined absolutely to the

four walls of this enclosure. I was guarded night and day; and I soon

found I was to be permitted conversation with two men only, Mexicans

named Ramon and Andreas."
"They are his right and left hand," I commented.
"So I found. You may imagine I did not submit to this until I found I

had to. Then I made up my mind that the only possible thing to do was to

acquiesce, to observe, and to wait my chance."
"You were right enough there. Why do you figure he did this?"
"I don't know!" she cried with a flash of thwarted despair. "I have

racked my brains, but I can find no motive. He has not asked me for a

thing; he has not even asked me a question. Unless he's stark crazy, I

cannot make it out!"
"He may be that," I suggested.
"He may be; and yet I doubt it somehow. I don't know why; but I feel

that he is sane enough. He is inconceivably cruel and domineering. He

will not tolerate a living thing about the place that will not or cannot

take orders from him. He kills the flies, the bees, the birds, the

frogs, because they are not his. I believe he would kill a man as

quickly who stood out even for a second against him here. To that extent

I believe he is crazy: a sort of monomania. But not otherwise. That is

why I say he will kill you; I really believe he would do it."
"So do I," I agreed, grimly. "However, let's drop that [Pg 84]for right now.

Do you know a man named Brower, Artie Brower?"
"I don't think I ever heard of him. Why?"
"Never mind for a minute. I've just had a great thought strike me. Just

let me alone a few moments while I work it out."
I lighted a second cigarette from the butt of the first and fell into a

study. Cortinez breathed heavily outside. Otherwise the silence was as

dead as the blackness of the night. The smoke from my cigarettes floated

lazily until it reached the influence of the hot air from the lamp; then

it shot upward toward the ceiling. The girl watched me from under her

level brows, always with that air of controlled restraint I found so

admirable.
"I've got it," I said at last, "—or at least I think I have. Now listen

to me, and believe what I've got to say. Here are the facts: first, your

father and Hooper split partnership a while back. Hooper took his share

entirely in cash; your father took his probably part in cash, but

certainly all of the ranch and cattle. Get that clear? Hooper owns no

part of the ranch and cattle. All right. Your father dies before the

papers relating to this agreement are recorded. Nobody knew of those

papers except your father and Hooper. So if Hooper were to destroy those

papers, he'd still have the cash that had been paid him, and an equal

share in the property. That plain?"
"Perfectly," she replied, composedly. "Why didn't he destroy them?"
"Because they had been stolen by this man Brower I asked you about—an

ex-jockey of Hooper's. Brower held [Pg 85]them for blackmail. Unless Hooper

came through Brower would record the papers."
"Where do I come in?"
"Easy. I'm coming to that. But answer me this: who would be your heir in

case you died?"
"Why—I don't know!"
"Have you any kin?"
"Not a soul!"
"Did you ever make a will?"
"I never thought of such a thing!"
"Well, I'll tell you. If you were to die your interest in this property

would go to Hooper."
"What makes you think so? I thought it would go to the state."
"I'm guessing," I acknowledged, "but I believe I'm guessing straight. A

lot of these old Arizona partnerships were made just that way. Life was

uncertain out here. I'll bet the old original partnership between your

father and Hooper provides that in case of the extinction of one line,

the other will inherit. It's a very common form of partnership in a new

country like this. You can see for yourself it's a sensible thing to

provide."
"You may be right," she commented. "Go on."
"You told me a while ago it was best to face any situation squarely. Now

brace up and face this. You said a while ago that Hooper would not dare

kill you. That is true for the moment. But there is no doubt in my mind

that he has intended from the first to kill you, because by that he

would get possession of the whole property."
"I cannot believe it!" she cried.
[Pg 86]"Isn't the incentive enough? Think carefully, and answer honestly:

don't you think him capable of it?"
"Yes—I suppose so," she admitted, reluctantly, after a moment. She

gathered herself as after a shock. "Why hasn't he done so? Why has he

waited?"
I told her of the situation as it concerned Brower. While the

dissolution of partnership papers still existed and might still be

recorded, such a murder would be useless. For naturally the dissolution

abrogated the old partnership agreement. The girl's share of the

property would, at her demise intestate, go to the state. That is,

provided the new papers were ever recorded.
"Then I am safe until——?" she began.
"Until he negotiates or otherwise settles with Brower. Until he has

destroyed all evidence."
"Then everything seems to depend on this Brower," she said, knitting her

brows anxiously. "Where is he?"
I did not answer this last question. My eyes were riveted on the door

knob which was slowly, almost imperceptibly, turning. Cortinez continued

to breathe heavily in sleep outside. The intruder was evidently at great

pains not to awaken the guard. A fraction of an inch at a time the door

opened. A wild-haired, wild-eyed head inserted itself cautiously through

the crack. The girl's eyes widened in surprise and, I imagine, a little

in fear. I began to laugh, silently, so as not to disturb Cortinez.

Mirth overcame me; the tears ran down my cheeks.
"It's so darn complete!" I gasped, answering the girl's horrified look

of inquiry. "Miss Emory, allow me to present Mr. Artie Brower!"

[Pg 87]
CHAPTER XII
Brower entered the room quickly but very quietly, and at once came to

me. His eyes were staring, his eyelids twitched, his hands shook. I

recognized the symptoms.
"Have you got it? Have you got it with you?" he whispered, feverishly.
"It's all right. I can fix you up. Untie me first," I replied.
He began to fumble with the knots of my bonds too hastily and

impatiently for effectiveness. I was trying to stoop over far enough to

see what he was doing when my eye caught the shadow of a moving figure

outside. An instant later Tim Westmore, the English groom attached to

the Morgan stallion, came cautiously through the door, which he closed

behind him. I attempted unobtrusively to warn Brower, but he only looked

up, nodded vaguely, and continued his fumbling efforts to free me.

Westmore glanced at us all curiously, but went at once to the big

windows, which he proceeded to swing shut. Then he came over to us,

pushed Brower one side, and most expeditiously untied the knots. I stood

up stretching in the luxury of freedom, then turned to perform a like

office for Miss Emory. But Brower was by now frantic. He seized my arm

and fairly shook me, big as I was, in the urgence of his desire. He was

rapidly losing all control and caution.
[Pg 88]"Let him have it, sir," urged Westmore in a whisper. "I'll free the

young lady."
I gave Brower the hypodermic case. He ran to the wash bowl for water.

During the process of preparation he uttered little animal sounds under

his breath. When the needle had sunk home he lay back in a chair and

closed his eyes.
In the meantime, I had been holding a whispered colloquy with Westmore.
"He sneaked in on me at dark, sir," he told me, "on foot. I don't know

how he got in without being seen. They'd have found his tracks anyway in

the morning. I don't think he knew quite what he wanted to do. Him and

me were old pals, and he wanted to ask me about things. He didn't expect

to stay, I fancy. He told me he had left his horse tied a mile or so

down the road. Then a while back orders came to close down, air tight.

We're used to such orders. Nobody can go out or come in, you understand.

And there are guards placed. That made him uneasy. He told me then he

was a hop fiend. I've seen them before, and I got uneasy, too. If he

came to the worst I might have to tie and gag him. I know how they are."
"Go ahead," I urged. He had stopped to listen.
"I don't like that Cortinez being so handy like out there," he

confessed.
"Hooper told him he could sleep. He's not likely to pay attention to us.

Miss Emory and I have been talking aloud."
"I hope not. Well, then, Ramon came by and stopped to talk to me for a

minute. I had to hide Artie in a box-stall and hope to God he kept

quiet. He wasn't as bad as he is [Pg 89]now. Ramon told me about you being

caught, and went on. After that nothing must do but find you. He thought

you might have his dope. He'd have gone into the jaws of hell after it.

So I came along to keep him out of mischief."
"What are you going to do now?" asked the girl, who had kicked off her

slippers and had been walking a few paces to and fro.
"I don't know, ma'am. We've got to get away."
"We?"
"You mean me, too? Yes, ma'am! I have stood with the doings of this

place as long as I can stand them. Artie has told me some other things.

Are you here of your free will, ma'am?" he asked, abruptly.
"No," she replied.
"I suspected as much. I'm through with the whole lot of them."
Brower opened his eyes. He was now quite calm.
"Hooper sold the Morgan stallion," he whispered, smiled sardonically,

and closed his eyes again.
"Without telling me a word of it!" added Tim with heat. "He ain't

delivered him yet."
"Well, I don't blame you. Now you'd better quietly sneak back to your

quarters. There is likely to be trouble before we get through. You, too,

Brower. Nobody knows you are here."
Brower opened his eyes again.
"I can get out of this place now I've had me hop," said he, decidedly.

"Come on, let's go."
"We'll all go," I agreed; "but let's see what we can find here first.

There may be some paper—or something——"
[Pg 90]"What do you mean? What sort of papers? Hadn't we better go at once?"
"It is supposed to be well known that the reason Hooper isn't

assassinated from behind a bush is because in that case his killers are

in turn to assassinate a long list of his enemies. Only nobody is sure:

just as nobody is really sure that he has killers at all. You can't get

action on an uncertainty."
She nodded. "I can understand that."
"If we could get proof positive it would be no trick at all to raise the

country."
"What sort of proof?"
"Well, I mentioned a list. I don't doubt his head man—Ramon, I suppose,

the one he'd trust with carrying out such a job—must have a list of

some sort. He wouldn't trust to memory."
"And he wouldn't trust it to Ramon until after he was dead!" said the

girl with sudden intuition. "If it exists we'll find it here."
She started toward the paper-stuffed desk, but I stopped her.
"More likely the safe," said I.
Tim, who was standing near it, tried the handle.
"It's locked," he whispered.
I fell on my knees and began to fiddle with the dial, of course in vain.

Miss Emory, with more practical decision of character, began to run

through the innumerable bundles and loose papers in the desk, tossing

them aside as they proved unimportant or not germane to the issue. I had

not the slightest knowledge of the constructions of safes [Pg 91]but whirled

the knob hopelessly in one direction or another trying to listen for

clicks, as somewhere I had read was the thing to do. As may be imagined,

I arrived nowhere. Nor did the girl. We looked at each other in chagrin

at last.
"There is nothing here but ranch bills and accounts and business

letters," she confessed.
I merely shook my head.
At this moment Brower, whom I had supposed to be sound asleep, opened

his eyes.
"Want that safe open?" he asked, drowsily.
He arose, stretched, and took his place beside me on the floor. His head

cocked one side, he slowly turned the dials with the tips of fingers I

for the first time noticed were long and slim and sensitive. Twice after

extended, delicate manipulations he whirled the knob impatiently and

took a fresh start. On the proverbial third trial he turned the handle

and the door swung open. He arose rather stiffly from his knees, resumed

his place in the armchair, and again closed his eyes.
It was a small safe, with few pigeon holes. A number of blue-covered

contracts took small time for examination. There were the usual number

of mine certificates not valuable enough for a safe deposit, some

confidential memoranda and accounts having to do with the ranch.
"Ah, here is something!" I breathed to the eager audience over my

shoulder. I held in my hands a heavy manila envelope, sealed, inscribed

"Ramon. (To be destroyed unopened.)"
"Evidently we were right: Ramon has the combination and is to be

executor," I commented.
[Pg 92]I tore open the envelope and extracted from it another of the

blue-covered documents.
"It's a copy, unsigned, of that last agreement with your father," I

said, after a disappointed glance. "It's worth keeping," and I thrust it

inside my shirt.
But this particular pigeon hole proved to be a mine. In it were several

more of the same sort of envelope, all sealed, all addressed to Ramon.

One was labelled as the Last Will, one as Inventory, and one simply as

Directions. This last had a further warning that it was to be opened

only by the one addressed. I determined by hasty examination that the

first two were only what they purported to be, and turned hopefully to a

perusal of the last. It was in Spanish, and dealt at great length with

the disposition and management of Hooper's extensive interests. I append

a translation of the portion of this remarkable document, having to do

with our case.
"These are my directions," it began, "as to the matter of which we have

many times spoken together. I have many enemies, and many who think they

have cause to wish my death. They are cowards and soft and I do not

think they will ever be sure enough to do me harm. I do not fear them.

But it may be that one or some of them will find it in their souls to do

a deed against me. In that case I shall be content, for neither do I

fear the devil. But I shall be content only if you follow my orders. I

add here a list of my enemies and of those who have cause to wish me

ill. If I am killed, it is probable that some one of these will have

done the deed. Therefore they must all die. You must see to it,

following them if necessary to the [Pg 93]ends of the earth. You will know

how; and what means to employ. When all these are gone, then go you to

the highest rock on the southerly pinnacle of Cochise's Stronghold. Ten

paces northwest is a gray, flat slab. If you lift this slab there will

be found a copper box. In the box is the name of a man. You will go to

this man and give him the copper box and in return he will give to you

one hundred thousand dollars. I know well, my Ramon, that your honesty

would not permit you to seek the copper box before the last of my

enemies is dead. Nevertheless, that you may admire my recourse, I have

made an arrangement. If the gray slab on Cochise's Stronghold is ever

disturbed before the whole toll is paid, you will die very suddenly and

unpleasantly. I know well that you, my Ramon, would not disturb it; and

I hope for your sake that nobody else will do so. It is not likely. No

one is fool enough to climb Cochise's Stronghold for pleasure; and this

gray slab is one among many."
At this time I did not read carefully the above cheerful document. My

Spanish was good enough, but took time in the translating. I dipped into

it enough to determine that it was what we wanted, and flipped the pages

to come to the list of prospective victims. It covered two sheets, and a

glance down the columns showed me that about every permanent inhabitant

of the Soda Springs Valley was included. I found my own name in quite

fresh ink toward the last.
"This is what we want," I said in satisfaction, rising to my feet. I

sketched in a few words the purport of the document.
"Let me see it," said the girl.
I handed it to her. She began to examine carefully the [Pg 94]list of names,

her face turning paler as she read. Tim Westmore looked anxiously over

her shoulder. Suddenly I saw his face congest and his eyes bulge.
"Why! why!" he gasped, "I'm there! What've I ever done, I ask you that?

The old——" he choked, at a loss and groping. Then his anger flared up.

"I've always served him faithful and done what I was told," he muttered,

fiercely. "I'll do him in for this!"
"I am here," observed Miss Emory.
"Yes, and that sot in the chair!" whispered Tim, fiercely.
Again Brower proved he was not asleep by opening one eye.
"Thanks for them kind words," said he.
"We've got to get out of here," stated Tim with conviction.
"That idea just got through your thick British skull?" queried Artie,

rousing again.
"I wish we had some way to carry the young lady—she can't walk," said

Westmore, paying no attention.
"I have my horse tied out by the lone Joshua-tree," I answered him.
"I'm going to take a look at that Cortinez," said the little Englishman,

nodding his satisfaction at my news as to the horse. "I'm not easy about

him."
"He'll sleep like a log until morning," Miss Emory reassured me. "I've

often stepped right over him where he has been on guard and walked all

around the garden."
"Just the same I'm going to take a look," persisted Westmore.
He tiptoed to the door, softly turned the knob and opened it. He found

himself face to face with Cortinez.

[Pg 95]
CHAPTER XIII
I had not thought of the English groom as a man of resource, but his

action in this emergency proved him. He cast a fleeting glance over his

shoulder. Artie Brower was huddled down in his armchair practically out

of sight; Miss Emory and I had reseated ourselves in the only other two

chairs in the room, so that we were in the same relative positions as

when we had been bound and left. Only the confusion of the papers on the

floor and the open safe would have struck an observant eye.
"It is well that you come," said Tim to Cortinez in Spanish. "The señor

sent me to conduct these two to the East Room and I like not the job

alone. Enter."
He held the door with one hand and fairly dragged Cortinez through with

the other. Instantly he closed the door and cast himself on Cortinez's

back. I had already launched myself at the Mexican's throat.
The struggle was violent but brief. Fortunately I had not missed my

spring at our enemy's windpipe, so he had been unable to shout. The

noise of our scuffle sounded loud enough within the walls of the room;

but those walls were two feet thick, and the door and windows closed.
"Get something to gag him with, and the cords," panted Tim to the girl.
Brower opened his eyes again.
[Pg 96]"I can beat that," he announced.
He produced his hypodermic and proceeded to mix a gunful of the dope.
"This'll fix him," he observed, turning back the Mexican's sleeve. "You

can lay him outside and if anybody comes along they'll think he's

asleep—as usual."
This we did when the dope had worked.
It was now high time to think of our next move. For weapons we had the

gun and knife taken from Cortinez and the miserable little automatic

belonging to Brower. That was all. It was perfectly evident that we

could not get out through the regular doorways, as, by Tim's statement,

they were all closed and guarded. On my representation it was decided to

try the roof.
We therefore knotted together the cord that had bound me and two sheets

from the bed, and sneaked cautiously out on the verandah, around the

corner to the water barrel, and so to the vantage point of the roof.
The chill of the night was come, and the stars hung cold in the sky. It

seemed that the air would snap and crackle were some little resolving

element to be dropped into its suspended hush. Not a sound was to be

heard except a slow drip of water from somewhere in the courtyard.
It was agreed that I, as the heaviest, should descend first. I landed

easily enough and steadied the rope for Miss Emory who came next. While

I was waiting I distinctly heard, from the direction of the willows, the

hooting of an owl. Furthermore, it was a great horned owl, and he seemed

to have a lot to say. You remember what I told you about setting your

mind so that only one sort of noise will arouse [Pg 97]it, but that one

instantly? I knew perfectly well that Old Man Hooper's mind was set to

all these smaller harmless noises that most people never notice at all,

waking or sleeping—frogs, crickets, owls. And therefore I was convinced

that sooner or later that old man and his foolish ideas and his shotgun

would come projecting right across our well-planned getaway. Which was

just what happened, and almost at once. Probably that great horned owl

had been hooting for some time, but we had been too busy to notice. I

heard the wicket door turning on its hinges, and ventured a warning hiss

to Brower and Tim Westmore, who had not yet descended. An instant later

I could make out shadowy forms stealing toward the willows. Evidently

those who served Old Man Hooper were accustomed to broken rest.
We kept very quiet, straining our eyes at the willows. After an interval

a long stab of light pierced the dusk and the round detonation of

old-fashioned black powder shook the silence. There came to us the

babbling of voices released. At the same instant the newly risen moon

plastered us against that whitewashed wall like insects pinned in a

cork-lined case. The moonlight must have been visibly creeping down to

us for some few minutes, but so absorbed had I been in the doings of the

party in the willows, and so chuckleheaded were the two on the roof,

that actually none of us had noticed!
I dropped flat and dragged the girl down with me. But there remained

that ridiculous, plainly visible rope; and anyway a shout relieved me of

any doubt as to whether we had been seen. Brower came tumbling down on

us, and with [Pg 98]one accord we three doubled to the right around the walls

of the ranch. A revolver shot sang by us, but we were not immediately

pursued. Our antagonists were too few and too uncertain of our numbers

and arms.
It was up to us to utilize the few minutes before the ranch should be

aroused. We doubled back through the willows and across the mesquite

flat toward the lone Joshua-tree where I had left my horse. I held the

girl's hand to help her when she stumbled, while Brower scuttled along

with surprising endurance for a dope wreck. Nobody said anything, but

saved their wind.
"Where's Tim?" I asked at a check when we had to scramble across a

barranca.
"He went back into the ranch the way we came," replied Artie with some

bitterness.
It was, nevertheless, the wisest thing he could have done. He had not

been identified with this outfit except by Cortinez, and Cortinez was

safe for twelve hours.
We found the Joshua-tree without difficulty.
"Now," said I, "here is the plan. You are to take these papers to Señor

Buck Johnson, at the Box Springs ranch. That's the next ranch on the

fork of the road. Do you remember it?"
"Yes," said Brower, who had waked up and seemed quite sober and

responsible. "I can get to it."
"Wake him up. Show him these papers. Make him read them. Tell him that

Miss Emory and I are in the Bat-eye Tunnel. Remember that?"
"The Bat-eye Tunnel," repeated Artie.
"Why don't you go?" inquired the girl, anxiously.
[Pg 99]"I ride too heavy; and I know where the tunnel is," I replied. "If

anybody else was to go, it would be you. But Artie rides light and sure,

and he'll have to ride like hell. Here, put these papers inside your

shirt. Be off!"
Lights were flickering at the ranch as men ran to and fro with lanterns.

It would not take these skilled vaqueros long to catch their horses

and saddle up. At any moment I expected to see the massive doors swing

open to let loose the wolf pack.
Brower ran to my horse—a fool proceeding, especially for an experienced

horseman—and jerked loose the tie rope. Badger is a good reliable cow

horse, but he's not a million years old, and he's got some natural

equine suspicions. I kind of lay a good deal of it to that fool

hard-boiled hat. At any rate, he snorted and sagged back on the rope,

hit a yucca point, whirled and made off. Artie was game. He hung on

until he was drug into a bunch of chollas, and then he had to let go.

Badger departed into the distance, tail up and snorting.
"Well, you've done it now!" I observed to Brower, who, crying with

nervous rage and chagrin, and undoubtedly considerably stuck up with

cholla spines, was crawling to his feet.
"Can't we catch him? Won't he stop?" asked Miss Emory. "If he gets to

the ranch, won't they look for you?"
"He's one of my range ponies: he won't stop short of the Gila."
I cast over the chances in my mind, weighing my knowledge of the country

against the probabilities of search. The proportion was small. Most of

my riding experience [Pg 100]had been farther north and to the west. Such

obvious hole-ups as the one I had suggested—the Bat-eye Tunnel—were of

course familiar to our pursuers. My indecision must have seemed long,

for the girl broke in anxiously on my meditations.
"Oughtn't we to be moving?"
"As well here as anywhere," I replied. "We are under good cover; and

afoot we could not much better ourselves as against mounted men. We must

hide."
"But they may find the trampled ground where your horse has been tied."
"I hope they do."
"You hope they do!"
"Sure. They'll figure that we must sure have moved away. They'll never

guess we'd hide near at hand. At least that's what I hope."
"How about tracks?"
"Not at night. By daylight maybe."
"But then to-morrow morning they can——"
"To-morrow morning is a long way off."
"Look!" cried Brower.
The big gates of the ranch had been thrown open. The glare of a

light—probably a locomotive headlight—poured out. Mounted figures

galloped forth and swerved to right or left, spreading in a circle about

the enclosure. The horsemen reined to a trot and began methodically to

quarter the ground, weaving back and forth. Four detached themselves and

rode off at a swift gallop to the points of the compass. The mounted men

were working fast for fear, I suppose, that we may have possessed

horses. Another contingent, [Pg 101]afoot and with lanterns, followed more

slowly, going over the ground for indications. I could not but admire

the skill and thoroughness of the plan.
"Our only chance is in the shadow from the moon," I told my companions.

"If we can slip through the riders, and get in their rear, we may be

able to follow the barranca down. Any of those big rocks will do. Lay

low, and after a rider has gone over a spot, try to get to that spot

without being seen."
We were not to be kept long in suspense. Out of all the three hundred

and sixty degrees of the circle one of the swift outriders selected

precisely our direction! Straight as an arrow he came for us, at full

gallop. I could see the toss of his horse's mane against the light from

the opened door. There was no time to move. All we could do was to cower

beneath our rock, muscles tense, and hope to be able to glide around the

shadow as he passed.
But he did not pass. Down into the shallow barranca he slid with a

tinkle of shale, and drew rein within ten feet of our lurking place.
We could hear the soft snorting of his mount above the thumping of our

hearts. I managed to get into a position to steal a glimpse. It was

difficult, but at length I made out the statuesque lines of the horse,

and the rider himself, standing in his stirrups and leaning slightly

forward, peering intently about him. The figures were in silhouette

against the sky, but nobody ever fooled me as to a horse. It was the

Morgan stallion, and the rider was Tim Westmore. Just as the realization

came to me, Tim uttered a low, impatient whistle.
[Pg 102]It's always a good idea to take a chance. I arose into view—but I kept

my gun handy.
"Thank God!" cried Tim, fervently, under his breath. "I remembered you'd

left your horse by this Joshua: it's the only landmark in the dark.

Saints!" he ejaculated in dismay as he saw us all. "Where's your horse?"
"Gone."
"We can't all ride this stallion——"
"Listen," I cut in, and I gave him the same directions I had previously

given Brower. He heard me attentively.
"I can beat that," he cut me off. He dismounted. "Get on here, Artie.

Ride down the barranca two hundred yards and you'll come to an alkali

flat. Get out on that flat and ride like hell for Box Springs."
"Why don't you do it?"
"I'm going back and tell 'em how I was slugged and robbed of my horse."
"They'll kill you if they suspect; dare you go back?"
"I've been back once," he pointed out. He was helping Brower aboard.
"Where did you get that bag?" he asked.
"Found it by the rock where we were hiding: it's mine," replied Brower.
Westmore tried to get him to leave it, but the little jockey was

obstinate. He kicked his horse and, bending low, rode away.
"You're right: I beg your pardon," I answered Westmore's remark to me.

"You don't look slugged."
"That's easy fixed," said Tim, calmly. He removed his hat and hit his

forehead a very solid blow against a projection [Pg 103]of the conglomerate

boulder. The girl screamed slightly.
"Hush!" warned Tim in a fierce whisper. He raised his hand toward the

approaching horsemen, who were now very near. Without attention to the

blood streaming from his brow he bent his head to listen to the faint

clinking of steel against rock that marked the stallion's progress

toward the alkali flat. The searchers were by now dangerously close, and

Tim uttered a smothered oath of impatience. But at last we distinctly

heard the faint, soft thud of galloping hoofs.
The searchers heard it, too, and reined up to listen. Tim thrust into my

hand the 30-30 Winchester he was carrying together with a box of

cartridges. Then with a leap like a tiger he gained the rim of the

barranca. Once there, however, his forces seemed to desert him. He

staggered forward calling in a weak voice. I could hear the volley of

rapid questions shot at him by the men who immediately surrounded him;

and his replies. Then somebody fired a revolver thrice in rapid

succession and the whole cavalcade swept away with a mighty crackling of

brush. Immediately after Tim rejoined us. I had not expected this.
Relieved for the moment we hurried Miss Emory rapidly up the bed of the

shallow wash. The tunnel mentioned was part of an old mine operation,

undertaken at some remote period before the cattle days. It entered the

base of one of those isolated conical hills, lying like islands in the

plain, so common in Arizona. From where we had hidden it lay about three

miles to the northeast. It was a natural and [Pg 104]obvious hide out, and I

had no expectation of remaining unmolested. My hope lay in rescue.
We picked our way under cover of the ravine as long as we could, then

struck boldly across the plain. Nobody seemed to be following us. A wild

hope entered my heart that perhaps they might believe we had all made

our escape to Box Springs.
As we proceeded the conviction was borne in on me that the stratagem had

at least saved us from immediate capture. Like most men who ride I had

very sketchy ideas of what three miles afoot is like—at night—in high

heels. The latter affliction was common to both Miss Emory and myself.

She had on a sort of bedroom slipper, and I wore the usual cowboy boots.

We began to go footsore about the same time, and the little rolling

volcanic rocks among the bunches of sacatone did not help us a bit.

Tim made good time, curse him. Or rather, bless him; for as I just said,

if he had not tolled away our mounted pursuit we would have been caught

as sure as God made little green apples. He seemed as lively as a

cricket, in spite of the dried blood across his face.
The moon was now sailing well above the horizon, throwing the world into

silver and black velvet. When we moved in the open we showed up like a

train of cars; but, on the other hand, the shadow was a cloak. It was by

now nearly one o'clock in the morning.
Miss Emory's nerve did not belie the clear, steadfast look of her eye;

but she was about all in when we reached the foot of Bat-eye Butte. Tim

and I had discussed the procedure as we walked. I was for lying in wait

outside; but Tim pointed out that the tunnel entrance was well down in

[Pg 105]the boulders, that even the sharpest outlook could not be sure of

detecting an approach through the shadows, and that from the shelter of

the roof props and against the light we should be able to hold off a

large force almost indefinitely. In any case, we would have to gamble on

Brewer's winning through, and having sense enough in his opium-saturated

mind to make a convincing yarn of it. So after a drink at the tenaja

below the mine we entered the black square of the tunnel.
The work was old, but it had been well done. They must have dragged the

timbers down from the White Mountains. Indeed a number of unused beams,

both trunks of trees and squared, still lay around outside. From time to

time, since the original operations, some locoed prospector comes

projecting along and does a little work in hopes he may find something

the other fellow had missed. So the passage was crazy with props and

supports, new and old, placed to brace the ageing overhead timbers.

Going in they were a confounded nuisance against the bumped head; but

looking back toward the square of light they made fine protections

behind which to crouch. In this part of the country any tunnel would be

dry. It ran straight for about a hundred and fifty feet.
We groped our way about seventy-five feet, which was as far as we could

make out the opening distinctly, and sat down to wait. I still had the

rest of the tailor-made cigarettes, which I shared with Tim. We did not

talk, for we wished to listen for sounds outside. To judge by her

breathing, I think Miss Emory dozed, or even went to sleep.
[Pg 106]About an hour later I thought to hear a single tinkle of shale. Tim

heard it, too, for he nudged me. Our straining ears caught nothing

further, however; and I, for one, had relaxed from my tension when the

square of light was darkened by a figure. I was nearest, so I raised

Cortinez's gun and fired. The girl uttered a scream, and the figure

disappeared. I don't know yet whether I hit him or not; we never found

any blood.
We made Miss Emory lie down behind a little slide of rock, and disposed

ourselves under shelter.
"We can take them as fast as they come," exulted Tim.
"I don't believe there are more than two or three of them," I observed.

"It would be only a scouting party. They will go for help."
As there was no longer reason for concealment, we talked aloud and

freely.
Now ensued a long waiting interim. We could hear various sounds outside

as of moving to and fro. The enemy had likewise no reason for further

concealment.
"Look!" suddenly cried Tim. "Something crawling."
He raised the 30-30 and fired. Before the flash and the fumes had

blinded me I, too, had seen indistinctly something low and prone gliding

around the corner of the entrance. That was all we could make out of it,

for as you can imagine the light was almost non-existent. The thing

glided steadily, untouched or unmindful of the shots we threw at it.

When it came to the first of the crazy uprights supporting the roof

timbers it seemed to hesitate gropingly. Then it drew slowly back a foot

or so, and darted forward. [Pg 107]The ensuing thud enlightened us. The thing

was one of the long, squared timbers we had noted outside; and it was

being used as a battering ram.
"They'll bring the whole mountain down on us!" cried Tim, springing

forward.
But even as he spoke, and before he had moved two feet, that catastrophe

seemed at least to have begun. The prop gave way: the light at the

entrance was at once blotted out; the air was filled with terrifying

roaring echoes. There followed a succession of crashes, the rolling of

rocks over each other, the grinding slide of avalanches great and small.

We could scarcely breathe for the dust. Our danger was that now the

thing was started it would not stop: that the antique and inadequate

supports would all give way, one bringing down the other in succession

until we were buried. Would the forces of equilibrium establish

themselves through the successive slight resistances of these rotted,

worm-eaten old timbers before the constricted space in which we crouched

should be entirely eaten away?
After the first great crash there ensued a moment's hesitation. Then a

second span succumbed. There followed a series of minor chutes with

short intervening silences. At last so long an interval of calm ensued

that we plucked up courage to believe it all over. A single stone rolled

a few feet and hit the rock floor with a bang. Then, immediately after,

the first-deafening thunder was repeated as evidently another span gave

way. It sounded as though the whole mountain had moved. I was almost

afraid to stretch out my hand for fear it would encounter the wall of

débris. The roar ceased as abruptly as it had begun. Followed then a

[Pg 108]long silence. Then a little cascading tinkle of shale. And another dead

silence.
"I believe it's over," ventured Miss Emory, after a long time.
"I'm going to find out how bad it is," I asserted.
I moved forward cautiously, my arms extended before me, feeling my way

with my feet. Foot after foot I went, encountering nothing but the

props. Expecting as I did to meet an obstruction within a few paces at

most, I soon lost my sense of distance; after a few moments it seemed to

me that I must have gone much farther than the original length of the

tunnel. At last I stumbled over a fragment, and so found my fingers

against a rough mass of débris.
"Why, this is fine!" I cried to the others, "I don't believe more than a

span or so has gone!"
I struck one of my few remaining matches to make sure. While of course I

had no very accurate mental image of the original state of things, still

it seemed to me there was an awful lot of tunnel left. As the whole

significance of our situation came to me, I laughed aloud.
"Well," said I, cheerfully, "they couldn't have done us a better favour!

It's a half hour's job to dig us out, and in the meantime we are safe as

a covered bridge. We don't even have to keep watch."
"Provided Brower gets through," the girl reminded us.
"He'll get through," assented Tim, positively. "There's nothing on four

legs can catch that Morgan stallion."
I opened my watch crystal and felt of the hands. Half-past two.
[Pg 109]"Four or five hours before they can get here," I announced.
"We'd better go to sleep, I think," said Miss Emory.
"Good idea," I approved. "Just pick your rocks and go to it."
I sat down and leaned against one of the uprights, expecting fully to

wait with what patience I might the march of events. Sleep was the

farthest thing from my thoughts. When I came to I found myself doubled

on my side with a short piece of ore sticking in my ribs and eighteen or

twenty assorted cramp-pains in various parts of me. This was all my

consciousness had room to attend to for a few moments. Then I became

dully aware of faint tinkling sounds and muffled shoutings from the

outer end of the tunnel. I shouted in return and made my way as rapidly

as possible toward the late entrance.
A half hour later we crawled cautiously through a precarious opening and

stood blinking at the sunlight.

[Pg 110]
CHAPTER XIV
A group of about twenty men greeted our appearance with a wild cowboy

yell. Some of the men of our outfit were there, but not all; and I

recognized others from as far south as the Chiracahuas. Windy Bill was

there with Jed Parker; but Señor Johnson's bulky figure was nowhere to

be seen. The other men were all riders—nobody of any particular

standing or authority. The sun made it about three o'clock of the

afternoon. Our adventures had certainly brought us a good sleep!
After we had satisfied our thirst from a canteen we began to ask and

answer questions. Artie Brower had made the ranch without mishap, had

told his story, and had promptly fallen asleep. Buck Johnson, in his

usual deliberate manner, read all the papers through twice; pondered for

some time while the more excited Jed and Windy fidgeted impatiently; and

then, his mind made up, acted with his customary decision. Three men he

sent to reconnoitre in the direction of the Bat-eye Tunnel with

instructions to keep out of trouble and to report promptly. His other

riders he dispatched with an insistent summons to all the leading

cattlemen as far south as the Chiracahua Range, as far east as Grant's

Pass, as far west as Madrona. Such was Buck Johnson's reputation for

level-headedness that without hesitation these men saddled and rode at

their best [Pg 111]speed. By noon the weightiest of the Soda Spring Valley had

gathered in conclave.
"That's where we faded out," said Jed Parker. "They sent us up to see

about you-all. The scouts from up here come back with their little Wild

West story about knocking down this yere mountain on top of you. We had

to believe them because they brought back a little proof with them. Mex

guns and spurs and such plunder looted off'n the deceased on the field

of battle. Bill here can tell you."
"They was only two of them," said Windy Bill, diffident for the first

time in his life, "and we managed to catch one of 'em foul. We been

digging here for too long. We ain't no prairie dogs to go delving into

the bosom of the earth. We thought you must be plumb deceased anyhow: we

couldn't get a peep out of you. I was in favour of leavin' you lay

myself. This yere butte seemed like a first-rate imposing tomb; and I

was willing myself to carve a few choice sentiments on some selected

rock. Sure I can carve! But Jed here allowed that you owed him ten

dollars and maybe had some money in your pocket——"
"Shut up, Windy," I broke in. "Can't you see the young lady——"
Windy whirled all contrition and apologies.
"Don't you mind me, ma'am," he begged. "They call me Windy Bill, and I

reckon that's about right. I don't mean nothing. And we'd have dug all

through this butte before——"
"I know that. It isn't your talk," interrupted Miss Emory, "but the sun

is hot—and—haven't you anything at all to eat?"
[Pg 112]"Suffering giraffes!" cried Windy above the chorus of dismay.

"Lunkheads! chumps! Of all the idiot plays ever made in this territory!"

He turned to the dismayed group. "Ain't any one of you boys had sense

enough to bring any grub?"
But nobody had. The old-fashioned Arizona cowboy ate only twice a day.

It would never occur to him to carry a lunch for noon. Still, they might

have considered a rescue party's probable needs.
We mounted and started for the Box Springs ranch. They had at least

known enough to bring extra horses.
"Old Hooper knows the cat is out of the bag now," I suggested as we rode

along.
"He sure does."
"Do you think he'll stick: or will he get out?"
"He'll stick."
"I don't know——" I argued, doubtfully.
"I do," with great positiveness.
"Why are you so sure?"
"There are men in the brush all around his ranch to see that he does."
"For heaven's sake how many have you got together?" I cried, astonished.
"About three hundred," said Jed.
"What's the plan?"
"I don't know. They were chewing over it when I left. But I'll bet

something's going to pop. There's a bunch of 'em on that sweet little

list you-all dug up."
We rode slowly. It was near five o'clock when we pulled down the lane

toward the big corrals. The latter were full [Pg 113]of riding horses, and the

fences were topped with neatly arranged saddles. Men were everywhere,

seated in rows on top rails, gathered in groups, leaning idly against

the ranch buildings. There was a feeling of waiting.
We were discovered and acclaimed with a wild yell that brought everybody

running. Immediately we were surrounded. Escorted by a clamouring

multitude we moved slowly down the lane and into the enclosure.
There awaited us a dozen men headed by Buck Johnson. They emerged from

the office as we drew up. At sight of them the cowboys stopped, and we

moved forward alone. For here were the substantial men of this part of

the territory, the old timers, who had come in the early days and who

had persisted through the Indian wars, the border forays, the cattle

rustlings, through drought and enmity and bad years. A grim, elderly,

four-square, unsmiling little band of granite-faced pioneers, their very

appearance carried a conviction of direct and, if necessary, ruthless

action. At sight of them my heart leaped. Twenty-four hours previous my

case had seemed none too joyful. Now, mainly by my own efforts, after

all, I was no longer alone.
They did not waste time in vain congratulations or query. The occasion

was too grave for such side issues. Buck Johnson said something very

brief to the effect that he was glad to see us safe.
"If this young lady will come in first," he suggested.
But I was emboldened to speak up.
"This young lady has not had a bite to eat since last night," I

interposed.
The señor bent on me his grave look.
[Pg 114]"Thank you," said he. "Sing!" he roared, and then to the Chinaman who

showed up in a nervous hover: "Give this lady grub, savvy? If you'll go

with him, ma'am, he'll get you up something. Then we'd like to see you."
"I can perfectly well wait——" she began.
"I'd rather not, ma'am," said Buck with such grave finality that she

merely bowed and followed the cook.

[Pg 115]
CHAPTER XV
They had no tender feelings about me, however. Nobody cared whether I

ever ate or not. I was led into the little ranch office and catechized

to a fare-ye-well. They sat and roosted and squatted about, emitting

solemn puffs of smoke and speaking never a word; and the sun went down

in shafts of light through the murk, and the old shadows of former days

crept from the corners. When I had finished my story it was dusk.
And on the heels of my recital came the sound of hoofs in a hurry; and

presently loomed in the doorway the gigantic figure of Tom Thorne, the

sheriff. He peered, seeing nothing through the smoke and the twilight;

and the old timers sat tight and smoked.
"Buck Johnson here?" asked Thorne in his big voice.
"Here," replied the señor.
"I am told," said Thorne, directly, "that there is here an assembly for

unlawful purposes. If so, I call on you in the name of the law to keep

the peace."
"Tom," rejoined Buck Johnson, "I want you to make me your deputy."
"For what purpose?"
"There is a dispossession notice to be served hereabouts; a trespasser

who must be put off from property that is not his."
[Pg 116]"You men are after Hooper, and I know it. Now you can't run your

neighbours' quarrels with a gun, not anymore. This is a country of law

now."
"Tom," repeated Buck in a reasoning tone, "come in. Strike a light if

you want to: and take a look around. There's a lot of your friends here.

There's Jim Carson over in the corner, and Donald Macomber, and Marcus

Malley, and Dan Watkins."
At this slow telling of the most prominent names in the southwest cattle

industry Tom Thorne took a step into the room and lighted a match. The

little flame, held high above his head, burned down to his fingers while

he stared at the impassive faces surrounding him. Probably he had

thought to interfere dutifully in a local affair of considerable

seriousness; and there is no doubt that Tom Thorne was never afraid of

his duty. But here was Arizona itself gathered for purposes of its own.

He hardly noticed when the flame scorched his fingers.
"Tom," said Buck Johnson after a moment, "I heerd tell of a desperate

criminal headed for Grant's Pass, and I figure you can just about catch

up with him if you start right now and keep on riding. Only you'd better

make me your deputy first. It'll sort of leave things in good legal

responsible hands, as you can always easy point out if asked."
Tom gulped.
"Raise your right hand," he commanded, curtly, and administered the

oath. "Now I leave it in your hands to preserve the peace," he

concluded. "I call you all to witness."
"That's all right, Tom," said Buck, still in his crooning [Pg 117]tones, taking

the big sheriff by the elbow and gently propelling him toward the door,

"now as to this yere criminal over toward Grant's Pass, he was a little

bit of a runt about six foot three tall; heavy set, weight about a

hundred and ten; light complected with black hair and eyes. You can't

help but find him. Tom's a good sort," he observed, coming back, "but

he's young. He don't realize yet that when things get real serious this

sheriff foolishness just nat'rally bogs down. Now I reckon we'd better

talk to the girl."
I made a beeline for the cook house while they did that and filled up

for three. By the time I had finished, the conference was raised, and

men were catching and saddling their mounts. I did not intend to get

left out, you may be sure, so I rustled around and borrowed me a saddle

and a horse, and was ready to start with the rest.
We jogged up the road in a rough sort of column, the old timers riding

ahead in a group of their own. No injunction had been laid as to keeping

quiet; nevertheless, conversation was sparse and low voiced. The men

mostly rode in silence smoking their cigarettes. About half way the

leaders summoned me, and I trotted up to join them.
They wanted to know about the situation of the ranch as I had observed

it. I could not encourage them much. My recollection made of the place a

thoroughly protected walled fortress, capable of resisting a

considerable assault.
"Of course with this gang we could sail right over them," observed Buck,

thoughtfully, "but we'd lose a considerable of men doing it."
"Ain't no chance of sneaking somebody inside?" suggested Watkins.
[Pg 118]"Got to give Old Man Hooper credit for some sense," replied the señor,

shortly.
"We can starve 'em out," suggested somebody.
"Unless I miss the old man a mile he's already got a messenger headed

for the troops at Fort Huachuca," interposed Macomber. "He ain't fool

enough to take chances on a local sheriff."
"You're tooting he ain't," approved Buck Johnson. "It's got to be quick

work."
"Burn him out," said Watkins.
"It's the young lady's property," hesitated my boss. "I kind of hate to

destroy it unless we have to."
At this moment the Morgan stallion, which I had not noticed before, was

reined back to join our little group. Atop him rode the diminutive form

of Artie Brower whom I had thought down and out. He had evidently had

his evening's dose of hop and under the excitation of the first effect

had joined the party. His derby hat was flattened down to his ears.

Somehow it exasperated me.
"For heaven's sake why don't you get you a decent hat!" I muttered, but

to myself. He was carrying that precious black bag.
"Blow a hole in his old walls!" he suggested, cheerfully. "That old fort

was built against Injins. A man could sneak up in the shadow and set her

off. It wouldn't take but a dash of soup to stick a hole you could ride

through a-horseback."
"Soup?" echoed Buck.
"Nitroglycerine," explained Watkins, who had once been a miner.
[Pg 119]"Oh, sure!" agreed Buck, sarcastically. "And where'd we get it?"
"I always carry a little with me just for emergencies," asserted Brower,

calmly, and patted his black bag.
There was a sudden and unanimous edging away.
"For the love of Pete!" I cried. "Was there some of that stuff in there

all the time I've been carrying it around?"
"It's packed good: it can't go off," Artie reassured us. "I know my

biz."
"What in God's name do you want such stuff for!" cried Judson.
"Oh, just emergencies," answered Brower, vaguely, but I remembered his

uncanny skill in opening the combination of the safe. Possibly that

contract between Emory and Hooper had come into his hands through

professional activities. However, that did not matter.
"I can make a drop of soup go farther than other men a pint," boasted

Artie. "I'll show you: and I'll show that old——"
"You'll probably get shot," observed Buck, watching him closely.
"W'at t'hell," observed Artie with an airy gesture.
"It's the dope he takes," I told Johnson aside. "It only lasts about so

long. Get him going before it dies on him."
"I see. Trot right along," Buck commanded.
Taking this as permission Brower clapped heels to the stallion and shot

away like an arrow.
"Hold on! Stop! Oh, damn!" ejaculated the señor. "He'll gum the whole

game!" He spurred forward in pursuit, realized the hopelessness of

trying to catch the Morgan, [Pg 120]and reined down again to a brisk travelling

canter. We surmounted the long, slow rise this side of Hooper's in time

to see a man stand out in the brush, evidently for the purpose of

challenging the horseman. Artie paid him not the slightest attention,

but swept by magnificently, the great stallion leaping high in his

restrained vitality. The outpost promptly levelled his rifle. We saw the

vivid flash in the half light. Brower reeled in his saddle, half fell,

caught himself by the stallion's mane and clung, swinging to and fro.

The horse, freed of control, tossed his head, laid back his ears, and

ran straight as an arrow for the great doors of the ranch.
We uttered a simultaneous groan of dismay. Then with one accord we

struck spurs and charged at full speed, grimly and silently. Against the

gathering hush of evening rose only the drum-roll of our horses' hoofs

and the dust cloud of their going. Except that Buck Johnson, rising in

his stirrups, let off three shots in the air; and at the signal from all

points around the beleagured ranch men arose from the brush and mounted

concealed horses, and rode out into the open with rifles poised.
The stallion thundered on; and the little jockey managed to cling to the

saddle, though how he did it none of us could tell. In the bottomland

near the ranch he ran out of the deeper dusk into a band of the strange,

luminous after-glow that follows erratically sunset in wide spaces. Then

we could see that he was not only holding his seat, but was trying to do

something, just what we could not make out. The reins were flying free,

so there was no question of regaining control.
[Pg 121]A shot flashed at him from the ranch; then a second; after which, as

though at command, the firing ceased. Probably the condition of affairs

had been recognized.
All this we saw from a distance. The immensity of the Arizona country,

especially at dusk when the mountains withdraw behind their veils and

mystery flows into the bottomlands, has always a panoramic quality that

throws small any human-sized activities. The ranch houses and their

attendant trees look like toys; the bands of cattle and the men working

them are as though viewed through the reverse lenses of a glass; and the

very details of mesquite or sacatone flats, of alkali shallow or of

oak grove are blended into broad washes of tone. But now the distant,

galloping horse with its swaying mannikin charging on the ranch seemed

to fill our world. The great forces of portent that hover aloof in the

dusk of the desert stooped as with a rush of wings. The peaceful, wide

spaces and the veiled hills and the brooding skies were swept clear.

Crisis filled our souls: crisis laid her hand on every living moving

thing in the world, stopping it in its tracks so that the very

infinities for a brief, weird period seemed poised over the running

horse and the swaying, fumbling man.
At least that is the way it affected me; and subsequent talk leads me to

believe that that it is how it affected every man jack of us. We all had

different ways of expressing it. Windy Bill subsequently remarked: "I

felt like some old Injun He-God had just told me to crawl in my hole and

give them that knew how a chanct."
But I know we all stopped short, frozen in our tracks, and stared, and I

don't believe man, or horse, drew a deep breath.
[Pg 122]Nearer and nearer the stallion drew to the ranch. Now he was within a

few yards. In another moment he would crash head on, at tremendous

speed, into the closed massive doors. The rider seemed to have regained

somewhat of his strength. He was sitting straight in the saddle, was no

longer clinging. But apparently he was making no effort to regain

control. His head was bent and he was still fumbling at something. The

distance was too great for us to make out what, but that much we could

see.
On flew the stallion at undiminished speed. He was running blind; and

seemingly nothing could save him from a crash. But at almost the last

moment the great doors swung back. Those within had indeed realized the

situation and were meeting it. At the same instant Brower rose in his

stirrups and brought his arm forward in a wide, free swing. A blinding

glare flashed across the world. We felt the thud and heave of a

tremendous explosion. Dust obliterated everything.
"Charge, you coyotes! Charge!" shrieked Buck Johnson.
And at full speed, shrieking like fiends, we swept across flats.

[Pg 123]
CHAPTER XVI
There was no general resistance. We tumbled pell mell through the breach

into the courtyard, encountering only terror-stricken wretches who

cowered still dazed by the unexpectedness and force of the explosion. In

the excitement order and command were temporarily lost. The men swarmed

through the ranch buildings like locusts. Señor Buck Johnson and the

other old timers let them go; but I noticed they themselves scattered

here and there keeping a restraining eye on activities. There was to be

no looting: and that was early made plain.
But before matters had a chance to go very far we were brought up all

standing by the sound of shots outside. A rush started in that

direction: but immediately Buck Johnson asserted his authority and took

command. He did not intend to have his men shot unnecessarily.
By now it was pitch dark. A reconnaissance disclosed a little battle

going on down toward the water corrals. Two of our men, straying in that

direction, had been fired upon. They had promptly gone down on their

bellies and were shooting back.
"I think they've got down behind the water troughs," one of these men

told me as I crawled up alongside. "Cain't say how many there is. They

shore do spit fire considerable. I'm just cuttin' loose where I see the

flash. When [Pg 124]I shoot, you prepare to move and move lively. One of those

horned toads can sure shoot some; and it ain't healthy to linger none

behind your own flash."
The boys, when I crawled back with my report, were eager to pile in and

rush the enemy.
"Just put us a hoss-back, señor," pleaded Windy Bill, "and we'll run

right over them like a Shanghai rooster over a little green snake. They

can't hit nothing moving fast in the dark."
"You'll do just what I say," rejoined Buck Johnson, fiercely. "Cow hands

are scarce, and I don't aim to lose one except in the line of business.

If any man gets shot to-night, he's out of luck. He'd better get shot

good and dead; or he'll wish he had been. That goes! There can't be but

a few of those renegades out there, and we'll tend to them in due order.

Watkins," he addressed that old timer, "you tend to this. Feel around

cautious. Fill up the place full of lead. Work your men around through

the brush until you get them surrounded, and then just squat and shoot

and wait for morning."
Watkins sent out a dozen of the nearest men to circle the water troughs

in order to cut off further retreat, if that were projected. Then he

went about methodically selecting others to whom he assigned various

stations.
"Now you get a-plenty of catteridges," he told them, "and you lay low

and shoot 'em off. And if any of you gets shot I'll sure skin him

alive!"
In the meantime, the locomotive lantern had been lit so that the

interior of the courtyard was thrown into brilliant light. Needless to

say the opening blown in the walls did [Pg 125]not face toward the water

corrals. Of Artie Brower and the Morgan stallion we found hardly a

trace. They had been literally blown to pieces. Not one of us who had

known him but felt in his heart a kindly sorrow for the strange little

man. The sentry who had fired at him and who had thus, indirectly,

precipitated the catastrophe, was especially downcast.
"I told him to stop, and he kep' right on a-going, so I shot at him," he

explained. "What else was I to do? How was I to know he didn't belong to

that gang? He acted like it."
But when you think of it how could it have come out better? Poor, weak,

vice-ridden, likeable little beggar, what could the future have held for

him? And it is probable that his death saved many lives.
The prisoners were brought in—some forty of them, for Old Man Hooper

maintained only the home ranch and all his cow hands as well as his

personal bravos were gathered here. Buck Johnson separated apart seven

of them, and ordered the others into the stables under guard.
"Bad hombres, all of them," he observed to Jed Parker. "We'll just

nat'rally ship them across the line very pronto. But these seven are

worse than bad hombres. We'll have to see about them."
But neither Andreas, Ramon, nor Old Man Hooper himself were among those

present.
"Maybe they slipped out through our guards; but I doubt it," said Buck.

"I believe we've identified that peevish lot by the water troughs."
The firing went on quite briskly for a while; then slack[Pg 126]ened, and

finally died to an occasioned burst, mainly from our own side. Under our

leader's direction the men fed their horses and made themselves

comfortable. I was summoned to the living quarters to explain on the

spot the events that had gone before. Here we examined more carefully

and in detail the various documents—the extraordinary directions to

Ramon; the list of prospective victims to be offered at the tomb, so to

speak, of Old Man Hooper; and the copy of the agreement between Emory

and Hooper. The latter, as I had surmised, stated in so many words that

it superceded and nullified an old partnership agreement. This started

us on a further search which was at last rewarded by the discovery of

that original partnership. It contained, again as I had surmised, the

not-uncommon clause that in case of the death of one or the other of the

partners without direct heirs the common property should revert to the

other. I felt very stuck on myself for a good guesser. The only trouble

was that the original of the second agreement was lacking: we had only a

copy, and of course without signatures. It will be remembered that

Brower said he had deposited it with a third party, and that third party

was to us unknown. We could not even guess in what city he lived. Of

course we could advertise. But Windy Bill who—leaning his long figure

against the wall—had been listening in silence—a pretty fair young

miracle in itself—had a good idea, which was the real miracle, in my

estimation.
"Look here," he broke in, "if I've been following the plot of this yere

dime novel correctly, it's plumb easy. Just catch Jud—Jud—you know,

the editor of the Cochise [Pg 127]Branding Iron, and get him to telegraph a

piece to the other papers that Artie Brower, celebrated jockey et

ceterer, has met a violent death at Hooper's ranch, details as yet

unknown. That's the catch-word, as I savey it. When this yere third

party sees that, he goes and records the paper, and there you are!"
Windy leaned back dramatically and looked exceedingly pleased with

himself.
"Yes, that's it," approved Buck, briefly, which disappointed Windy, who

was looking for high encomium.
At this moment a messenger came in from the firing party to report that

apparently all opposition had ceased. At least there had been for some

time no shooting from the direction of the water troughs; a fact

concealed from us by the thickness of the ranch walls. Buck Johnson

immediately went out to confer with Watkins.
"I kind of think we've got 'em all," was the latter's opinion. "We

haven't had a sound out of 'em for a half hour. It may be a trick, of

course."
"Sure they haven't slipped by you?" suggested the señor.
"Pretty certain. We've got a close circle."
"Well, I wouldn't take chances in the dark. Just lay low 'till morning."
We returned to the ranch house where, after a little further discussion,

I bedded down and immediately fell into a deep sleep. This was more and

longer continued excitement than I was used to.
I was afoot with the first stirrings of dawn, you may be sure, and out

to join the party that moved with infinite [Pg 128]precaution on the water

troughs as soon as it was light enough to see clearly. We found them

riddled with bullets and the water all run out. Gleaming brass

cartridges scattered, catching the first rays of the sun, attested the

vigour of the defence. Four bodies lay huddled on the ground under the

partial shelter of the troughs. I saw Ramon, his face frowning and

sinister even in death, his right hand still grasping tenaciously the

stock of his Winchester; and Andreas flat on his face; and two others

whom I did not recognize. Ramon had been hit at least four times. But of

Hooper himself was no hide nor hair! So certain had we been that he had

escaped to this spot with his familiars that we were completely taken

aback at his absence.
"We got just about as much sense as a bunch of sheepmen!" cried Buck

Johnson, exasperated. "He's probably been hiding out somewhere about the

place. God knows where he is by now!"
But just as we were about to return to the ranch house we were arrested

by a shout from one of the cowboys who had been projecting around the

neighbourhood. He came running to us. In his hand he held a blade of

sacatone on which he pointed out a single dark spot about the size of

the head of a pin. Buck seized it and examined it closely.
"Blood, all right," he said at last. "Where did you get this, son?"
The man, a Chiracahua hand named Curley something-or-other, indicated a

sacatone bottom a hundred yards to the west.
"You got good eyes, son," Buck complimented him. "Think you can make out

the trail?"
[Pg 129]"Do'no," said Curley. "Used to do a considerable of tracking."
"Horses!" commanded Buck.
We followed Curley afoot while several men went to saddle up. On the

edge of the two-foot jump-off we grouped ourselves waiting while Curley,

his brows knit tensely, quartered here and there like a setter dog. He

was a good trailer, you could see that in a minute. He went at it right.

After quite a spell he picked up a rock and came back to show it. I

should never have noticed anything—merely another tiny black spot among

other spots—but Buck nodded instantly he saw it.
"It's about ten rods west of whar I found the grass," said Curley.

"Looks like he's headed for that water in Cockeye Basin. From thar he

could easy make Cochise when he got rested."
"Looks likely," agreed Buck. "Can't you find no footprints?"
"Too much tramped up by cowboys and other jackasses," said Curley.

"It'll come easier when we get outside this yere battlefield."
He stood erect, sizing up the situation through half-squinted eyes.
"You-all wait here," he decided. "Chances are he kept right on up the

broad wash."
He mounted one of the horses that had now arrived and rode at a lope to

a point nearly half a mile west. There he dismounted and tied his horse

to the ground. After rather a prolonged search he raised his hand over

his head and described several small horizontal circles in the air.
[Pg 130]"Been in the army, have you?" muttered Buck; "well, I will say you're a

handy sort of leather-leg to have around. He gave the soldier signal for

'assemble'," he answered Jed Parker's question.
We rode over to join Curley.
"It's all right; he came this way," said the latter; but he did not

trouble to show us indications. I am a pretty fair game trailer myself,

but I could make out nothing.
We proceeded slowly, Curley afoot leading his horse. The direction

continued to be toward Cockeye. Sometimes we could all see plain

footprints; again the trail was, at least as far as I was concerned, a

total loss. Three times we found blood, once in quite a splash.

Occasionally even Curley was at fault for a few moments; but in general

he moved forward at a rapid walk.
"This Curley person is all right," observed Windy Bill after a while, "I

was brung up to find my way about, and I can puzzle out most anywhere a

critter has gone and left a sign; but this yere Curley can track a

humming bird acrost a granite boulder!"
After a little while Curley stopped for us to catch up.
"Seems to me no manner of doubt but what he's headed for Cockeye," he

said. "There ain't no other place for him to go out this way. I reckon I

can pick up enough of this trail just riding along. If we don't find no

sign at Cockeye, we can just naturally back track and pick up where he

turned off. We'll save time that-away, and he's had plenty of time to

get thar and back again."
So Curley mounted and we rode on at a walk on the horse [Pg 131]trail that led

up the broad, shallow wash that came out of Cockeye.
Curley led, of course. Then rode Buck Johnson and Watkins and myself. I

had horned in on general principles, and nobody kicked. I suppose they

thought my general entanglement with this extraordinary series of events

entitled me to more than was coming to me as ordinary cow hand. For a

long time we proceeded in silence. Then, as we neared the hills, Buck

began to lay out his plan.
"When we come up on Cockeye," he was explaining, "I want you to take a

half dozen men or so and throw around the other side on the Cochise

trail——"
His speech was cut short by the sound of a rifle shot. The country was

still flat, unsuited for concealment or defence. We were riding

carelessly. A shivering shock ran through my frame and my horse plunged

wildly. For an instant I thought I must be hit, then I saw that the

bullet had cut off cleanly the horn of my saddle—within two inches of

my stomach!
Surprise paralyzed us for the fraction of a second. Then we charged the

rock pile from which the shot had come.
We found there Old Man Hooper seated in a pool of his own blood. He had

been shot through the body and was dead. His rifle lay across a rock,

trained carefully on the trail. How long he had sat there nursing the

vindictive spark of his vitality nobody will ever know—certainly for

some hours. And the shot delivered had taken from him the last flicker

of life.
"By God, he was sure game!" Buck Johnson pronounced his epitaph.

[Pg 132]
CHAPTER XVII
We cleaned up at the ranch and herded our prisoners together and rode

back to Box Springs. The seven men who had been segregated from the rest

by Buck Johnson were not among them. I never found out what had become

of them nor who had executed whatever decrees had been pronounced

against them. There at the home ranch we found Miss Emory very anxious,

excited, and interested. Buck and the others in authority left me to

inform her of what had taken place.
I told you some time back that this is no love story; but I may as well

let you in on the whole sequel to it, and get it off my chest. Windy's

scheme brought immediate results. The partnership agreement was

recorded, and after the usual legal red-tape Miss Emory came into the

property. She had to have a foreman for the ranch, and hanged if she

didn't pick on me! Think of that; me an ordinary, forty-dollar cow

puncher! I tried to tell her that it was all plumb foolishness, that

running a big cattle ranch was a man-sized job and took experience, but

she wouldn't listen. Women are like that. She'd seen me blunder in and

out of a series of adventures and she thought that settled it, that I

was a great man. After arguing with her quite some time about it, I had

to give in; so I spit on my hands and sailed in to do my little

darndest. I expected the men who realized [Pg 133]fully how little I knew about

it all would call me a brash damn fool or anyway give me the horse

laugh; but I fooled myself. They were mightily decent. Jed Parker or Sam

Wooden or Windy Bill were always just happening by and roosting on the

corral rails. Then if I listened to them—and I always did—I learned a

heap about what I ought to do. Why, even Buck Johnson himself came and

stayed at the ranch with me for more than a week at the time of the fall

round-up: and he never went near the riding, but just projected around

here and there looking over my works and ways. And in the evenings he

would smoke and utter grave words of executive wisdom which I treasured

and profited by.
If a man gives his whole mind to it, he learns practical things fast.

Even a dumb-head Wop gets his English rapidly when he's where he has to

talk that or nothing. Inside of three years I had that ranch paying, and

paying big. It was due to my friends whom I had been afraid of, and I'm

not ashamed to say so. There's Herefords on our range now instead of

that lot of heady long-horns Old Man Hooper used to run; and we're

growing alfalfa and hay in quantity for fattening when they come in off

the ranges. Got considerable hogs, too, and hogs are high—nothing but

pure blood Poland. I figure I've added fully fifty per cent., if not

more, to the value of the ranch as it came to me. No, I'm not bragging;

I'm explaining how came it I married my wife and figured to keep my

self-respect. I'd have married her anyhow. We've been together now

fifteen years, and I'm here to say that she's a humdinger of a girl,

game as a badger, better looking every day, knows cattle [Pg 134]and alfalfa

and sunsets and sonatas and Poland hogs—but I said this was no love

story, and it isn't!
The day following the taking of the ranch and the death of Old Man

Hooper we put our prisoners on horses and started along with them toward

the Mexican border. Just outside of Soda Springs whom should we meet up

with but big Tom Thorne, the sheriff.
"Evenin', Buck," said he.
"Evenin'," replied the señor.
"What you got here?"
"This is a little band of religious devotees fleein' persecution," said

Buck.
"And what are you up to with them?" asked Thorne.
"We're protecting them out of Christian charity from the dangers of the

road until they reach the Promised Land."
"I see," said Thorne, reflectively. "Whereabouts lays this Promised

Land?"
"About sixty mile due south."
"You sure to get them all there safe and sound—I suppose you'd be

willing to guarantee that nothing's going to happen to them, Buck?"
"I give my word on that, Tom."
"All right," said Thorne, evidently relieved. He threw his leg over the

horn of his saddle. "How about that little dispossession matter, deputy?

You ain't reported on that."
"It's all done and finished."
"Have any trouble?"
"Nary trouble," said Señor Buck Johnson, blandly, "all went off quiet

and serene."

THE ROAD AGENT

CHAPTER I
The Sierra Nevadas of California are very wide and very high. Kingdoms

could be lost among the defiles of their ranges. Kingdoms have been

found there. One of them was Bright's Cove.
It happened back in the seventies. Old Man Bright was prospecting. He

had come up from the foothills accompanied by a new but stolid Indian

wife. After he had grubbed around a while on old Italian bar and had

succeeded in washing out a little colour, she woke up and took a slight

interest in the proceedings.
"You like catch dat?" she grunted, contemptuously. "Heap much over

dere!"
She waved an arm. Old Man Bright girded his loins and packed his

jackass. After incredible scramblings the two succeeded in surmounting

the ranges and in dropping sheer to the mile-wide round valley through

which flowed the river—the broad, swift mountain river, with the

snow-white rapids and the swirling translucent green of very thick

grass. They were very glad to reach the grass at the bottom, but a

little doubtful on how to get out. The big mountains took root at the

very edge of the tiny round valley; the river flowed out of a gorge at

one end and into a gorge at the other.
[Pg 136]"Guess the sun don't rise here 'til next morning," commented Old Man

Bright. The squaw was too busy even to grunt.
In six years Old Man Bright was worth six million dollars, all taken

from the ledges of Bright's Cove. Of this amount he had been forced to

let go of a small proportion for mill machinery and labour. He had also

invested twenty-five thousand dollars in a road. It was a steep road,

and a picturesque. It wound in and out and around, by loops, lacets, and

hairpins, dropping down the face of the mountain in unheard-of grades

and turns. Nothing was ever hauled up it, save yellow bars of

bullion—so that did not matter. Down it, with a shriek of brakes, a

cloud of dust, a clank of harness and a rumble of oaths, came divers

matters, such as machinery, glassware, whiskey, mirrors, ammunition, and

pianos. From any one of a dozen bold points on this road one could see

far down and far up its entire white, thread-like length. The tiny

crawling teams each with its puff of dust crawling with it; the great

tumbled peaks of the Sierras; the river so far below as to resemble a

little stream, the round Cove with its toy houses and its distant

ant-like industry—all these were plainly to be seized by a glance of

whatever eye cared to look.
As time went on a great many teams and pack trains and saddle animals

climbed up and down that road. Bright's Cove became quite a town. Old

Man Bright made six millions; other men aggregated nearly four millions

more; still others acquired deep holes and a deficit. It might be

remarked in passing that the squaw acquired experience, a calico dress

or so, and a final honourable discharge. Being [Pg 137]an Indian she quite

cheerfully went back to pounding acorns in a metate.
In the fifth year of prosperity there drifted into camp two men,

possessed of innocence, three mules, and a thousand dollars. They

retained the mules; and, it is to be presumed, at least a portion of the

innocence.
The thousand dollars went to the purchase of the Lost Dog from Barney

Fallan. The Lost Dog consisted quite simply of a hole in the ground

guarded by an excellent five stamp-mill. The latter's existence could

only be explained by the incurable optimism of Barney Fallan—certainly

not by the contents of the hole in the ground. To the older men of the

camp it seemed a shame, for the newcomers were nice, fresh-cheeked,

clear-eyed lads to whom everything was new and strange and wonderful,

their enthusiasm was contagious, and their cheerful command of

vernacular exceedingly heart-warming. California John, then a man in his

forties, tried to head off the deal.
"Look here, son," said he to Gaynes. "Don't do it. There's nothin' in

it. Take my word."
"But Fallan's got a good stamp-mill all ready for business, and the

ledge——"
"Son," said California John, "every once in a while the Lord gets to

experimentin' makin' brains for a new species of jackass, and when he

runs out of donkeys to put 'em in——"
"Meaning me?" demanded Gaynes, his fair skin turning a deep red.
"Not at all. Meanin' Barney Fallan."
Nevertheless the Babes, as the Gaynes brothers were [Pg 138]speedily nicknamed,

paid over their good thousand for Barney's worthless prospect with the

imposing but ridiculous stamp-mill. There they set cheerfully to work.

After a week's desperate and clanking experiment they got the machinery

under way and began to run rock through the crushers.
"It ain't even ore!" expostulated California John. "Why, son, it's only

country rock. Go down on your shaft until you strike a pan test, anyway!

You're wasting time and fuel and—Oh, hell!" he broke off hopelessly at

the sight of the two cherubic faces upturned respectful but unconvinced.
"But you never can tell where you will find gold," broke in Jimmy,

eagerly. "That's been proved over and over again. I heard one fellow say

once that they thought they'd never find gold in hornblende. But they

did."
California John stumped home in indignant disgust.
"Damn little ijits!" he exploded. "Pigheaded! Stubborn as a pair of

mules!" The recollection of the scrubbed red cheeks, the clear,

puppy-dog, frank brown eyes, the close-curling brown hair, forced his

lips to a wry grin. "Just like I was at that age," he admitted. He

sighed. "Well, they'll drop their little pile, of course. The only ray

of hope's the experience that old Bible fellow had with them turkey

buzzards—or was it ravens?"
The Babes pecked away for about a month, full of tribulation and

questions. They seemed to depend almost equally on optimism and chance,

in both of which they had supreme faith. A huge horseshoe was tacked

over the door of the stamp-mill. Jimmy Gaynes always spat over his right

[Pg 139]shoulder before doing a day's work. They never walked under the short

ladders leading to the hoppers. Neither would they permit visitors to

their shafts. To California John and his friend Tibbetts they interposed

scandalized objections.
"It's bad luck to let another man in your shaft!" cried George. "I'm no

high-brow on this mining proposition, but I know enough for that."
"Bad as playing opposite a cross-eyed man," said Jimmy.
"Or holding Jacks full on Eights," supplemented George, conclusively.
"You're about as wise as a treeful of owls," said California John,

sarcastically. "But, Lord love you, I ain't cherishin' any very burnin'

ambition to crawl down your snake hole."
The Babes used up their provisions; they went about as far as they could

on credit; they harrowed the feelings of the community—and then, in a

very mild way, they struck it. Together they drifted down the single

street of the camp, arm in arm, an elaborate nonchalance steadying their

steps. Near the horse trough they paused.
"Gold," said Jimmy, oracularly, to George, "is where you find it."
"Likewise horse sense," quoth George.
Whereupon they whooped wildly and descended on the astonished group. To

it they exhibited yellow dust to the value of an hundred dollars. "And

more where that came from," said they.
"What kind of rock did you find it in?" demanded Tibbetts, after he had

recovered his breath from the youngsters' enthusiastic man-handling.
[Pg 140]"Oh, a kind of red, pasty-looking rock," said they.
"Show us," demanded the miners.
"What?" cried Jimmy, astounded, "and give Old Man Luck the backhand slap

just when he's decided to buy a corner lot in the Gaynes Addition? Not

on your saccharine existence!"
"But we'll show you some more of this to-morrow Q.M.," said George.
They bought drinks all round, and paid their various bills, and departed

again feverishly to the Lost Dog whence rose smoke and clankings. And

next day, sure enough, they left their work just long enough to exhibit

another respectable little clean-up of fifty dollars or so.
"And we're just getting into it!" said George, triumphantly.
California John and all the rest of his good friends rejoiced

exceedingly and genuinely. They liked the Babes. The little strike of

the Lost Dog quite overshadowed in importance the fact that old man

Bright's "Clarice" had run into a fabulously rich pocket.
The end of the month drew near. The Lost Dog had produced nearly eight

hundred dollars. The Babes waxed important and talked largely of their

moneyed interests.
"I think," said Jimmy, importantly, "that we will decide to keep three

hundred dollars to boost the game; and nail down the rest where moths

won't corrupt. Where do you fellows salt your surplus, anyway?"
"There's an express goes out pretty soon," someone explained, "with the

clean-up of the Clarice. We send our dust out with that; and I reckon

you can fix it with Bright."
[Pg 141]They saw Bright, but ran up against an unexpected difficulty. Old Man

Bright received them with considerable surliness. He considered himself

as the originator, discoverer, inventor, and almost the proprietor of

Bright's Cove and all it contained. Therefore, when he first heard of

the new strike, he walked up to the Lost Dog to see what it looked like.

The Babes, panic stricken at the intended affront to "Old Man Luck,"

headed him off. Bright had not the least belief in the reason given. He

surveyed them with disfavour.
"I can't take your package," he told them. "Send it out yourself."
"And that old skunk has cleaned up a hundred thousand this month!"

complained Jimmy, pathetically, to the group around the horse trough.

"And he won't even take a pore little five hundred package of dust out

to some suffering bank! I suppose I'll have to cache it in a tomato can

for Johnson's old billy goat to chew up."
"Bring it over and I'll shove it in with mine," suggested California

John.
So it was done. The express, carrying nearly four hundred pounds of gold

dust, set forth over the steep road. In two hours the driver and

messenger sailed in, bung-eyed with excitement. They had been held up by

a single road agent.
"He come out right on that point of rocks where you can see the whole

valley," said the driver in answer to many questions, "right where the

heavy grade is and the thick chaparral. We was busy climbing; and he had

us before we could wink. Made us drop off the dust and 'bout face. He

was a big, tall feller; and had a sawed-off Winchester. [Pg 142]Once, when we

stopped, he dropped a bullet right behind us. He must have watched us

all the way to camp."
The camp turned out. As the men passed the Lost Dog someone yelled to

the Babes. George, covered with mud, came to the door of the mill.
"Gee!" said he. "Lucky we saved out that three hundred. I'm powerful

sorry for that suffering bank. I'll join you as soon as I can get Jimmy

up out of the shaft." Before the party had gone a mile they were joined

by the brothers boyishly eager over this new excitement.
The men toiled up the road to where the robbery had taken place. Plainly

to be seen were the marks of the man's boots. The tracks of a single

horse, walking, followed the man.
"He packed off the dust, and he had an almighty big horse to carry it,"

pronounced someone.
They followed the trail. It led a half mile to a broad sheet of rock.

There it disappeared. On one side the bank rose twenty or thirty feet.

On the other it fell away nearly a hundred. On the other side of the

sheet of rock stretched the dusty road unbroken by anything more recent

than the wheel-tracks of the day before. It was as though man and horse

had taken unto themselves wings.
Immediately Bright took active charge of the posse.
"Stand here, on this rock," he commanded. "This road's been tracked up

too much already. You, John, and Tibbetts and Simmins, there, come 'long

with me to see what you can make out."
The old mountaineers retraced their steps, examining [Pg 143]carefully every

inch of the ground. They returned vastly puzzled.
"No sabe," California John summed up their investigations. "There's the

man's track leadin' his hoss. The hoss had on new shoes, and the robber

did his own shoeing. So we ain't got any blacksmiths to help us."
"How do you know he shod the horse himself?" asked Jimmy Gaynes.
"Shoes just alike on front and back feet. Shows he must just have tacked

on ready-made shoes. A blacksmith shapes 'em different. Those tracks

leads right up to this rock: and here they quit. If you can figger how a

horse, a man, and nigh four hundredweight of gold dust got off this

rock, I'll be obleeged."
The men looked up at the perpendicular cliff to their right; over the

sheer precipice at their left; and upon the untracked deep, white dust

ahead.
"Furthermore," California John went on, impressively, after a moment,

"where did that man and that hoss come from in the beginning? Not from

up this way. They's no fresh tracks comin' down the road no more than

they's fresh tracks goin' up. Not from camp. They's no tracks

whatsomever on the road below, except our'n and the stage outfit's."
"Are you sure of that?" asked Jimmy, his eyes shining with interest.
"Sartin sure," replied California John, positively. "We didn't take no

chances on that."
"Then he must have come into the road from up the mountain or down the

mountain."
[Pg 144]"Where?" demanded California John. "A man afoot might scramble down in

one or two places; but not a hoss. They ain't no tracks either side the

muss-up where the express was stopped. And at that p'int the mountain is

straight up and down, like it is here."
They talked it over, and argued it, and reexamined the evidence, but

without avail. The stubborn facts remained: Between the hold-up and the

sheet of rock was one set of tracks going one way; elsewhere, nothing.

[Pg 145]
CHAPTER II
Nearly a year passed. If it had not been for the very tangible loss of a

hundred and fifty thousand dollars, the little community at Bright's

Cove might almost have come to doubt the evidence of their senses and

the accuracy of their memories, so fantastic on sober reflection did all

the circumstances become. Even the indisputable four hundred pounds of

gold could not quite avert an unconfessed suspicion of the uncanny.

Miners are superstitious folk. Old Man Bright remembered the parting and

involved curses of his squaw before she went back to her acorns and pine

nuts. To Tibbetts alone he imparted a vague hint of the imaginings into

which he had fallen. But he brooded much, seeking a plausible theory

that would not force him back on the powers of darkness. This he did not

find.
Nor did any other man. It remained a mystery, a single bizarre anomaly

in the life of the camp. For some time thereafter the express went

heavily guarded. The road was patrolled. Jimmy or George Gaynes in

person accompanied each shipment of dust. Their pay streak held out,

increased steadily in value. They would hire no assistance for the

actual mining in the shaft, although they had several hands to work at

the mill. One month they cleaned up twelve thousand dollars.
"You bet I'm going," said Jimmy, "I don't care if it is [Pg 146]only a little

compared to what Bright and you fellows are sending. It's a heap sight

to us, and I'm going to see it safe to the city. No more spooks in mine.

I got my fingers crossed. Allah skazallalum! I don't know what a ghost

would want with cash assets, but they seemed to use George's and my

little old five hundred, all right."
Twelve months went by. Two expresses a month toiled up the road. Nothing

happened. Finally Jimmy decided that four good working days a month were

a good deal to pay for apparently useless supervision. Three men

comprised the shot-gun guard. They, with the driver, were considered

ample.
"You'll have to get on without me," said Jimmy to them in farewell. "Be

good boys. We've got the biggest clean-up yet aboard you."
They started on the twenty-fifth trip since the hold-up. After a time,

far up the mountain was heard a single shot. Inside of two hours the

express drew sorrowfully into camp. The driver appeared to be alone. In

the bottom of the wagon were the three guards weak and sick. The gold

sacks were very much absent.
"Done it again," said the driver. "Ain't more than got started afore the

whole outfit's down with the belly-ache. Too much of that cursed salmon.

Told 'em so. I didn't eat none. That road agent hit her lucky this trip

sure. He was all organized for business. Never showed himself at all.

Just opened fire. Sent a bullet through the top of my hat. He's either a

damn good shot or a damn poor one. I hung up both hands and yelled we

was down and out. What could I do? This outfit couldn't a fit a bumble

[Pg 147]bee. And I couldn't git away, or git hold of no gun, or see anything to

shoot, if I did. He was behind that big rock."
The men nodded. They were many of them hard hit, but they had lived too

long in the West not to recognize the justice of the driver's implied

contention that he had done his best.
"He told me to throw out them sacks, and to be damn quick about it,"

went on the driver. "Then I drove home."
"What sort of a lookin' fellow was he?" asked someone. "Same one as last

year?"
"I never seen him," said the driver. "He hung behind his rock. He was

organized for shoot, and if the messengers hadn't happened to' a' been

out of it, I believe he could have killed us all."
"What did his hoss look like?" inquired California John.
"He didn't have no horse," stated the driver. "Leastways, not near him.

There was no cover. He might have been around a p'int. And I can sw'ar

to this: there weren't no tracks of no kind from there to camp."
They caught up horses and started out. When they came to the Lost Dog,

they stopped and looked at each other.
"Poor old Babes," said Simmins. "Biggest clean-up yet; and first time

one of 'em didn't go 'long."
"I'm glad they didn't," said Tibbetts. "That agent would have killed 'em

shore!"
They called out the Gaynes brothers and broke the news. For once the

jovial youngsters had no joke to make.
"This is getting serious," said Jimmy, seriously. "We can't afford to

lose that much."
[Pg 148]George whistled dolefully, and went into the corral for the mules.
The party toiled up the mountain. Plainly in the dust could be made out

the trail of the express ascending and descending. Plain also were the

signs where the driver had dumped out the gold bags and turned around.

From that point the tracks of a man and a horse led to the sheet of

rock. Beyond that, nothing.
The men stared at each other a little frightened. Somebody swore softly.
"Boys," said Bright in a strained voice, "do you know how much was in

that express? A half million! There's nary earthly hoss can carry over

half a ton! And this one treads as light as a saddler."
They looked at each other blankly. Several even glanced in apprehension

at the sky.
In a perfunctory manner, for the sake of doing something, those skilled

in trail-reading went back over the ground. Nothing was added to the

first experience. At the point of robbery magically had appeared a man

and—if the stage driver's solemn assertion that at the time of the

hold-up no animal was in sight could be believed—subsequently, when

needed, a large horse. Whence had they come? Not along the road in

either direction: the unbroken, deep dust assured that. Not down the

mountain from above, for the cliff rose sheer for at least three hundred

feet. Jimmy Gaynes, following unconsciously the general train of

conjecture, craned his neck over the edge of the road. The broken jagged

rock and shale dropped off an hundred feet to a tangle of manzanita and

snowbrush.
[Pg 149]California John looked over, too.
"Couldn't even get sheep up that," said he, "let alone a sixteen-hand

horse."
Old Man Bright was sunk in a superstitious torpor. He had lost hundreds

of thousands where he would have hated to spend pennies; yet the

financial part of the loss hardly touched him. He mumbled fearfully to

himself, and took not the slightest interest in the half-hearted

attempts to read the mystery. When the others moved, he moved with them,

because he was afraid to be left alone.
After the men had assured themselves again and again that the horse and

the man had apparently materialized from thin air exactly at the point

of robbery, they again followed the tracks to the broad sheet of rock.

Whither had the robber gone? Back into the thin air whence he had come.

There was no other solution. No tracks ahead; an absolute and physical

impossibility of anything without wings getting up or down the flanking

precipices—these were the incontestable facts.
After this second robbery a gloom descended on Bright's Cove which

lasted through many months. Old Man Bright hunted out the squaw with

whom he had first discovered the diggings, and set her up in an

establishment with gay curtains, glass danglers and red doileys. Each

month he paid for her provisions and sent to her a sum of money. In this

manner, at least, the phantom road agent had furthered the ends of

justice. The sop to the powers of darkness appeared to be effective in

this respect: no more hold-ups occurred; no more mysterious tracks

appeared in the dust; gradually men's minds swung back to the bal[Pg 150]anced

and normal, and the life of the camp went forward on its appointed way.
Nevertheless, certain effects remained. Each express went out heavily

guarded, and preceded and followed by men on horseback. Strangely enough

the gamblers left camp. In a little more than a year Old Man Bright fell

into a settled melancholia from which his millions never helped him to

the very day of his death a little more than a year later.
In the meantime, however varied the fortunes of the other mines and

prospects, the Lost Dog continued to work toward a steadily increasing

paying basis. It never reached the proportions of the Clarice, but

turned out an increasing value of dust at each clean-up. The Gaynes boys

two years before had been in debt for their groceries. Now they were

said to have shipped out something like three or four hundred thousand

dollars' worth of gold. Their friends used to wander down for the

regular clean-up, just to rejoice over the youngsters' deserved good

luck. The little five stamp-mill crunched away steadily; the water

flowed; and in the riffles the heavy gold dust accumulated.
"Why don't you-all put up a big mill, throw in a crew of men, and get

busy?" they were asked.
"I'll tell you," replied George, "it's because we know a heap sight more

about mining than we did when we came here. We have just one claim, and

from all indications it's only a pocket. The Clarice is on a genuine

lode; but we're likely to run into a 'horse' or pinch out most any

minute. When we do, it's all over but a few faint cries of fraud. And we

can empty that pocket just as well with a little jerkwater outfit like

this as we could with a big crew and [Pg 151]a real mill. It'll take a little

longer; but we're pulling it and quick enough."
"Those Babes have more sense than we gave 'em credit for," commented

California John. "Their heads are level. They're dead right about it's

bein' a pocket. The stuff they run through there is the darndest mixture

I ever see gold in."
Two months after this conversation the Babes drifted into camp to

announce that the expected pinch had come.
"We're going," said Jimmy. "We have a heap plenty dust salted away; and

there's not a colour left in the Lost Dog. The mill machinery is for

sale cheap. Any one can have the Lost Dog who wants it. We're going out

to see what makes the wheels go 'round. You boys have a first claim on

us wherever you find us. You've sure been good to us. If you catch that

spook, send us one of his tail feathers. It would be worth just twelve

thousand five hundred to us."
They sold the stamp-mill for almost nothing; packed eight animals with

heavy things they had accumulated; and departed up the steep white road,

over the rim to the outer world whence came no word of them more. The

camp went on prospering. Old Man Bright died. The heavily guarded

express continued to drag out yellow gold by the hundredweight.
About six weeks after the departure of the Babes, California John

saddled up his best horse, put on his best overalls, strapped about him

his shiny worn Colt's .45 and departed for his semi-annual visit to the

valleys and the towns. [Pg 152]A week later he returned. It was about dusk. At

the water trough he dismounted.
"Boys," said he, quietly, "I've been held up." He eyed them quizzically.

"Up by the slide rock," he continued, "and by the spook."
"Who was he?" "What was it?" they cried, starting to their feet.
"It was Jimmy Gaynes," replied California John.
"The Babe?" someone broke the stunned silence at last.
"Precisely."
"Well, I'll be damned!" cried Tibbetts.
"Did he get much off you?" asked a miner after another pause.
"He never took a thing."
And on that, being much besieged, California John sat him down and told

of his experience.

[Pg 153]
CHAPTER III
California John was discursive and interested and disinclined to be

hurried. He crossed one leg over the other and lit his pipe.
"I was driftin' down the road busy with my own idees—which ain't many,"

he began, "when I was woke up all to once by someone givin' me advice. I

took the advice. Wasn't nothin' else to do. All I could see was a rock

and a gun barrel. That was enough. So I histed my hands as per commands

and waited for the next move." He chuckled. "I wasn't worryin'. Had to

squeeze my dust bag to pay my hotel bill when I left the city."
"'Drop yore gun in the road,' says the agent.
"I done so.
"'Now dismount.'
"I climbed down. And then Jimmy Gaynes rose up from behind that rock and

laughed at me.
"'The joke's on me!' said I, and reached down for my gun.
"'Better leave that!' said Jimmy pretty sharp. I know that tone of

voice, so I straightened up again.
"'Well, Jimmy,' said I, 'she lays if you say so. But where'd you come

from: and what for do you turn road agent and hold up your old friends?'
"'I'm holdin' you up,' Jimmy answered, 'because I want [Pg 154]to talk to you

for ten minutes. As for where I come from, that's neither here nor

there.'
"'Of course,' said I, 'I'm one of these exclusive guys that needs a gun

throwed on him before he'll talk with the plain people like you.'
"'Now don't get mad,' says Jimmy. 'But light yore pipe, and set down on

that rock, and you'll see in a minute why I preferred to corner the

gatling market.'
"Well, I set down and lit up, and Jimmy done likewise, about ten feet

away.
"'I've come back a long ways to talk to one of you boys, and I've shore

hung around this road some few hours waitin' for some of you terrapins

to come along. Ever found out who done those two hold-ups?'
"'Nope,' said I, 'and don't expect to.'
"'Well, I done it,' says he.
"I looked him in the eye mighty severe.
"'You're one of the funniest little jokers ever hit this trail,' I told

him. 'If that's your general line of talkee-talkee I don't wonder you

don't want me to have no gun.'
"'Nevertheless,' he insists, 'I done it. And I'll tell you just how it

was done. Here's yore old express crawlin' up the road. Here I am behind

this little old rock. You know what happened next I reckon—from

experience.'
"'I reckon I know that,' says I, 'but how did you get behind that rock

without leavin' no tracks?'
"I climbed up the cliff out of the cañon, and I just walked up the cañon

from the Lost Dog through the brush.'
"'Yes,' says I, 'that might be: a man could make out to shinny up. But

how——'
[Pg 155]"'One thing to a time. Then I ordered them dust sacks throwed out, and

the driver to 'bout-face and retreat.'
"'Sure,' says I, 'simple as a wart on a kid's nose. There was you with a

half ton of gold to fly off with! Come again.'
"'I then dropped them sacks off the edge of the cliff where they rolled

into the brush. After a while I climbed down after them, and was on hand

when your posse started out. Then I carried them home at leisure.'
"'What did you do with your hoss?' I asked him, mighty sarcastic. 'Seems

to me you overlook a few bets.'
"'I didn't have no hoss,' says he.
"'But the real hold-up——
"'You mean them tracks. Well, just to amuse you fellows, I walked in the

dust up to that flat rock. Then I clamped a big pair of horseshoes on

hind-side before and walked back again.'"
California John's audience had been listening intently. Now it could no

longer contain itself, but broke forth into exclamations indicative of

various emotions.
"That's why them front and back tracks was the same size!" someone

cried.
"Gee, you're bright!" said California John. "That's what I told him. I

also told him he was a wonder, but how did he manage to slip out near a

ton of dust up that road without our knowing it?
"'You did know it,' says he. 'Did you fellows really think there was any

gold-bearing ore in the Lost Dog? We just run that dust through the mill

along with a lot of worthless rock, and shipped it out open and above

board as our own mill run. There never was an ounce of dust come out [Pg 156]of

the Lost Dog, and there never will.' Then he give me back my

gun—emptied—we shook hands, and here I be."
After the next burst of astonishment had ebbed, and had been succeeded

by a rather general feeling of admiration, somebody asked California

John if Jimmy had come back solely for the purpose of clearing up the

mystery. California John had evidently been waiting for this question.

He arose and knocked the ashes from his pipe.
"Bring a candle," he requested the storekeeper, and led the way to the

abandoned Lost Dog. Into the tunnel he led them, to the very end. There

he paused, holding aloft his light. At his feet was a canvas which,

being removed, was found to cover neatly a number of heavy sacks.
"Here's our dust," said California John, "every ounce of it, he said. He

kept about six hundred thousand or so that belonged to Bright: but he

didn't take none of ours. He come back to tell me so."
The men crowded around for closer inspection.
"I wonder why he done that?" Tibbetts marvelled.
"I asked him that," replied California John, grimly, "He said his

conscience never would rest easy if he robbed us babes."
Tibbetts broke the ensuing silence.
"Was 'babes' the word he used?" he asked, softly.
"'Babes' was the word," said California John.

THE TIDE
A short story, say the writers of text books and the teachers of

sophomores, should deal with but a single episode. That dictum is

probably true; but it admits of wider interpretation than is generally

given it. The teller of tales, anxious to escape from restriction but

not avid of being cast into the outer darkness of the taboo, can in

self-justification become as technical as any lawyer. The phrase "a

single episode" is loosely worded. The rule does not specify an episode

in one man's life; it might be in the life of a family, or a state, or

even of a whole people. In that case the action might cover many lives.

It is a way out for those who have a story to tell, a limit to tell it

within, but who do not wish to embroil themselves too seriously with the

august Makers of the Rules.

CHAPTER I
The time was 1850, the place that long, soft, hot dry stretch of blasted

desolation known as the Humboldt Sink. The sun stared, the heat rose in

waves, the mirage shimmered, the dust devils of choking alkali whirled

aloft or sank in suffocation on the hot earth. Thus it had been since in

remote ages the last drop of the inland sea had risen into a brazen sky.

But this year had brought something new. [Pg 158]A track now led across the

desert. It had sunk deep into the alkali, and the soft edges had closed

over it like snow, so that the wheel marks and the hoof marks and the

prints of men's feet looked old. Almost in a straight line it led to the

west. Its perspective, dwindling to nothingness, corrected the deceit of

the clear air. Without it the cool, tall mountains looked very near. But

when the eye followed the trail to its vanishing, then, as though by

magic, the Ranges drew back, and before them denied dreadful forces of

toil, thirst, exhaustion, and despair. For the trail was marked. If the

wheel ruts had been obliterated, it could still have been easily

followed. Abandoned goods, furniture, stores, broken-down wagons,

bloated carcasses of oxen or horses, bones bleached white, rattling

mummies of dried skin, and an almost unbroken line of marked and

unmarked graves—like the rout of an army, like the spent wash of a wave

that had rolled westward—these in double rank defined the road.
The buzzards sailing aloft looked down on the Humboldt Sink as we would

look upon a relief map. Near the centre of the map a tiny cloud of white

dust crawled slowly forward. The buzzards stooped to poise above it.
Two ox wagons plodded along. A squirrel—were such a creature

possible—would have stirred disproportionately the light alkali dust;

the two heavy wagons and the shuffling feet of the beasts raised a

cloud. The fitful furnace draught carried this along at the slow pace of

the caravan, which could be seen only dimly, as through a dense fog.
The oxen were in distress. Evidently weakened by starvation, they were

proceeding only with the greatest [Pg 159]difficulty. Their tongues were out,

their legs spread, spasmodically their eyes rolled back to show the

whites, from time to time one or another of them uttered a strangled,

moaning bellow. They were white with the powdery dust, as were their

yokes, the wagons, and the men who plodded doggedly alongside. Finally,

they stopped. The dust eddied by; and the blasting sun fell upon them.
The driver of the leading team motioned to the other. They huddled in

the scanty shade alongside the first wagon. Both men were so powdered

and caked with alkali that their features were indistinguishable. Their

red-rimmed, inflamed eyes looked out as though from masks.
The one who had been bringing up the rear looked despairingly toward the

mountains.
"We'll never get there!" he cried.
"Not the way we are now," replied the other. "But I intend to get

there."
"How?"
"Leave your wagon, Jim; it's the heaviest. Put your team on here."
"But my wagon is all I've got in the world!" cried the other, "and we've

got near a keg of water yet! We can make it! The oxen are pulling all

right!"
His companion turned away with a shrug, then thought better of it and

turned back.
"We've thrown out all we owned except bare necessities," he explained,

patiently. "Your wagon is too heavy. The time to change is while the

beasts can still pull."
"But I refuse!" cried the other. "I won't do it. Go [Pg 160]ahead with your

wagon. I'll get mine in, John Gates, you can't bulldoze me."
Gates stared him in the eye.
"Get the pail," he requested, mildly.
He drew water from one of the kegs slung underneath the wagon's body.

The oxen, smelling it, strained weakly, bellowing. Gates slowly and

carefully swabbed out their mouths, permitted them each a few swallows,

rubbed them pityingly between the horns. Then he proceeded to unyoke the

four beasts from the other man's wagon and yoked them to his own. Jim

started to say something. Gates faced him. Nothing was said.
"Get your kit," Gates commanded, briefly, after a few moments. He parted

the hanging canvas and looked into the wagon. Built to transport much

freight it was nearly empty. A young woman lay on a bed spread along the

wagon bottom. She seemed very weak.
"All right, honey?" asked Gates, gently.
She stirred, and achieved a faint smile.
"It's terribly hot. The sun strikes through," she replied. "Can't we let

some air in?"
"The dust would smother you."
"Are we nearly there?"
"Getting on farther every minute," he replied, cheerfully.
Again the smothering alkali rose and the dust cloud crawled.
Four hours later the traveller called Jim collapsed face downward. The

oxen stopped. Gates lifted the man by the shoulders. So exhausted was he

that he had not the strength nor energy to spit forth the alkali with

which his [Pg 161]fall had caked his open mouth. Gates had recourse to the

water keg. After a little he hoisted his companion to the front seat.
At intervals thereafter the lone human figure spoke the single word that

brought his team to an instantaneous dead stop. His first care was then

the woman, next the man clinging to the front seat, then the oxen.

Before starting he clambered to the top of the wagon and cast a long,

calculating look across the desolation ahead. Twice he even further

reduced the meagre contents of the wagon, appraising each article long

and doubtfully before discarding it. About mid-afternoon he said

abruptly:
"Jim, you've got to walk."
The man demurred weakly, with a touch of panic.
"Every ounce counts. It's going to be a close shave. You can hang on to

the tail of the wagon."
Yet an hour later Jim, for the fourth time, fell face downward, but now

did not rise. Gates, going to him, laid his hand on his head, pushed

back one of his eyelids, then knelt for a full half minute, staring

straight ahead. Once he made a tentative motion toward the nearly empty

water keg, once he started to raise the man's shoulders. The movements

were inhibited. A brief agony cracked the mask of alkali on his

countenance. Then stolidly, wearily, he arose. The wagon lurched

forward. After it had gone a hundred yards and was well under way in its

painful forward crawl, Gates, his red-rimmed, bloodshot eyes fixed and

glazed, drew the revolver from its holster and went back.
At sundown he began to use the gad. The oxen were [Pg 162]trying to lie down.

If one of them succeeded, it would never again arise. Gates knew this.

He plied the long, heavy whip in both hands. Where the lash fell it bit

out strips of hide. It was characteristic of the man that though

heretofore he had not in all this day inflicted a single blow on the

suffering animals, though his nostrils widened and his terrible red eyes

looked for pity toward the skies, yet now he swung mercilessly with all

his strength.
Dusk fell, but the hot earth still radiated, the powder dust rose and

choked. The desert dragged at their feet; and in the twilight John Gates

thought to hear mutterings and the soft sound of wings overhead as the

dread spirits of the wastes stooped low. He had not stopped for nearly

two hours. This was the last push; he must go straight through or fail.
And when the gleam of the river answered the gleam of the starlight he

had again to rouse his drained energies. By the brake, by directing the

wagon into an obstruction, by voice and whip he fought the frantic

beasts back to a moaning standstill. Then pail by pail he fed them the

water until the danger of overdrinking was past. He parted the curtains.

In spite of the noise outside the woman, soothed by the breath of cooler

air, had fallen asleep.
Some time later he again parted the curtains.
"We're here, honey," he said, "good water, good grass, shade. The desert

is past. Wake up and take a little coffee."
She smiled at him.
"I'm so tired."
"We're going to rest here a spell."
[Pg 163]She drank the coffee, ate some of the food he brought her, thrust back

her hair, breathed deep of the cooling night.
"Where's Jim?" she asked at last.
"Jim got very tired," he said, "Jim's asleep."

Three months later. The western slant of the Sierras just where the

cañon clefts begin to spread into foothills. On a flat near—too

near—the stream-bed was a typical placer-mining camp of the day. That

is, three or four large, rough buildings in a row, twenty or thirty log

cabins scattered without order, and as many tents.
The whole population was gathered interestedly in the largest structure,

which was primarily a dance hall. Ninety-five per cent. were men, of

whom the majority were young men. A year ago the percentage would have

been nearer one hundred, but now a certain small coterie of women had

drifted in, most of them with a keen eye for prosperity. The red or blue

shirt, the nondescript hat, and the high, mud-caked boots of the miner

preponderated. Here and there in the crowd, however, stood a man dressed

in the height of fashion. There seemed no middle ground. These latter

were either the professional gamblers, the lawyers, or the promoters.
A trial was in progress, to which all paid deep attention. Two men

disputed the ownership of a certain claim. Their causes were represented

by ornate individuals whose evident zest in the legal battle was not

measured by prospective fees. Nowhere in the domain and at no time in

the history of the law has technicality been so valued, has the game of

the courts possessed such intellectual interest, has substantial

[Pg 164]justice been so uncertain as in the California of the early 'fifties.

The lawyer could spread himself unhampered; and these were so doing.
In the height of the proceedings a man entered from outside and took his

position leaning against the rail of the jury box. That he was a

stranger was evident from the glances of curiosity, cast in his

direction. He was tall, strong, young, bearded, with a roving, humorous

bold eye.
The last word was spoken. A rather bewildered-looking jury filed out.

Ensued a wait. The jury came back. It could not agree; it wanted

information. Both lawyers supplied it in abundance. The foreman, who

happened to be next the rail against which the newcomer was leaning,

cast on him a quizzical eye.
"Stranger," said he, "mout you be able to make head er tail of all that

air?"
The other shook his head.
"I'm plumb distracted to know what to do; and dear knows we all want to

git shet of this job. Thar's a badger fight——"
"Where is this claim, anyway?"
"Right adown the road. Location notice is on the first white oak you

come to. Cain't miss her."
"If I were you," said the stranger after a pause, "I'd just declare the

claim vacant. Then neither side would win."
At this moment the jury rose to retire again. The stranger unobtrusively

gained the attention of the clerk and from him begged a sheet of paper.

On this he wrote [Pg 165]rapidly, then folded it, and moved to the outer door,

against the jamb of which he took his position. After another and

shorter wait, the jury returned.
"Have you agreed on your verdict, gentlemen?" inquired the judge.
"We have," replied the lank foreman. "We award that the claim belongs to

neither and be declared vacant."
At the words the stranger in the doorway disappeared. Two minutes later

the advance guard of the rush that had comprehended the true meaning of

the verdict found the white oak tree in possession of a competent

individual with a Colt's revolving pistol and a humorous eye.
"My location notice, gentlemen," he said, calling attention to a paper

freshly attached by wooden pegs.
"Honey-bug claim'," they read, "'John Gates'," and the usual

phraseology.
"But this is a swindle, an outrage!" cried one of the erstwhile owners.
"If so it was perpetrated by your own courts," said Gates, crisply. "I

am within my rights, and I propose to defend them."
Thus John Gates and his wife, now strong and hearty, became members of

this community. His intention had been to proceed to Sacramento. An

incident stopped him here.
The Honey-bug claim might or might not be a good placer mine—time would

show—but it was certainly a wonderful location. Below the sloping bench

on which it stood the country fell away into the brown heat haze of the

lowlands, a curtain that could lift before a north wind to reveal a

landscape magnificent as a kingdom. [Pg 166]Spreading white oaks gave shade, a

spring sang from the side hill on which grew lofty pines, and back to

the east rose the dark or glittering Sierras. The meadow at the back was

gay with mariposa lilies, melodious with bees and birds, aromatic with

the mingled essences of tarweed, lads-love, and the pines. At this happy

elevation the sun lay warm and caressing, but the air tasted cool.
"I could love this," said the woman.
"You'll have a chance," said John Gates, "for when we've made our pile,

we'll always keep this to come back to."
At first they lived in the wagon, which they drew up under one of the

trees, while the oxen recuperated and grew fat on the abundant grasses.

Then in spare moments John Gates began the construction of a house. He

was a man of tremendous energy, but also of many activities. The days

were not long enough for him. In him was the true ferment of

constructive civilization. Instinctively he reached out to modify his

surroundings. A house, then a picket fence, split from the living trees;

an irrigation ditch; a garden spot; fruit trees; vines over the porch;

better stables; more fences; the gradual shaping from the wilderness of

a home—these absorbed his surplus. As a matter of business he worked

with pick and shovel until he had proved the Honey-bug hopeless, then he

started a store on credit. Therein he sold everything from hats to 42

calibre whiskey. To it he brought the same overflowing play-spirit that

had fashioned his home.
"I'm making a very good living," he answered a question; "that is, if

I'm not particular on how well I live," and he laughed his huge laugh.
[Pg 167]He was very popular. Shortly they elected him sheriff. He gained this

high office fundamentally, of course, by reason of his courage and

decision of character; but the immediate and visible causes were the

Episode of the Frazzled Mule, and the Episode of the Frying Pan. The one

inspired respect; the other amusement.
The freight company used many pack and draught animals. One day one of

its mules died. The mozo in charge of the corrals dragged the carcass

to the superintendent's office. That individual cursed twice; once at

the mule for dying, and once at the mozo for being a fool. At

nightfall another mule died. This time the mozo, mindful of his

berating, did not deliver the body, but conducted the superintendent to

see the sad remains.
"Bury it," ordered the superintendent, disgustedly. Two mules at

$350—quite a loss.
But next morning another had died; fairly an epidemic among mules. This

carcass also was ordered buried. And at noon a fourth. The

superintendent, on his way to view the defunct, ran across John Gates.
"Look here, John," queried he, "do you know anything about mules?"
"Considerable," admitted Gates.
"Well, come see if you can tell me what's killing ours off."
They contemplated the latest victim of the epidemic.
"Seems to be something that swells them up," ventured the superintendent

after a while.
John Gates said nothing for some time. Then suddenly he snatched his

pistol and levelled it at the shrinking mozo.
[Pg 168]"Produce those three mules!" he roared, "mucho pronto, too!" To the

bewildered superintendent he explained. "Don't you see? this is the same

old original mule. He ain't never been buried at all. They've been

stealing your animals pretending they died, and using this one over and

over as proof!"
This proved to be the case; but John Gates was clever enough never to

tell how he surmised the truth.
"That mule looked to me pretty frazzled," was all he would say.
The frying-pan episode was the sequence of a quarrel. Gates was bringing

home a new frying pan. At the proper point in the discussion he used his

great strength to smash the implement over his opponent's head so

vigorously that it came down around his neck like a jagged collar! Gates

clung to the handle, however, and by it led his man all around camp, to

the huge delight of the populace.
As sheriff he was effective, but at times peculiar in his

administration. No man could have been more zealous in performing his

duty; yet he never would mix in the affairs of foreigners. Invariably in

such cases he made out the warrants in blank, swore in the complaining

parties themselves as deputies, and told them blandly to do their own

arresting! Nor at times did he fail to temper his duty with a little

substantial justice of his own. Thus he was once called upon to execute

a judgment for $30 against a poor family. Gates went down to the

premises, looked over the situation, talked to the man—a

poverty-stricken, discouraged, ague-shaken creature—and marched back to

the offices of the plaintiffs in the case.
[Pg 169]"Here," said he, calmly, laying a paper and a small bag of gold dust on

their table, "is $30 and a receipt in full."
The complainant reached for the sack. Gates placed his hand over it.
"Sign the receipt," he commanded. "Now," he went on after the ink had

been sanded, "there's your $30. It's yours legally; and you can take it

if you want to. But I want to warn you that a thousand-dollar licking

goes with it!"
The money—from Gates's own pocket—eventually found its way to the poor

family!
They had three children, two boys and a girl of which one boy died.
In five years the placers began to play out. One by one the more

energetic of the miners dropped away. The nature of the community

changed. Small hill ranches or fruit farms took the place of the mines.

The camp became a country village. Old time excitement calmed, the pace

of life slowed, the horizon narrowed.
John Gates, clear-eyed, energetic, keen brained, saw this tendency

before it became a fact.
"This camp is busted," he told himself.
It was the hour to fulfill the purpose of the long, terrible journey

across the plains, to carry out the original intention to descend from

the Sierras to the golden valleys, to follow the struggle.
"Reckon it's time to be moving," he told his wife.
But now his own great labours asserted their claim. He had put four

years of his life into making this farm out of nothing, four years of

incredible toil, energy, and young [Pg 170]enthusiasm. He had a good dwelling

and spacious corrals, an orchard started, a truck garden, a barley

field, a pasture, cattle, sheep, chickens, his horses—all his creation

from nothing. One evening at sundown he found his wife in the garden

weeping softly.
"What is it, honey?" he asked.
"I was just thinking how we'd miss the garden," she replied.
He looked about at the bright, cheerful flowers, the vine-hung picket

fence, the cool verandah, the shady fig tree already of some size.

Everything was neat and trim, just as he liked it. And the tinkle of

pleasant waters, the song of a meadow lark, the distant mellow lowing of

cows came to his ears; the smell of tarweed and of pines mingled in his

nostrils.
"It's a good place for children," he said, vaguely.
Neither knew it, but that little speech marked the ebb of the wave that

had lifted him from his eastern home, had urged him across the plains,

had flung him in the almost insolent triumph of his youth high toward

the sun. Now the wash receded.

[Pg 171]
CHAPTER II
It was indeed a good place for children. Charley and Alice Gates grew

tall and strong, big boned, magnificent, typical California products.

They went to the district school, rode in the mountains, helped handle

the wild cattle. At the age of twelve Charley began to accompany the

summer incursions into the High Sierras in search of feed. At the age of

sixteen he was entrusted with a bunch of cattle. In these summers he

learned the wonder of the high, glittering peaks, the blueness of the

skies in high altitudes, the multitude of the stars, the flower-gemmed

secret meadows, the dark, murmuring forests. He fished in the streams,

and hunted on the ridges. His camp was pitched within a corral of heavy

logs. It was very simple. Utensils depending from trees, beds beneath

canvas tarpaulins on pine needles, saddlery, riatas, branding irons

scattered about. No shelter but the sky. A wonderful roving life.
It developed taciturnity and individualism. Charley Gates felt no

necessity for expression as yet; and as his work required little

coöperation from his fellow creatures he acknowledged as little

responsibility toward them. Thus far he was the typical mountaineer.
But other influences came to him; as, indeed, they come to all. But

young Charley was more susceptible than most, and this—on the impulse

of the next tide resurgent—[Pg 172]saved him from his type. He liked to read;

he did not scorn utterly and boisterously the unfortunate young man who

taught the school; and, better than all, he possessed just the

questioning mind that refuses to accept on their own asseveration only

the conventions of life or the opinions of neighbours. If he were to

drink, it would be because he wanted to; not because his companions

considered it manly. If he were to enter the sheep war, it would be

because he really considered sheep harmful to the range; not because of

the overwhelming—and contagious—prejudice.
In one thing only did he follow blindly his sense of loyalty: He hated

the Hydraulic Company.
Years after the placers failed someone discovered that the wholesale use

of hydraulic "giants" produced gold in paying quantities. Huge streams

of water under high pressure were directed against the hills, which

melted like snow under the spring sun. The earth in suspension was run

over artificial riffles against which the heavier gold collected. One

such stream could accomplish in a few hours what would have cost hand

miners the better part of a season.
But the débris must go somewhere. A rushing mud and boulder-filled

torrent tore down stream beds adapted to a tenth of their volume. It

wrecked much of the country below, ripping out the good soil, covering

the bottomlands many feet deep with coarse rubble, clay, mud, and even

big rocks and boulders. The farmers situated below such operations

suffered cruelly. Even to this day the devastating results may be seen

above Colfax or Sacramento.
John Gates suffered with the rest. His was not the [Pg 173]nature to submit

tamely, nor to compromise. He had made his farm with his own hands, and

he did not propose to see it destroyed. Much money he expended through

the courts; indeed the profits of his business were eaten by a

never-ending, inconclusive suit. The Hydraulic Company, securely

entrenched behind the barriers of especial privilege, could laugh at his

frontal attacks. It was useless to think of force. The feud degenerated

into a bitter legal battle and much petty guerrilla warfare on both

sides.
To this quarrel Charley had been bred up in a consuming hate of the

Hydraulic Company, all its works, officers, bosses, and employees. Every

human being in any way connected with it wore horns, hoofs, and a tail.

In company with the wild youths of the neighbourhood he perpetrated many

a raid on the Company's property. Beginning with boyish openings of

corrals to permit stock to stray, these raids progressed with the years

until they had nearly arrived at the dignity of armed deputies and bench

warrants.
The next day of significance to our story was October 15, 1872. On that

date fire started near Flour Gold and swept upward. October is always a

bad time of year for fires in foothill California—between the rains,

the heat of the year, everything crisp and brown and brittle. This

threatened the whole valley and water shed. The Gateses turned out, and

all their neighbours, with hoe, mattock, axe, and sacking, trying to

beat, cut, or scrape a "break" wide enough to check the flames. It was

cruel work. The sun blazed overhead and the earth underfoot. The air

quivered as from a furnace. Men gasped at it with strain[Pg 174]ing lungs. The

sweat pouring from their bodies combined with the parching of the

superheated air induced a raging thirst. No water was to be had save

what was brought to them. Young boys and women rode along the line

carrying canteens, water bottles, and food. The fire fighters snatched

hastily at these, for the attack of the fire permitted no respite. Twice

they cut the wide swath across country; but twice before it was

completed the fire crept through and roared into triumph behind them.

The third time the line held, and this was well into the second day.
Charley Gates had fought doggedly. He had summoned the splendid

resources of youth and heritage, and they had responded. Next in line to

his right had been a stranger. This latter was a slender, clean-cut

youth, at first glance seemingly of delicate physique. Charley had

looked upon him with the pitying contempt of strong youth for weak

youth. He considered that the stranger's hands were soft and effeminate,

he disliked his little trimmed moustache, and especially the cool,

mocking, appraising glance of his eyes. But as the day, and the night,

and the day following wore away, Charley raised his opinion. The slender

body possessed unexpected reserve, the long, lean hands plied the tools

unweariedly, the sensitive face had become drawn and tired, but the

spirit behind the mocking eyes had not lost the flash of its defiance.

In the heat of the struggle was opportunity for only the briefest

exchanges. Once, when Charley despairingly shook his empty canteen, the

stranger offered him a swallow from his own. Next time exigency crowded

them together, Charley croaked:
"Reckon we'll hold her."
[Pg 175]Toward evening of the second day the westerly breeze died, and shortly

there breathed a gentle air from the mountains. The danger was past.
Charley and the stranger took long pulls from their recently replenished

canteens. Then they sank down where they were, and fell instantly

asleep. The projecting root of a buckthorn stuck squarely into Charley's

ribs, but he did not know it; a column of marching ants, led by a

non-adaptable commander, climbed up and over the recumbent form of the

stranger, but he did not care.
They came to life in the shiver of gray dawn, wearied, stiffened, their

eyes swelled, their mouths dry.
"You're a sweet sight, stranger," observed Charley.
"Same to you and more of 'em," rejoined the other.
Charley arose painfully.
"There's a little water in my canteen yet," he proffered. "What might

you call yourself? I don't seem to know you in these parts."
"Thanks," replied the other. "My name's Cathcart; I'm from just above."
He drank, and lowered the canteen to look into the flaming, bloodshot

eyes of his companion.
"Are you the low-lived skunk that's running the Hydraulic Company?"

demanded Charley Gates.
The stranger laid down the canteen and scrambled painfully to his feet.
"I am employed by the Company," he replied, curtly, "but please to

understand I don't permit you to call me names."
"Permit!" sneered Charley.
[Pg 176]"Permit," repeated Cathcart.
So, not having had enough exercise in the past two days, these young

game cocks went at each other. Charley was much the stronger

rough-and-tumble fighter; but Cathcart possessed some boxing skill.

Result was that, in their weakened condition, they speedily fought

themselves to a standstill without serious damage to either side.
"Now perhaps you'll tell me who the hell you think you are!" panted

Cathcart, fiercely.
At just beyond arm's length they discussed the situation, at first

belligerently with much recrimination, then more calmly, at last with a

modicum of mutual understanding. Neither seceded from his basic opinion.

Charley Gates maintained that the Company had no earthly business

ruining his property, but admitted that with all that good gold lying

there it was a pity not to get it out. Cathcart stoutly defended a man's

perfect right to do as he pleased with his own belongings, but conceded

that something really ought to be done about overflow waters.
"What are you doing down here fighting fire, anyway?" demanded Charley,

suddenly. "It couldn't hurt your property. You could turn the 'giants'

on it, if it ever came up your way."
"I don't know. I just thought I ought to help out a little," said

Cathcart, simply.
For three years more Charley ran his father's cattle in the hills. Then

he announced his intention of going away. John Gates was thunderstruck.

By now he was stranded high and dry above the tide, fitting perfectly

his surroundings. Vaguely he had felt that his son would [Pg 177]stay with him

always. But the wave was again surging upward. Charley had talked with

Cathcart.
"This is no country to draw a salary in," the latter had told him, "nor

to play with farming or cows. It's too big, too new, there are too many

opportunities. I'll resign, and you leave; and we'll make our fortunes."
"How?" asked Charley.
"Timber," said Cathcart.
They conferred on this point. Cathcart had the experience of business

ways; Charley Gates the intimate knowledge of the country; there only

needed a third member to furnish some money. Charley broke the news to

his family, packed his few belongings, and the two of them went to San

Francisco.
Charley had never seen a big city. He was very funny about it, but not

overwhelmed. While willing, even avid, to go the rounds and meet the

sporting element, he declined to drink. When pressed and badgered by his

new acquaintances, he grinned amiably.
"I never play the other fellows' game," he said. "When it gets to be my

game, I'll join you."
The new partners had difficulty in getting even a hearing.
"It's a small business," said capitalists, "and will be. The demand for

lumber here is limited, and it is well taken care of by small concerns

near at hand."
"The state will grow and I am counting on the outside market," argued

Cathcart.
But this was too absurd! The forests of Michigan, Wisconsin, and

Minnesota were inexhaustible! As for the [Pg 178]state growing to that extent;

of course we all believe it, but when it comes to investing good money

in the belief——
At length they came upon one of the new millionaires created by the

bonanzas of Virginia City.
"I don't know a damn thing about your timber, byes," said he, "but I

like your looks. I'll go in wid ye. Have a seegar; they cost me a dollar

apiece."
The sum invested was absurdly, inadequately small.
"It'll have to spread as thin as it can," said Cathcart.
They spent the entire season camping in the mountains. By the end of the

summer they knew what they wanted; and immediately took steps to acquire

it. Under the homestead laws each was entitled to but a small tract of

Government land. However, they hired men to exercise their privileges in

this respect, to take up each his allotted portion, and then to convey

his rights to Cathcart and Gates. It was slow business, for the show of

compliance with Government regulations had to be made. But in this

manner the sum of money at their disposal was indeed spread out very

thin.
For many years the small, nibbling lumbering operations their limited

capital permitted supplied only a little more than a bare living and the

taxes. But every available cent went back into the business. It grew.

Band saws replaced the old circulars; the new mills delivered their

product into flumes that carried it forty miles to the railroad. The

construction of this flume was a tremendous undertaking, but by now the

firm could borrow on its timber. To get the water necessary to keep the

flume in operation the partners—again by means of "dummies"—filed on

the water rights of certain streams. To take up the water [Pg 179]directly was

without the law; but a show of mineral stain was held to justify a

"mineral claim," so patents were obtained under that ruling. Then

Charley had a bright idea.
"Look here, Cliff," he said to Cathcart. "I know something about

farming; I was brought up on a farm. This country will grow anything

anywhere if it has water. That lower country they call a desert, but

that's only because it hasn't any rainfall. We're going to have a lot of

water at the end of that flume——"
They bought the desert land at fifty cents an acre; scraped ditches and

checks; planted a model orchard, and went into the real estate business.

In time a community grew up. When hydro-electric power came into its own

Cathcart & Gates from their various water rights furnished light for

themselves, and gradually for the towns and villages round-about. Thus

their affairs spread and became complicated. Before they knew it they

were wealthy, very wealthy. Their wives—for in due course each had his

romance—began to talk of San Francisco.
All this had not come about easily. At first they had to fight tooth and

nail. The conditions of the times were crude, the code merciless. As

soon as the firm showed its head above the financial horizon, it was

swooped upon. Business was predatory. They had to fight for what they

got; had to fight harder to hold it. Cathcart was involved continually

in a maze of intricate banking transactions; Gates resisted aggression

within and without, often with his own two fists. They learned to trust

no man, but they learned also to hate no man. It was all part of the

game. [Pg 180]More sensitive temperaments would have failed; these succeeded.

Cathcart became shrewd, incisive, direct, cold, a little hard; Charley

Gates was burly, hearty, a trifle bullying. Both were in all

circumstances quite unruffled; and in some circumstances ruthless.
About 1900 the entire holdings of the Company were capitalized, and a

stock company was formed. The actual management of the lumbering, the

conduct of the farms and ranches, the running of the hydro-electric

systems of light and transportation, were placed in the hands of active

young men. Charley Gates and his partner exercised over these activities

only the slightest supervision; auditing accounts, making an occasional

trip of inspection. Affairs would quite well have gone on without them;

though they would have disbelieved and resented that statement.
The great central offices in San Francisco were very busy—all but the

inner rooms where stood the partners' desks. One day Cathcart lit a

fresh cigar, and slowly wheeled his chair.
"Look here, Charley," he proposed, "we've got a big surplus. There's no

reason why we shouldn't make a killing on the side."
"As how?" asked Gates.
Cathcart outlined his plan. It was simply stock manipulation on a big

scale; although the naked import was somewhat obscured by the

complications of the scheme. After he had finished Gates smoked for some

time in silence.
"All right, Cliff," said he, "let's do it."
And so by a sentence, as his father before him, he marked the farthest

throw of the wave that had borne him blindly [Pg 181]toward the shore. In the

next ten years Cathcart and Gates made forty million dollars. Charley

seemed to himself to be doing a tremendous business, but his real work,

his contribution to the episode in the life of the commonwealth, ceased

there. Again the wave receded.

[Pg 182]
CHAPTER III
The third generation of the Gates family consisted of two girls and a

boy. They were brought up as to their early childhood in what may be

called moderate circumstances. A small home near the little mill town, a

single Chinese servant, a setter dog, and plenty of horses formed their

entourage. When Charles, Jr., was eleven, and his sisters six and eight,

however, the family moved to a pretentious "mansion" on Nob Hill in San

Francisco. The environment of childhood became a memory: the reality of

life was comprised in the super-luxurious existence on Nob Hill.
It was not a particularly wise existence. Whims were too easily

realized, consequences too lightly avoided, discipline too capricious.

The children were sent to private schools where they met only their own

kind; they were specifically forbidden to mingle with the "hoodlums" in

the next street; they became accustomed to being sent here and there in

carriages with two servants, or later, in motor cars; they had always

spending money for the asking.
"I know what it is like to scrimp and save, and my children are going to

be spared that!" was Mrs. Gates's creed in the matter.
The little girls were always dressed alike in elaborately [Pg 183]simple

clothes, with frilly, starched underpinnies, silk stockings, high boots

buttoned up slim legs; and across their shoulders, from beneath

wonderful lingerie hats, hung shining curls. The latter were not

natural, but had each day to be elaborately constructed. They made a

dainty and charming picture.
"Did you ever see anything so sweet in all your life!" was the

invariable feminine exclamation.
Clara and Ethel-May always heard these remarks. They conducted

themselves with the poise and savoir faire of grown women. Before they

were twelve they could "handle" servants, conduct polite conversations

in a correctly artificial accent, and adapt their manners to another's

station in life.
Charley Junior's development was sharply divided into two periods, with

the second of which alone we have to do. The first, briefly, was

repressive. He was not allowed to play with certain boys, he was not

permitted to stray beyond certain bounds, he was kept clean and

dressed-up, he was taught his manners. In short, Mrs. Gates

tried—without knowing what she was doing—to use the same formula on

him as she had on Ethel-May and Clara.
In the second period, he was a grief to his family. Roughly speaking,

this period commenced about the time he began to be known as "Chuck"

instead of Charley.
There was no real harm in the boy. He was high spirited, full of life,

strong as a horse, and curious. Possessed of the patrician haughty good

looks we breed so easily from shirtsleeves, free with his money, known

as the son of his [Pg 184]powerful father, a good boxer, knowing no fear, he

speedily became a familiar popular figure around town. It delighted him

to play the prince, either incognito or in person; to "blow off the

crowd," to battle joyously with longshoremen; to "rough house" the

semi-respectable restaurants. The Barbary Coast knew him, Taits,

Zinkands, the Poodle Dog, the Cliff House, Franks, and many other

resorts not to be spoken of so openly. He even got into the police

courts once or twice; and nonchalantly paid a fine, with a joke at the

judge and a tip to the policeman who had arrested him. There was too

much drinking, too much gambling, too loose a companionship, altogether

too much spending; but in this case the life was redeemed from its usual

significance by a fantastic spirit of play, a generosity of soul, a

regard for the unfortunate, a courtliness toward all the world, a

refusal to believe in meanness or sordidness or cruelty. Chuck Gates was

inbred with the spirit of noblesse oblige.
As soon as motor cars came in Chuck had the raciest possible. With it he

managed to frighten a good many people half out of their wits. He had no

accidents, partly because he was a very good heady driver, and partly

because those whom he encountered were quick witted. One day while

touring in the south he came down grade around a bend squarely upon a

car ascending. Chuck's car was going too fast to be stopped. He tried

desperately to wrench it from the road, but perceived at once that this

was impossible without a fatal skid. Fortunately the only turnout for a

half mile happened to be just at that spot. The other man managed to

jump his car out on this little [Pg 185]side ledge and to jam on his brakes at

the very brink, just as Chuck flashed by. His mud guards slipped under

those at the rear of the other car.
"Close," observed Chuck to Joe Merrill his companion, "I was going a

little too fast," and thought no more of it.
But the other man, being angry, turned around and followed him into

town. At the garage he sought Chuck out.
"Didn't you pass me on the grade five miles back?" he inquired.
"I may have done so," replied Chuck, courteously.
"Don't you realize that you were going altogether too fast for a

mountain grade? that you were completely out of control?"
"I'm afraid I'll have to admit that that is so."
"Well," said the other man, with difficulty suppressing his anger. "What

do you suppose would have happened if I hadn't just been able to pull

out?"
"Why," replied Chuck, blandly, "I suppose I'd have had to pay heavily;

that's all."
"Pay!" cried the man, then checked himself with an effort, "so you

imagine you are privileged to the road, do whatever damage you

please—and pay! I'll just take your number."
"That is unnecessary. My name is Charles Gates," replied Chuck, "of San

Francisco."
The man appeared never to have heard of this potent cognomen. A month

later the trial came off. It was most inconvenient. Chuck was in Oregon,

hunting. He had to travel many hundreds of miles, to pay an expensive

[Pg 186]lawyer. In the end he was fined. The whole affair disgusted him, but he

went through with it well, testified without attempt at evasion. It was

a pity; but evidently the other man was no gentleman.
"I acknowledged I was wrong," he told Joe Merrill. He honestly felt that

this would have been sufficient had the cases been reversed. In answer

to a question as to whether he considered it fair to place the burden of

safety on the other man, he replied:
"Among motorists it is customary to exchange the courtesies of the

road—and sometimes the discourtesies," he added with a faint scorn.
The earthquake and fire of 1906 caught him in town. During three days

and nights he ran his car for the benefit of the sufferers; going

practically without food or sleep, exercising the utmost audacity and

ingenuity in getting supplies, running fearlessly many dangers.
For the rest he played polo well, shot excellently at the traps, was

good at tennis, golf, bridge. Naturally he belonged to the best clubs

both city and country. He sailed a yacht expertly, was a keen fisherman,

hunted. Also he played poker a good deal and was noted for his accurate

taste in dress.
His mother firmly believed that he caused her much sorrow; his sisters

looked up to him with a little awe; his father down on him with a

fiercely tolerant contempt.
For Chuck had had his turn in the offices. His mind was a good one; his

education both formal and informal, had trained it fairly well; yet he

could not quite make good. Energetic, ambitious, keen young men,

clambering upward [Pg 187]from the ruck, gave him points at the game and then

beat him. It was humiliating to the old man. He could not see the

perfectly normal reason. These young men were striving keenly for what

they had never had. Chuck was asked merely to add to what he already had

more than enough of by means of a game that itself did not interest him.
Late one evening Chuck and some friends were dining at the Cliff House.

They had been cruising up toward Tomales Bay, and had had themselves put

ashore here. No one knew of their whereabouts. Thus it was that Chuck

first learned of his father's death from apoplexy in the scareheads of

an evening paper handed him by the majordomo. He read the article

through carefully, then went alone to the beach below. It had been the

usual sensational article; and but two sentences clung to Chuck's

memory: "This fortunate young man's income will actually amount to about

ten dollars a minute. What a significance have now his days—and

nights!"
He looked out to sea whence the waves, in ordered rank, cast themselves

on the shore, seethed upward along the sands, poised, and receded. His

thoughts were many, but they always returned to the same point. Ten

dollars a minute—roughly speaking, seven thousand a day! What would he

do with it? "What a significance have now his days—and nights!"
His best friend, Joe Merrill, came down the path to him, and stood

silently by his side.
"I'm sorry about your governor, old man," he ventured; and then, after a

long time:
[Pg 188]"You're the richest man in the West."
Chuck Gates arose. A wave larger than the rest thundered and ran hissing

up to their feet.
"I wonder if the tide is coming in or going out," said Chuck, vaguely.


[Pg 189]ToC
CLIMBING FOR GOATS

CHAPTER I
Near the point at which the great Continental Divide of the Rocky

Mountains crosses the Canadian border another range edges in toward it

from the south. Between these ranges lies a space of from twenty to

forty miles; and midway between them flows a clear, wonderful river

through dense forests. Into the river empty other, tributary, rivers

rising in the bleak and lofty fastnesses of the mountains to right and

left. Between them, in turn, run spur systems of mountains only a little

less lofty than the parent ranges. Thus the ground plan of the whole

country is a good deal like that of a leaf: the main stem representing

the big river, the lateral veins its affluents; the tiny veins its

torrents pouring from the sides of its mountains and glaciers; and the

edges of the leaf and all spaces standing for mountains rising very

sheer and abrupt from the floor of the densely forested stream valleys.

In this country of forty miles by five hundred, then, are hundreds of

distinct ranges, thousands of peaks, and innumerable valleys, pockets,

and "parks." A wilder, lonelier, grander country would be hard to find.

Save for the Forest Service and a handful of fur trappers, it is

uninhabited. Its streams abound in trout; its dense forests with elk

[Pg 190]and white-tailed deer; its balder hills with blacktail deer; its upper

basins with grizzly bears; its higher country with sheep and that dizzy

climber the Rocky Mountain goat.
He who would enter this region descends at a little station on the Great

Northern, and thence proceeds by pack train at least four days,

preferably more, out into the wilderness. The going is through forests,

the tree trunks straight and very close together, so that he will see

very little of the open sky and less of the landscape. By way of

compensation the forest itself is remarkably beautiful. Its undergrowth,

though dense, is very low and even, not more than a foot or so off the

ground; and in the Hunting Moon the leaves of this undergrowth have

turned to purest yellow, without touch or trace of red, so that the

sombre forest is carpeted with gold. Here and there shows a birch or

aspen, also bright, pure light yellow, as though a brilliant sun were

striking down through painted windows. Groups of yellow-leafed larches

add to the splendour. And close to the ground grow little flat plants

decked out with red or blue or white wax berries, Christmas fashion.
In this green-and-gold room one journeys for days. Occasionally a chance

opening affords a momentary glimpse of hills or of the river sweeping

below; but not for long. It is a chilly room. The frost has hardened the

mud in the trail. One's feet and hands ache cruelly. At night camp is

made near the banks of the river, whence always one may in a few moments

catch as many trout as are needed, fine, big, fighting trout.
By the end of three or four days the prospect opens out. [Pg 191]Tremendous

cliffs rise sheer from the bottom of the valley; up tributary cañons one

can see a dozen miles to distant snow ranges glittering and wonderful.

Nearer at hand the mountains rise above timber line to great buttes and

precipices.

[Pg 192]
CHAPTER II
THE FIRST CLIMB
Fisher, Frank, and I had been hunting for elk in the dense forests along

the foot of one of these mountains; and for a half day, drenched with

sweat, had toiled continuously up and down steep slopes, trying to go

quietly, trying to keep our wind, trying to pierce the secrets of the

leafy screen always about us. We were tired of it.
"Let's go to the top and look for goats," suggested Frank. "There are

some goat cliffs on the other side of her. It isn't very far."
It was not very far, as measured by the main ranges, but it was a two

hours' steady climb nearly straight up. We would toil doggedly for a

hundred feet, or until our wind gave out and our hearts began to pound

distressingly; then we would rest a moment. After doing this a few

hundred times we would venture a look upward, confidently expecting the

summit to be close at hand. It seemed as far as ever. We suffered a

dozen or so of these disappointments, and then learned not to look up.

This was only after we had risen above timber line to the smooth,

rounded rock-and-grass shoulder of the mountain. Then three times we

made what we thought was a last spurt, only to find ourselves on a

"false summit." After a while we grew resigned, we realized that we were

never going to get anywhere, but [Pg 193]were to go on forever, without

ultimate purpose and without hope, pushing with tired legs, gasping with

inadequate lungs. When we had fully made up our minds to that, we

arrived. This is typical of all high-mountain climbing—the dogged,

hard, hopeless work that can never reach an accomplishment; and then at

last the sudden, unexpected culmination.
We topped a gently rounding summit; took several deep breaths into the

uttermost cells of our distressed lungs; walked forward a dozen

steps—and found ourselves looking over the sheer brink of a precipice.

So startlingly unforeseen was the swoop into blue space that I recoiled

hastily, feeling a little dizzy. Then I recovered and stepped forward

cautiously for another look. As with all sheer precipices, the lip on

which we stood seemed slightly to overhang, so that in order to see one

had apparently to crane away over, quite off balance. Only by the

strongest effort of the will is one able to rid oneself of the notion

that the centre of gravity is about to plunge one off head first into

blue space. For it was fairly blue space below our precipice. We could

see birds wheeling below us; and then below them again, very tiny, the

fall away of talus, and the tops of trees in the basin below. And

opposite, and all around, even down over the horizon, were other

majestic peaks, peers of our own, naked and rugged. From camp the great

forests had seemed to us the most important, most dominant, most

pervading feature of the wilderness. Now in the high sisterhood of the

peaks we saw they were as mantles that had been dropped about the feet.
Across the face of the cliff below us ran irregular tiny [Pg 194]ledges;

buttresses ended in narrow peaks; "chimneys" ran down irregularly to the

talus. Here were supposed to dwell the goats.
We proceeded along the crest, spying eagerly. We saw tracks; but no

animals. By now it was four o'clock, and past time to turn campward. We

struck down the mountain on a diagonal that should take us home. For

some distance all went well enough. To be sure, it was very steep, and

we had to pay due attention to balance and sliding. Then a rock wall

barred our way. It was not a very large rock wall. We went below it.

After a hundred yards we struck another. By now the first had risen

until it towered far above us, a sheer, gray cliff behind which the sky

was very blue. We skirted the base of the second and lower cliff. It led

us to another; and to still another. Each of these we passed on the

talus beneath it; but with increasing difficulty, owing to the fact that

the wide ledges were pinching out. At last we found ourselves cut off

from farther progress. To our right rose tier after tier of great

cliffs, serenely and loftily unconscious of any little insects like

ourselves that might be puttering around their feet. Straight ahead the

ledge ceased to exist. To our left was a hundred-foot drop to the talus

that sloped down to the cañon. The cañon did not look so very far away,

and we desired mightily to reach it. The only alternative to getting

straight down was to climb back the weary way we had come; and that

meant all night without food, warm clothing, or shelter on a

snow-and-ice mountain.
Therefore, we scouted that hundred-foot drop to our left [Pg 195]very

carefully. It seemed hopeless; but at last I found a place where a point

of the talus ran up to a level not much below our own. The only

difficulty was that between ourselves and that point of talus extended a

piece of sheer wall. I slung my rifle over my back, and gave myself to a

serious consideration of that wall. Then I began to work out across its

face.
The principle of safe climbing is to maintain always three points of

suspension: that it to say, one should keep either both footholds and

one handhold, or both handholds and one foothold. Failing that, one is

taking long chances. With this firmly in mind, I spidered out across the

wall, testing every projection and cranny before I trusted any weight to

it. One apparently solid projection as big as my head came away at the

first touch, and went bouncing off into space. Finally I stood, or

rather sprawled, almost within arm's length of a tiny scrub pine growing

solidly in a crevice just over the talus. Once there, our troubles were

over; but there seemed no way of crossing. For the moment it actually

looked as though four feet only would be sufficient to turn us back.
At last, however, I found a toehold half way across. It was a very

slight crevice, and not more than two inches deep. The toe of a boot

would just hold there without slipping. Unfortunately, there were no

handholds above it. After thinking the matter over, however, I made up

my mind to violate, for this occasion only, the rules for climbing. I

inserted the toe, gathered myself, and with one smooth swoop swung

myself across and grabbed that tiny pine!
[Pg 196]Fisher now worked his way out and crossed in the same manner. But Frank

was too heavy for such gymnastics. Fisher therefore took a firm grip on

the pine, inserted his toe in the crevice, and hung on with all his

strength while Frank crossed on his shoulders!

[Pg 197]
CHAPTER III
THE SECOND AND THIRD CLIMBS
Once more, lured by the promise of the tracks we had seen, we climbed

this same mountain, but again without results. By now, you may be sure,

we had found an easier way home! This was a very hard day's work, but

uneventful.
Now, four days later, I crossed the river and set off above to explore

in the direction of the Continental Divide. Of course I had no intention

of climbing for goats, or, indeed, of hunting very hard for anything. My

object was an idle go-look-see. Equally, of course, after I had rammed

around most happily for a while up the wooded stream-bed of that cañon,

I turned sharp to the right and began to climb the slope of the spur,

running out at right angles to the main ranges that constituted one wall

of my cañon. It was fifteen hundred nearly perpendicular feet of hard

scrambling through windfalls. Then when I had gained the ridge, I

thought I might as well keep along it a little distance. And then,

naturally, I saw the main peaks not so very far away; and was in for

it!
On either side of me the mountain dropped away abruptly. I walked on a

knife edge, steeply rising. Great cañons yawned close at either hand,

and over across were leagues of snow mountains.
In the cañon from which I had emerged a fine rain had [Pg 198]been falling.

Here it had turned to wet sleet. As I mounted, the slush underfoot grew

firmer, froze, then changed to dry, powdery snow. This change was

interesting and beautiful, but rather uncomfortable, for my boots,

soaked through by the slush, now froze solid and scraped various patches

of skin from my feet. It was interesting, too, to trace the change in

bird life as the altitude increased. At snow line the species had

narrowed down to a few ravens, a Canada jay, a blue grouse or so,

nuthatches, and brown creepers. I saw one fresh elk track, innumerable

marten, and the pad of a very large grizzly.
The ridge mounted steadily. After I had gained to 2,300 feet above the

cañon I found that the ridge dipped to a saddle 600 feet lower. It

really grieved me to give up that hard-earned six hundred, and then to

buy it back again by another hard, slow, toilsome climb. Again I found

my way barred by some unsuspected cliffs about sixty feet in height.

Fortunately, they were well broken; and I worked my way to the top by

means of ledges.
Atop this the snow suddenly grew deeper and the ascent more precipitous.

I fairly wallowed along. The timber line fell below me. All animal life

disappeared. My only companions were now at spaced-out and mighty

intervals the big bare peaks that had lifted themselves mysteriously

from among their lesser neighbours, with which heretofore they had been

confused. In spite of very heavy exertions, I began to feel the cold; so

I unslung my rucksack and put on my buckskin shirt. The snow had become

very light and feathery. The high, still buttes and crags of the main

divide were right before me. Light fog wreaths drifted [Pg 199]and eddied

slowly, now concealing, now revealing the solemn crags and buttresses.

Over everything—the rocks, the few stunted and twisted small trees, the

very surface of the snow itself—lay a heavy rime of frost. This rime

stood out in long, slender needles an inch to an inch and a half in

length, sparkling and fragile and beautiful. It seemed that a breath of

wind or even a loud sound would precipitate the glittering panoply to

ruin; but in all the really awesome silence and hushed breathlessness of

that strange upper world there was nothing to disturb them. The only

motion was that of the idly-drifting fog wreaths; the only sound was

that made by the singing of the blood in my ears! I felt as though I

were in a world holding its breath.
It was piercing cold. I ate a biscuit and a few prunes, tramping

energetically back and forth to keep warm. I could see in all directions

now: an infinity of bare peaks, with hardly a glimpse of forests or

streams or places where things might live. Goats are certainly either

fools or great poets.
After a half hour of fruitless examination of the cliffs I perforce had

to descend. The trip back was long. It had the added interest in that it

was bringing me nearer water. No thirst is quite so torturing as that

which afflicts one who climbs hard in cold, high altitudes. The throat

and mouth seem to shrivel and parch. Psychologically, it is even worse

than the desert thirst because in cold air it is unreasonable. Finally

it became so unendurable that I turned down from the spur-ridge long

before I should otherwise have done so, and did a good deal of extra

work merely to reach a little sooner the stream at the bottom of the

cañon. When I reached it, I found that here it flowed underground.

[Pg 200]
CHAPTER IV
OTHER CLIMBS
For ten days we hunted and fished. When the opportunity offered, we made

a goat-survey of a new place. Finally, as time grew short, we realized

that we must concentrate our energies in one effort if we were to get

specimens of this most desirable of all American big game. Therefore

Fisher, Frank, Harry, and I, leaving our other two companions and the

majority of the horses at the base camp, packed a few days' provisions

and started in for the highest peaks of all.
We journeyed up an unknown cañon eighteen miles long, heavily wooded in

the bottoms, with great mountains overhanging, and with a beautiful

clear trout stream singing down its bed. The first day we travelled ten

hours. One man was always in front cutting out windfalls or other

obstructions. I should be afraid to guess how many trees we chopped

through that day. Another man scouted ahead for the best route amid

difficulties. The other two performed the soul-destroying task of

getting the horses to follow the appointed way. After three o'clock we

began to hope for horse feed. At dark we reluctantly gave it up. The

forest remained unbroken. We had to tie the poor, unfed horses to trees,

while we ourselves searched diligently and with only partial success for

tiny spots level enough [Pg 201]and clear enough for our beds. It was very cold

that night; and nobody was comfortable; the horses least of all.
Next morning we were out and away by daylight. If we could not find

horse feed inside of four hours, we would be forced to retreat. Three

hours of the four went by. Then Harry and I held the horses while our

companions scouted ahead rapidly. We nearly froze, for in that deep

valley the sun did not rise until nearly noon. Through an opening we

could see back to a tremendous sheer butte rising more than three

thousand feet[C] by a series of very narrow terraced ledges. We named it

the Citadel, so like was it to an ancient proud fortress.
Fisher reported first. He had climbed a tree, but had seen no feed. Ten

minutes later Frank returned. He had found the track of an ancient

avalanche close under the mountain, and in that track grew coarse

grasses. We pushed on, and there made camp.
It was a queer enough camp. Our beds we spread in the various little

spots among the roots and hummocks we imagined to look the most even.

The fire we had to build in quite another place. All around us the

lodge-pole pines, firs, and larches grew close and dark and damp. Only

to the west the snow ranges showed among the treetops like great,

looming white clouds.
For two days we lived high among the glaciers and snow crags, taking

tremendous tramps, seeing wonderful peaks, frozen lakes, sheer cliffs,

the tracks of grizzlies in numbers, the tiny sources of great streams,

and the infinity of upper spaces. But no goats; and no tracks of goats.

Little by [Pg 202]little we eliminated the possibilities of the country

accessible to us. Leagues in all directions, as far as the eye could

reach, was plenty of other country, all equally good for goats; but it

was not within reach of us from this cañon; and our time was up.

Finally, we dropped back and made camp at the last feed; a mile or so

below the Citadel. Two ranges at right angles here converged, and the

Citadel rose like a tower at the corner. Here was our last chance.

[Pg 203]
CHAPTER V
GOATS
As we were finishing breakfast my eye was attracted to a snow speck on

the mountainside some two thousand feet above us and slightly westward

that somehow looked to me different from other snow specks. For nearly a

minute I stared at it through my glasses. At last the speck moved. The

game was in sight!
We drew straws for the shot, and Fisher won. Then we began our climb. It

was the same old story of pumping lungs and pounding hearts; but with

the incentive before us we made excellent time. A shallow ravine and a

fringe of woods afforded us the cover we needed. At the end of an hour

and a half we crawled out of our ravine and to the edge of the trees.

There across a steep cañon and perhaps four hundred yards away were the

goats, two of them, lying on the edge of small cliffs. We could see them

very plainly, but they were too far for a sure shot. After examining

them to our satisfaction we wormed our way back.
"The only sure way," I insisted, "is to climb clear to the top of the

ridge, go along it on the other side until we are above and beyond the

goats, and then to stalk them down hill."
That meant a lot more hard work; but in the end the plan [Pg 204]was adopted.

We resumed our interminable and toilsome climbing.
The ridge proved to be of the knife-edge variety, and covered with snow.

From a deep, wide, walled-in basin on the other side rose the howling of

two brush wolves. We descended a few feet to gain safe concealment;

walked as rapidly as possible to the point above the goats; and then

with the utmost caution began our descent.
In the last two hundred yards is the essence of big-game stalking. The

hunter must move noiselessly, he must keep concealed; he must determine

at each step just what the effect of that step has been in the matters

of noise and of altering the point of view. It is necessary to spy

sharply, not only from the normal elevation of a man's shoulders, but

also stooping to the waist line, and even down to the knees. An animal

is just as suspicious of legs as of heads; and much more likely to see

them.
The shoulder of the mountain here consisted of a series of steep grass

curves ending in short cliff jump-offs. Scattered and stunted trees and

tree groups grew here and there. In thirty minutes we had made our

distance and recognized the fact that our goats must be lying at the

base of the next ledge. Motioning Harry to the left and Fisher to the

front, I myself moved to the right to cut off the game should it run in

that direction. Ten seconds later I heard Fisher shoot; then Harry

opened up; and in a moment a goat ran across the ledge fifty yards below

me. With a thrill of the greatest satisfaction I dropped the gold bead

of my front sight on his shoulder!
The bullet knocked him off the edge of the cliff. He fell, [Pg 205]struck the

steep grass slope, and began to roll. Over and over and over he went,

gathering speed like a snowball, getting smaller and smaller until he

disappeared in the brush far below, a tiny spot of white.
No one can appreciate the feeling of relaxed relief that filled me. Hard

and dangerous climbs, killing work, considerable hardship and discomfort

had at length their reward. I could now take a rest. The day was young,

and I contemplated with something like rapture a return to camp, and a

good puttery day skinning out that goat. In addition I was suffering now

from a splitting headache, the effects of incipient snow-blindness, and

was generally pretty wobbly.
And then my eye wandered to the left, whence that goat had come. I saw a

large splash of blood; at a spot before I had fired! It was too

evident that the goat had already been wounded by Fisher; and therefore,

by hunter's law, belonged to him!
I set my teeth and turned up the mountain to regain the descent we had

just made. At the knife-edge top I stopped for a moment to get my breath

and to survey the country. Diagonally across the basin where the wolves

were howling, half way down the ridge running at right angles to my own,

I made out two goats. They were two miles away from me on an air line.

My course was obvious. I must proceed along my ridge to the Citadel,

keeping always out of sight; surmount that fortress; descend to the

second ridge; walk along the other side of it until I was above those

goats, and then sneak down on them.
I accomplished the first two stages of my journey all [Pg 206]right, though

with considerably more difficulty in spots than I should have

anticipated. The knife edge was so sharp and the sides so treacherous

that at times it was almost impossible to travel anywhere but right on

top. This would not do. By a little planning, however, I managed to

reach the central "keep" of the Citadel: a high, bleak, broken pile,

flat on top, with snow in all the crevices, and small cliffs on all

sides. From this advantage I could cautiously spy out the lay of the

land.
Below me fifty feet dipped the second ridge, running nearly at right

angles. It sloped abruptly to the wolf basin, but fell sheer on the

other side to depths I could not at that time guess.[D] A very few

scattered, stunted, and twisted trees huddled close down to the rock and

snow. This saddle was about fifty feet in width and perhaps five hundred

yards in length. It ended in another craggy butte very much like the

Citadel.
My first glance determined that my original plan would not do. The goats

had climbed from where I had first seen them, and were now leisurely

topping the saddle. To attempt to descend would be to reveal myself. I

was forced to huddle just where I was. My hope was that the goats would

wander along the saddle toward me, and not climb the other butte

opposite. Also I wanted them to hurry, please, as the snow in which I

sat was cold, and the wind piercing.
This apparently they were not inclined to do. They paused, they nibbled

at some scanty moss, they gazed at the scenery, they scratched their

ears. I shifted my posi[Pg 207]tion cautiously—and saw below me,[E] lying on

the snow at the very edge of the cliff, a tremendous billy! He had been

there all the time; and I had been looking over him!
At the crack of the Springfield he lurched forward and toppled slowly

out of sight over the edge of the cliff. The two I had been stalking

instantly disappeared. But on the very top of the butte opposite

appeared another. It was a very long shot,[F] but I had to take chances,

for I could not tell whether or not the one I had just shot was

accessible or not. On a guess I held six inches over his back. The goat

gave one leap forward into space. For twenty feet he fell spread-eagled

and right side up as though flying. Then he began to turn and whirl. As

far as my personal testimony could go, he is falling yet through that

dizzy blue abyss.
"Good-bye, billy," said I, sadly. It looked then as though I had lost

both.
I worked my way down the face of the Citadel until I was just above the

steep snow fields. Here was a drop of six feet. If the snow was soft,

all right. If it was frozen underneath, I would be very likely to

toboggan off into space. I pried loose a small rock and dropped it,

watching with great interest how it lit. It sunk with a dull plunk.

Therefore I made my leap, and found myself waist deep in feathery snow.
With what anxiety I peered over the edge of that precipice the reader

can guess. Thirty feet below was a four-foot ledge. On the edge of that

ledge grew two stunted [Pg 208]pines about three feet in height—and only two.

Against those pines my goat had lodged! In my exultation I straightened

up and uttered a whoop. To my surprise it was answered from behind me.

Frank had followed my trail. He had killed a nanny and was carrying the

head. Everybody had goats!
After a great deal of manœuvring we worked our way down to the ledge

by means of a crevice and a ten-foot pole. Then we tied the goat to the

little trees, and set to work. I held Frank while he skinned; and then

he held me while I skinned. It was very awkward. The tiny landscape

almost directly beneath us was blue with the atmosphere of distance. A

solitary raven discovered us, and began to circle and croak and flop.
"You'll get your meal later," we told him.
Far below us, like suspended leaves swirling in a wind, a dense flock of

snowbirds fluttered.
We got on well enough until it became necessary to sever the backbone.

Then, try as we would, we could not in the general awkwardness reach a

joint with a knife. At last we had a bright idea. I held the head back

while Frank shot the vertebrae in two with his rifle!
Then we loosed the cords that held the body. It fell six hundred feet,

hit a ledge, bounded out, and so disappeared toward the hazy blue map

below. The raven folded his wings and dropped like a plummet, with a

strange rushing sound. We watched him until the increasing speed of his

swoop turned us a little dizzy, and we drew back. When we looked a

moment later he had disappeared into the distance—straight down!
[Pg 209]Now we had to win our way out. The trophy we tied with a rope. I

climbed up the pole, and along the crevice as far as the rope would let

me, hauled up the trophy, jammed my feet and back against both sides of

the "chimney." Frank then clambered past me; and so repeat.
But once in the saddle we found we could not return the way we had come.

The drop-off into the feather snow settled that. A short reconnaissance

made it very evident that we would have to go completely around the

outside of the Citadel, at the level of the saddle, until we had gained

the other ridge. This meant about three quarters of a mile against the

tremendous cliff.
We found a ledge and started. Our packs weighed about sixty pounds

apiece, and we were forced to carry them rather high. The ledge proved

to be from six to ten feet wide, with a gentle slope outward. We could

not afford the false steps, nor the little slips, nor the overbalancings

so unimportant on level ground. Progress was slow and cautious. We could

not but remember the heart-stopping drop of that goat after we had cut

the rope; and the swoop of the raven. Especially at the corners did we

hug close to the wall, for the wind there snatched at us eagerly.
The ledge held out bravely. It had to; for there was no possible way to

get up or down from it. We rounded the shoulder of the pile. Below us

now was another landscape into which to fall—the valley of the stream,

with its forests and its high cliffs over the way. But already we could

see our ridge. Another quarter mile would land us in safety.
[Pg 210]Without warning the ledge pinched out. A narrow tongue of shale, on so

steep a slope that it barely clung to the mountain, ran twenty feet to a

precipice. A touch sent its surface rattling merrily down and into

space. It was only about eight feet across; and then the ledge began

again.
We eyed it. Three steps would take us across. Alternative: return along

the ledge to attack the problem ab initio.
"That shale is going to start," said Frank. "If you stop, she'll sure

carry you over the ledge. But if you keep right on going, fast, I

believe your weight will carry you through."
We readjusted our packs so they could not slip and overbalance us; we

measured and re-measured with our eyes just where those steps would

fall; we took a deep breath—and we hustled. Behind us the fine shale

slid sullenly in a miniature avalanche that cascaded over the edge. Our

"weight had carried us through!"
In camp, we found that Harry's shooting had landed a kid, so that we had

a goat apiece.
We rejoined the main camp next day just ahead of a big snowstorm that

must have made travel all but impossible. Then for five days we rode

out, in snow, sleet, and hail. But we were entirely happy, and

indifferent to what the weather could do to us now.


[Pg 211]ToC
MOISTURE, A TRACE

Last fall I revisited Arizona for the first time in many years. My

ultimate destination lay one hundred and twenty-eight miles south of the

railroad. As I stepped off the Pullman I drew deep the crisp, thin air;

I looked across immeasurable distance to tiny, brittle, gilded buttes; I

glanced up and down a ramshackle row of wooden buildings with crazy

wooden awnings, and I sighed contentedly. Same good old Arizona.
The Overland pulled out, flirting its tail at me contemptuously. A

small, battered-looking car, grayed and caked with white alkali dust,

glided alongside, and from under its swaying and disreputable top

emerged someone I knew. Not individually. But by many campfires of the

past I had foregathered with him and his kind. Same old Arizona, I

repeated to myself.
This person bore down upon me and gently extracted my bag from my grasp.

He stood about six feet three; his face was long and brown and grave;

his figure was spare and strong. Atop his head he wore the sacred

Arizona high-crowned hat, around his neck a bright bandana; no coat, but

an unbuttoned vest; skinny trousers, and boots. Save for lack of spurs

and chaps and revolver he might have been [Pg 212]a moving-picture cowboy.

The spurs alone were lacking from the picture of a real one.
He deposited my bag in the tonneau, urged me into a front seat, and

crowded himself behind the wheel. The effect was that of a grown-up in a

go-cart. This particular brand of tin car had not been built for this

particular size of man. His knees were hunched up either side the

steering column; his huge, strong brown hands grasped most competently

that toy-like wheel. The peak of his sombrero missed the wrinkled top

only because he sat on his spine. I reflected that he must have been

drafted into this job, and I admired his courage in undertaking to

double up like that even for a short journey.
"Roads good?" I asked the usual question as I slammed shut the door.
"Fair, suh," he replied, soberly.
"What time should we get in?" I inquired.
"Long 'bout six o'clock, suh," he informed me.
It was then eight in the morning—one hundred and twenty-eight

miles—ten hours—roads good, eh?—hum.
He touched the starter. The motor exploded with a bang. We moved.
I looked her over. On the running board were strapped two big galvanized

tanks of water. It was almost distressingly evident that the muffler had

either been lost or thrown away. But she was hitting on all four. I

glanced at the speedometer dial. It registered the astonishing total of

29,250 miles.
We swung out the end of the main street and sailed down a road that

vanished in the endless gentle slope of a [Pg 213]"sink." Beyond the sink the

bank rose again, gently, to gain the height of the eyes at some mesas.

Well I know that sort of country. One journeyed for the whole day, and

the mesas stayed where they were; and in between were successively

vast stretches of mesquite, or alkali, or lava outcrops, or sacatone

bottoms, each seeming, while one was in it, to fill all the world

forever, without end; and the day's changes were of mirage and the

shifting colours of distant hills.
It was soon evident that my friend's ideas of driving probably coincided

with his ideas of going up a mountain. When a mounted cowboy climbs a

hill he does not believe in fussing with such nonsense as grades; he

goes straight up. Similarly, this man evidently considered that, as

roads were made for travel and distance for annihilation, one should

turn on full speed and get there. Not one hair's breadth did he deign to

swerve for chuck-hole or stone; not one fractional mile per hour did he

check for gully or ditch. We struck them head-on, bang! did they happen

in our way. Then my head hit the disreputable top. In the mysterious

fashion of those who drive freight wagons my companion remained

imperturbably glued to his seat. I had neither breath nor leisure for

the country or conversation.
Thus one half hour. The speedometer dial showed the figures 29,260. I

allowed myself to think of a possible late lunch at my friend's ranch.
We slowed down. The driver advanced the hand throttle the full sweep of

the quadrant, steered with his knees, and produced the "makings." The

faithful little motor continued to hit on all four, but in slow and

painful succession, [Pg 214]each explosion sounding like a pistol shot. We had

passed already the lowest point of the "sink," and were climbing the

slope on the other side. The country, as usual, looked perfectly level,

but the motor knew different.
"I like to hear her shoot," said the driver, after his first cigarette.

"That's why I chucked the muffler. Its plumb lonesome out yere all by

yourself. A hoss is different."
"Who you riding for?"
"Me? I'm riding for me. This outfit is mine."
It didn't sound reasonable; but that's what I heard.
"You mean you drive this car—as a living——"
"Correct."
"I should think you'd get cramped!" I burst out.
"Me? I'm used to it. I bet I ain't missed three days since I got

her—and that's about a year ago."
He answered my questions briefly, volunteering nothing. He had never had

any trouble with the car; he had never broken a spring; he'd overhauled

her once or twice; he averaged sixteen actual miles to the gallon. If I

were to name the car I should have to write advt. after this article to

keep within the law. I resolved to get one. We chugged persistently

along on high gear; though I believe second would have been better.
Presently we stopped and gave her a drink. She was boiling like a little

tea kettle, and she was pretty thirsty.
"They all do it," said Bill. Of course his name was Bill. "Especially

the big he-ones. High altitude. Going slow with your throttle wide open.

You're all right if you got plenty water. If not, why then ketch a cow

and use [Pg 215]the milk. Only go slow or you'll git all clogged up with

butter."
We clambered aboard and proceeded. That distant dreamful mesa had

drawn very near. It was scandalous. The aloof desert whose terror, whose

beauty, whose wonder, whose allure was the awe of infinite space that

could be traversed only in toil and humbleness, had been contracted by a

thing that now said 29,265.
"At this rate we'll get there before six o'clock," I remarked,

hopefully.
"Oh, this is County Highway!" said Bill.
As we crawled along, still on high gear—that tin car certainly pulled

strongly—a horseman emerged from a fold in the hills. He was riding a

sweat-covered, mettlesome black with a rolling eye. His own eye was

bitter, and likewise the other features of his face. After trying in

vain to get the frantic animal within twenty feet of our mitrailleuse,

he gave it up.
"Got anything for me?" he shrieked at Bill.
Bill leisurely turned off the switch, draped his long legs over the side

of the car, and produced his makings.
"Nothing, Jim. Expaicting of anything?"
"Sent for a new grass rope. How's feed down Mogallon way?"
"Fair. That a bronco you're riding?"
"Just backed him three days ago."
"Amount to anything?"
"That," said Jim, with an extraordinary bitterness, "is already a gaited

hoss. He has fo' gaits now."
"Four gaits," repeated Bill, incredulously. "I'm in the [Pg 216]stink wagon

business. I ain't aiming to buy no hosses. What four gaits you claim

he's got?"
"Start, stumble, fall down and git up," said Jim.
Shortly after this joyous rencontre we topped the rise, and, looking

back, could realize the grade we had been ascending.
The road led white and straight as an arrow to dwindle in perspective to

a mere thread. The little car leaped forward on the invisible down

grade. Again I anchored myself to one of the top supports. A long, rangy

fowl happened into the road just ahead of us, but immediately flopped

clumsily, half afoot, half a-wing, to one side in the brush, like a

stampeded hen.
"Road runner," said Bill, with a short laugh. "Remember how they used to

rack along in front of a hoss for miles, keeping just ahead, lettin' out

a link when you spurred up? Aggravatin' fowl! They got over tryin' to

keep ahead of gasoline."
In the white alkaline road lay one lone, pyramidal rock. It was about

the size of one's two fists and all its edges and corners were sharp.

Probably twenty miles of clear space lay on either flank of that rock.

Nevertheless, our right front wheel hit it square in the middle. The car

leaped straight up, the rock popped sidewise, and the tire went off with

a mighty bang. Bill put on the brakes, deliberately uncoiled himself,

and descended.
"Seems like tires don't last no time at all in this country," he

remarked, sadly. He walked around the car and began to examine the four

wrecks he carried as spares. After some inspection of their respective

merits, he selected [Pg 217]one. "I just somehow kain't git over the notion she

ought to sidestep them little rocks and holes of her own accord," he

exclaimed. "A hoss is a plumb, narrow-minded critter, but he knows

enough for that."
While he changed the tire—which incidentally involved patching one of

half a dozen over-worn tubes—I looked her over more in detail. The

customary frame, strut rods, and torsion rods had been supplemented by

the most extraordinary criss-cross of angle-iron braces it has ever been

my fortune to behold. They ran from anywhere to everywhere beneath that

car. I began to comprehend her cohesiveness.
"Jim Coles, blacksmith at the O T, puts them braces in all our cars,"

explained Bill. "He's got her down to a system."
The repair finished and the radiator refilled we resumed the journey. It

was now just eleven o'clock. The odometer reading was 29,276. The

temperature was well up toward 100 degrees. But beneath the disreputable

top, and while in motion, the heat was not noticeable. Nevertheless, the

brief stop had brought back poignantly certain old days—choking dust,

thirst, the heat of a heavy sun, the long day that led one nowhere——
The noon mirages were taking shape, throwing stately and slow their vast

illusions across the horizon. Lakes glimmered; distant ranges took on

the forms of phantasm, rising higher, flattening, reaching across space

the arches of their spans, rendering unreal a world of beauty and dread.

That in the old days was the deliberate fashion the desert had of

searing men's souls with her majesty. [Pg 218]Slowly, slowly, the changes

melted one into the other; massively, deliberately the face of the world

was altered; so that at last the poor plodding human being, hot, dry,

blinded, thirsty, felt himself a nothing in the presence of eternities.

Well I knew that old spell of the desert. But now! Honestly, after a few

minutes I began to feel sorry for the poor old desert! Its spells didn't

work for the simple reason that we didn't give it time! We charged

down on its phantom lakes and disproved them and forgot them. We broke

right in on the dignified and deliberate scene shifting of mountains and

mesas, showed them up for the brittle, dry hills they were, and left

them behind. It was pitiful! It was as though a revered tragedian should

overnight find that his vogue had departed; that he was no longer

getting over; that an irreverent upstart, breaking in on his most

sonorous periods, was getting laughs with slang. We had lots of water;

the dust we left behind; it wasn't even hot in the wind of our going!
In the shallow crease of hills a shimmer of white soon changed to

evident houses. We drew into a straggling desert town.
It was typical—thirty miles from the railroad, a distributing point for

the cattle country. Four broad buildings with peeled, sunburned faces, a

wooden house or so, and a dozen flat-roofed adobe huts hung pleasingly

with long strips of red peppers. Of course one of the wooden buildings

was labelled General Store; and another, smaller, contained a barber

shop and postoffice combined. The third was barred and unoccupied. The

fourth had been a livery stable but was now a garage. Six saddle horses

[Pg 219]and six Fords stood outside the General Store, which was a fair

division.
Bill slowed down.
"Have a drink," I observed, hospitably.
"Arizona's a dry state," Bill reminded me; but nevertheless stopped and

uncoiled. That unbelievable phenomenon had escaped my memory. In the old

days I used to shut my eyes and project my soul into what I imagined was

the future. I saw Arizona, embottled, dying in the last-wet ditch, while

all the rest of the world, even including Milwaukee, bore down on her

carrying the banners of Prohibition. So much for prophecy. I voiced a

thought.
"There must be an awful lot of old timers died this spring. You can't

cut them off short and hope to save them."
Bill grunted.
We entered the store. It smelled good, as such stores always do—soap,

leather, ground coffee, bacon, cheese—all sorts of things. On the right

ran a counter and shelves of dry goods and clothing; on the left

groceries, cigars, and provisions generally. Down the middle saddles,

ropes, spurs, pack outfits, harness, hardware. In the rear a glass

cubby-hole with a desk inside. All that was customary, right and proper.

But I noticed also a glass case with spark plugs and accessories; a rack

full of tires; and a barrel of lubricating oil. I did not notice any

body polish. By the front door stood a paper-basket whose purport I

understood not at all.
Bill led me at once past two or three lounging cow persons to the

cubbyhole, where arose a typical old timer.
[Pg 220]"Mr. White, meet Mr. Billings," he said.
The old timer grasped me firmly by the right hand and held tight while

he demanded, as usual, "What name?" We informed him together. He allowed

he was pleased. I allowed the same.
"I want to buy a yard of calico," said Bill.
The old timer reached beneath the counter and produced a strip of cloth.

It was already cut, and looked to be about a yard long. Also it showed

the marks of loving but brutal and soiled hands.
"Wrap it up?" inquired Mr. Billings.
"Nope," said Bill, and handed out three silver dollars. Evidently calico

was high in these parts. We turned away.
"By the way, Bill," Mr. Billings called after us, "I got a little

present here for you. Some friends sent her in to me the other day. Let

me know what you think of it."
We turned. Mr. Billings held in his hand a sealed quart bottle with a

familiar and famous label.
"Why, that's kind of you," said Bill, gravely. He took the proffered

bottle, turned it upside down, glanced at the bottom, and handed it

back. "But I don't believe I'd wish for none of that particular breed.

It never did agree with my stummick."
Without a flicker of the eye the storekeeper produced a second sealed

bottle, identical in appearance and label with the first.
"Try it," he urged. "Here's one from a different case. Some of these

yere vintages is better than others."
"So I've noticed," replied Bill, dryly. He glanced at the bottom and

slipped it into his pocket.
[Pg 221]We went out. As we passed the door Bill, unobserved, dropped into the

heretofore unexplained waste-basket the yard of calico he had just

purchased.
"Don't believe I like the pattern for my boudoir," he told me, gravely.
We clambered aboard and shot our derisive exhaust at the diminishing

town.
"Thought Arizona was a dry state," I suggested.
"She is. You cain't sell a drop. But you can keep stuff for personal

use. There ain't nothing more personal than givin' it away to your

friends."
"The price of calico is high down here."
"And goin' up," agreed Bill, gloomily. He drove ten miles in silence

while I, knowing my type, waited.
"That old Billings ought to be drug out and buried," he remarked at

last. "We rode together on the Chiracahua range. He ought to know better

than to try to put it onto me."
"???" said I.
"You saw that first bottle? Just plain forty-rod dog poison—and me

payin' three good round dollars!"
"For calico," I reminded.
"Shore. That's why he done it. He had me—if I hadn't called him."
"But that first bottle was identically the same as the one you have in

your pocket," I stated.
"Shore?"
"Why, yes—at least—that is, the bottle and label were the same, and I

particularly noticed the cork seal looked intact."
[Pg 222]"It was," agreed Bill. "That cap hasn't never been disturbed. You're

right."
"Then what objection——"
"It's one of them wonders of modern science that spoils the simple life

next to Nature's heart," said Bill, unexpectedly. "You hitch a big

hollow needle onto an electric light current. When she gets hot enough

you punch a hole with her in the bottom of the bottle. Then you throw

the switch and let the needle cool off. When she's cool you pour out the

real thing for your own use—mebbe. Then you stick in your

forty-cent-a-gallon squirrel poison. Heat up your needle again. Draw her

out very slow so the glass will close up behind her. Simple, neat,

effective, honest enough for down here. Cork still there, seal still

there, label still there. Bottle still there, except for a little bit of

a wart-lookin' bubble in the bottom."
It was now in the noon hour. Knowing cowboys of old I expected no lunch.

We racketed along, and our dust tried to catch us, and sleepy,

accustomed jack rabbits made two perfunctory hops as we turned on them

the battery of our exhaust.
We dipped down into a carved bottomland, several miles wide, filled with

minarets, peaks, vermilion towers, and strange striped labyrinths of

many colours above which the sky showed an unbelievable blue. The trunks

of colossal trees lay about in numbers. Apparently they had all been

cross-cut in sections like those sawed for shake bolts, for each was

many times clearly divided. The sections, however, lay all in place; so

the trunks of the trees were as they had fallen. About the ground were

scattered frag[Pg 223]ments of rock of all sizes, like lava, but of all the

colours of the giddiest parrots. The tiniest piece had at least all the

tints of the spectrum; and the biggest seemed to go the littlest several

better. They looked to me like beautiful jewels. Bill cast at them a

contemptuous glance.
"Every towerist I take in yere makes me stop while he sags down the car

with this junk," he said. Whenever I say "Bill said" or "I said," I

imply that we shrieked, for always through that great, still country we

hustled enveloped in a profanity of explosions, creaks, rattles, and

hums. Just now though, on a level, we travelled at a low gear.

"Petrified wood," Bill added.
I swallowed guiltily the request I was about to proffer.
The malpais defined itself. We came to a wide, dry wash filled with

white sand. Bill brought the little car to a stop.
Well I know that sort of sand! You plunge rashly into it on low gear;

you buzz bravely for possibly fifty feet; you slow down, slow down; your

driving wheels begin to spin—that finishes you. Every revolution digs a

deeper hole. It is useless to apply power. If you are wise you throw out

your clutch the instant she stalls, and thus save digging yourself in

unnecessarily. But if you are really wise you don't get in that fix at

all. The next stage is that wherein you thrust beneath the hind wheels

certain expedients such as robes, coats, and so forth. The wheels, when

set in motion, hurl these trivialities yards to the rear. The car then

settles down with a shrug. About the time the axle is actually resting

on the sand you proceed to serious digging, cutting brush, and laying

causeways. Some [Pg 224]sand you can get out of by these methods, but not dry,

stream-bed sand in the Southwest. Finally you reach; the state of true

wisdom. Either you sit peacefully in the tonneau and smoke until someone

comes along; or, if you are doubtful of that miracle, you walk to the

nearest team and rope. And never, never, never are you caught again! A

détour of fifty miles is nothing after that!
While Bill manipulated the makings, I examined the prospects. This was

that kind of a wash; no doubt of it!
"How far is the nearest crossing?" I asked, returning.
"About eight feet," said he.
My mind, panic-stricken, flew to several things—that bottle (I regret

that I failed to record that by test its contents had proved genuine),

the cornered rock we had so blithely charged, other evidences of Bill's

casual nature. My heart sank.
"You ain't going to tackle that wash!" I cried.
"I shore am," said Bill.
I examined Bill. He meant it.
"How far to the nearest ranch?"
"'Bout ten mile."
I went and sat on a rock. It was one of those rainbow remnants of a

bygone past; but my interest in curios had waned.
Bill dove into the grimy mysteries of under the back seat and produced

two blocks of wood six or eight inches square and two strong straps with

buckles. He inserted a block between the frame of the car and the rear

axle; then he ran a strap around the rear spring and cinched on it until

the car [Pg 225]body, the block, and the axle made one solid mass. In other

words, the spring action was entirely eliminated. He did the same thing

on the other side.
"Climb in," said he.
We went into low and slid down the steep clay bank into the waiting

sand. To me it was like a plunge into ice water. Bill stepped on her. We

ploughed out into trouble. The steering wheel bucked and jerked vainly

against Bill's huge hands; we swayed like a moving-picture comic; but we

forged steadily ahead. Not once did we falter. Our wheels gripped

continuously. When we pulled out on the other bank I exhaled as though

I, too, had lost my muffler. I believe I had held my breath the whole

way across. Bill removed the blocks and gave her more water. Still in

low we climbed out of the malpais.
It was now after two o'clock. We registered 29,328. I was getting humble

minded. Six o'clock looked good enough to me now.
One thing was greatly encouraging. As we rose again to the main level of

the country I recognized over the horizon a certain humped mountain.

Often in the "good old days" I had approached this mountain from the

south. Beneath its flanks lay my friend's ranch, our destination. Five

hours earlier in my experience its distance would have appalled me; but

my standards had changed. Nevertheless, it seemed far enough away. I was

getting physically tired. There is a heap of exercise in many

occupations, such as digging sewers and chopping wood and shopping with

a woman; but driving in small Arizona motor cars need give none of these

occupations any odds. And of late [Pg 226]years I have been accustoming myself

to three meals a day.
For this reason there seems no excuse for detailing the next three

hours. From three o'clock until sunset the mirages slowly fade away into

the many-tinted veils of evening. I know that because I've seen it; but

never would I know it whilst an inmate of a gasoline madhouse. We

carried our own egg-shaped aura constantly with us, on the invisible

walls of which the subtle and austere influences of the desert beat in

vain. That aura was composed of speed, bumps, dust, profane noise, and

an extreme and exotic busyness. It might be that in a docile, tame,

expensive automobile, garnished with a sane and biddable driver, one

might see the desert as it is. I don't know whether such a combination

exists. But me—I couldn't get into the Officers' Training Camp because

of my advanced years: I may be an old fogy, but I cherish a sneaking

idea that perhaps you have to buy some of these things at the cost of

the aforementioned thirst, heat, weariness, and the slow passing of long

days. Still, an Assyrian brick in the British Museum is inscribed by a

father to his son away at school with a lament over the passing of the

"good old days!"
At any rate, we drew into Spring Creek at five o'clock, shooting at

every jump. My friend's ranch was only six miles farther. This was home

for Bill, and we were soon surrounded by many acquaintances. He had

letters and packages for many of them; and detailed many items of local

news. To us shortly came a cowboy who had evidently bought all the

calico he could carry. This person was also long and lean and brown;

hard bitten; be[Pg 227]decked with worn brown leather chaps, and wearing a

gun. The latter he unbuckled and cast from him with great scorn.
"And I don't need no gun to do it, neither!" he stated, as though

concluding a long conversation.
"Shore not, Slim," agreed one of the group, promptly annexing the

artillery. "What is it?"
"Kill that —— —— —— Beck," said Slim, owlishly. "I can do it; and

I can do it with my bare hands, b' God!"
He walked sturdily enough in the direction of the General Store across

the dusty square. No one paid any further attention to his movements.

The man who had picked up the gun belt buckled it around his own waist.

Bill refilled the ever-thirsty radiator, peered at his gasoline gauge,

leisurely turned down a few grease cups. Ten minutes passed. We were

about ready to start.
Back across the square drifted a strange figure. With difficulty we

recognized it as the erstwhile Slim. He had no hat. His hair stuck out

in all directions. One eye was puffing shut, blood oozed from a cut in

his forehead and dripped from his damaged nose. One shirt sleeve had

been half torn from its parent at the shoulder. But, most curious of

all, Slim's face was evenly marked by a perpendicular series of long,

red scratches as though he had been dragged from stem to stern along a

particularly abrasive gravel walk. Slim seemed quite calm.
His approach was made in a somewhat strained silence. At length there

spoke a dry, sardonic voice.
"Well," said it, "did you kill Beck?"
[Pg 228]"Naw!" replied Slim's remains disgustedly, "the son of a gun wouldn't

fight!"
We reached my friend's ranch just about dusk. He met me at the yard

gate.
"Well!" he said, heartily. "I'm glad you're here! Not much like the old

days, is it?"
I agreed with him.
"Journey out is dull and uninteresting now. But compared to the way we

used to do it, it is a cinch. Just sit still and roll along."
I disagreed with him—mentally.
"The old order has changed," said he.
"Yes," I agreed, "now it's one yard of calico."

THE RANCH

CHAPTER I
THE NEW AND THE OLD
The old ranching days of California are to all intents and purposes past

and gone. To be sure there remain many large tracts supporting a single

group of ranch buildings, and over which the cattle wander "on a

thousand hills." There are even a few, a very few—like the ranch of

which I am going to write—that are still undivided, still game haunted,

still hospitable, still delightful. But in spite of these apparent

exceptions, my first statement must stand. About the large tracts swarm

real estate men, eager for the chance to subdivide into small farms—and

the small farmers pour in from the East at the rate of a thousand a

month. No matter how sternly the old land-lords set their faces against

the new order of things, the new order of things will prevail; for

sooner or late old land-lords must die, and the heirs have not in them

the spirit of the ancient tradition. This is, of course, best for the

country and for progress; but something passes, and is no more. So the

Chino ranch and more recently Lucky Baldwin's broad acres have yielded.
And even in the case of those that still remain intact, [Pg 230]whose wide

hills and plains graze thousands of head of cattle; whose pastures breed

their own cowhorses; whose cowmen, wearing still with a twist of pride

the all-but-vanished regalia of their all-but-vanished calling, refuse

to drop back to the humdrum status of "farm hands on a cow ranch"; even

here has entered a single element powerful enough to change the old to

something new. The new may be better—it is certainly more

convenient—and perhaps when all is said and done we would not want to

go back to the old. But the old is gone. One single modern institution

has been sufficient to render it completely of the past. That

institution is the automobile.
In the old days—and they are but yesterdays, after all—the ranch was

perforce an isolated community. The journey to town was not to be

lightly undertaken; indeed, as far as might be, it was obviated

altogether. Blacksmithing, carpentry, shoe cobbling, repairing,

barbering, and even mild doctoring were all to be done on the premises.

Nearly every item of food was raised at home, including vegetables,

fruit, meat, eggs, fowl, butter, and honey. Above all, the inhabitants

of that ranch settled down comfortably into the realization that their

only available community was that immediately about them; and so they

both made and were influenced by the individual atmosphere of the place.
In the latter years they have all purchased touring cars, and now they

run to town casually, on almost any excuse. They make shopping lists as

does the city dweller; they go back for things forgotten; and they

return to the ranch as one returns to his home on the side streets of a

[Pg 231]great city. In place of the old wonderful and impressive expeditions to

visit in state the nearest neighbour (twelve miles distant), they drop

over of an afternoon for a ten-minutes' chat. The ranch is no longer an

environment in which one finds the whole activity of his existence, but

a dwelling place from which one goes forth.
I will admit that this is probably a distinct gain; but the fact is

indubitable that, even in these cases where the ranch life has not been

materially changed otherwise, the automobile has brought about a

condition entirely new. And as the automobile has fortunately come to

stay, the old will never return. It is of the old, and its charm and

leisure, that I wish to write.

[Pg 232]
CHAPTER II
THE OLD WEST
I went to the ranch many years ago, stepping from the train somewhere

near midnight into a cold, crisp air full of stars. My knowledge of

California was at that time confined to several seasons spent on the

coast, where the straw hat retires only in deference to a tradition

which none of the flowers seem bound to respect. As my dress accorded

with this experience, I was very glad to be conducted across the street

to a little hotel. My guide was an elderly, very brown man, with a white

moustache, and the bearing of an army regular. This latter surmise later

proved correct. Manning was one of the numerous old soldiers who had

fought through the General's Apache campaigns, and who now in his age

had drifted back to be near his old commander. He left me, after many

solicitations as to my comfort, and a promise to be back with the team

at seven o'clock sharp.
Promptly at that hour he drew up by the curb. My kit bag was piled

aboard, and I clambered in beside the driver. Manning touched his team.

We were off.
The rig was of the sort usual to the better California ranches of the

day, and so, perhaps, worth description. It might best be defined as a

rather wide, stiff buckboard set on springs, and supported by stout

running gear. The single seat was set well forward, while the body of

the rig [Pg 233]extended back to receive the light freight an errand to town

was sure to accumulate. An ample hood top of gray canvas could be raised

for protection against either sun, wind, or rain. Most powerful brakes

could be manipulated by a thrust of the driver's foot. You may be sure

they were outside brakes. Inside brakes were then considered the weak

expedients of a tourist driving mercenary. Generally the tongue and

moving gear were painted cream; and the body of the vehicle dark green.
This substantial, practical, and business-like vehicle was drawn by a

pair of mighty good bright bay horses, straight backed, square rumped,

deep shouldered, with fine heads, small ears, and alert yet gentle eyes

of high-bred stock. When the word was given, they fell into a steady,

swinging trot. One felt instinctively the power of it, and knew that

they were capable of keeping up this same gait all day. And that would

mean many miles. Their harness was of plain russet leather, neat and

well oiled.
Concerning them I made some remark, trivial yet enough to start Manning.

He told me of them, and of their peculiarities and virtues. He descanted

at length on their breeding, and whence came they and their fathers and

their fathers' fathers even unto the sixth generation. He left me at

last with the impression that this was probably the best team in the

valley, bar none. It was a good team, strong, spirited, gentle, and

enduring.
We swung out from the little town into a straight road. If it has seemed

that I have occupied you too exclusively with objects near at hand, the

matter could not be helped. There was nothing more to occupy you. A fog

held all the land.
[Pg 234]It was a dense fog, and a very cold. Twenty feet ahead of the horses

showed only a wall of white. To right and left dim, ghostly bushes or

fence posts trooped by us at the ordered pace of our trot. An occasional

lone poplar tree developed in the mist as an object on a dry plate

develops. We splashed into puddles, crossed culverts, went through all

the business of proceeding along a road—and apparently got nowhere. The

mists opened grudgingly before us, and closed in behind. As far as

knowing what the country was like I might as well have been blindfolded.
From Manning I elicited piecemeal some few and vague ideas. This

meagreness was not due to a disinclination on Manning's part, but only

to the fact that he never quite grasped my interest in mere

surroundings. Yes, said he, it was a pretty flat country, and some

brush. Yes, there were mountains, some ways off, though. Not many trees,

but some—what you might call a few. And so on, until I gave it up.

Mountains, trees, brush, and flat land! One could construct any and all

landscapes with such building blocks as those.
Now, as has been hinted, I was dressed for southern California; and the

fog was very damp and chill. The light overcoat I wore failed utterly to

exclude it. At first I had been comfortable enough, but as mile

succeeded mile the cold of that winter land fog penetrated to the bone.

In answer to my comment Manning replied cheerfully in the words of an

old saw:

"A winter's fog
Will freeze a dog,"

said he.
[Pg 235]I agreed with him. We continued to jog on. Manning detailed what I then

thought were hunting lies as to the abundance of game; but which I

afterward discovered were only sober truths. When too far gone in the

miseries of abject cold I remembered his former calling, and glancing

sideways at his bronzed, soldierly face, wished I had gumption enough

left to start him going on some of his Indian campaigns. It was too

late; I had not the gumption; I was too cold.
Now I believe I am fairly well qualified to know when I really feel

cold. I have slept out with the thermometer out of sight somewhere down

near the bulb; I once snowshoed nine miles; and then overheated from

that exertion, drove thirty-five without additional clothing. On various

other occasions I have had experiences that might be called frigid. But

never have I been quite so deadly cold as on that winter morning's drive

through the land fog of semi-tropical California. It struck through to

the very heart.
I subsequently discovered that it takes two hours and three quarters to

drive to the ranch. That is a long time when one has nothing to look at,

and when one is cold. In fact, it is so long that one loses track of

time at all, and gradually relapses into that queer condition of passive

endurance whereto is no end and no beginning. Therefore the end always

comes suddenly, and as a surprise.
So it was in this case. Out of the mists sprang suddenly two tall fan

palms, and then two others, and still others. I realized dimly that we

were in an avenue of palms. The wheels grated strangely on gravel. We

swung sharply to the left between hedges. The mass of a building loomed

[Pg 236]indistinctly. Manning applied the brakes. We stopped, the steam from

the horses' shining backs rising straight up to mingle with the fog.
"Well, here we are!" said Manning.
So we were! I hadn't thought of that. We must be here. After an

appreciable moment it occurred to me that perhaps I'd better climb down.

I did so, very slowly and stiffly, making the sad mistake of jumping

down from the height of the step. How that did injure my feelings! The

only catastrophe I can remember comparable to it was when a teacher

rapped my knuckles with a ruler after I had been making snowballs bare

handed. My benumbed faculties next swung around to the proposition of

proceeding up an interminable gravel walk—(it is twenty-five feet

long!) to a forbidding flight of stairs—(porch steps—five of them!) I

put this idea into execution. I reached the steps. And then——
The door was flung open from within, I could see the sparkle and leap of

a fine big grate fire. The Captain stood in the doorway, a broad smile

on his face; my hostess smiled another welcome behind him; the General

roared still another from somewhere behind her.
Now I had never met the Captain. He held out both hands in greeting. One

of those hands was for me to shake. The other held a huge glass of hot

scotch. The hot scotch was in the right hand!

[Pg 237]
CHAPTER III
THE PEOPLE AND THE PLACE
They warmed me through, and then another old soldier named Redmond took

me up to show me where I lived. We clambered up narrow boxed stairs that

turned three ways; we walked down a narrow passage; turned to the right;

walked down another narrow passage, climbed three steps to open a door;

promptly climbed three steps down again; crossed a screened-in bridge to

another wing; ducked through a passageway, and so arrived. The ranch

house was like that. Parts of it were built out on stilts. Five or six

big cottonwood trees grew right up through the verandahs, and spread out

over the roof of the house. There are all sorts of places where you hang

coats, or stack guns, or store shells, or find unexpected books;

passageways leading to outdoor upstairs screened porches, cubby holes

and the like. And whenever you imagine the house must be quite full of

guests, they can always discover to you yet another bedroom. It may, at

the last, be a very tiny bedroom, with space enough only for a single

bed and not much else; and you may get to it only by way of out of

doors; and it may be already fairly well occupied by wooden decoys and

shotgun shells, but there it is, guests and guests after you thought the

house must be full.
Belonging and appertaining unto the house were several [Pg 238]fixtures. One of

these was old Charley, the Chinese cook. He had been there twenty-five

years. In that time he had learned perfect English, acquired our kind of

a sense of humour, come to a complete theoretical understanding of how

to run a ranch and all the people on it, and taught Pollymckittrick what

she knew.
Pollymckittrick was the bereaved widow of the noble pair of yellow and

green parrots Noah selected for his ark. At least I think she was that

old. She was certainly very wise in both Oriental and Occidental wisdom.

Her chief accomplishments, other than those customary to parrots, were

the ability to spell, and to sing English songs. "After the Ball" and

"Daisy Bell" were her favourites, rendered with occasional jungle

variations. She considered Charley her only real friend, though she

tolerated some others. Pollymckittrick was a product of artificial

civilization. No call of the wild in hers! She preferred her cage,

gilded or otherwise. Each afternoon the cage was placed out on the lawn

so Pollymckittrick could have her sun bath. One day a big redtail hawk

sailed by. Pollymckittrick fell backward off her perch, flat on her

back. The sorrowing family gathered to observe this extraordinary case

of heart failure. After an interval Pollymckittrick unfilmed one yellow

eye.
"Po—o—or Pollymckittrick!" she remarked.
At the sight of that hawk Pollymckittrick had fainted!
The third institution having to do with the house was undoubtedly

Redmond. Redmond was another of the old soldiers who had in their age

sought out their beloved General. Redmond was a sort of all-round man.

He built [Pg 239]the fires very early in the morning; and he did your boots and

hunting clothes, got out the decoys, plucked the ducks, saw to the

shells, fed the dogs, and was always on hand at arrival and departure to

lend a helping hand. He dwelt in a square room in the windmill tower

together with a black cat and all the newspapers in the world. The cat

he alternately allowed the most extraordinary liberties or disciplined

rigorously. On the latter occasions he invariably seized the animal and

hurled it bodily through the open window. The cat took the long fall

quite calmly, and immediately clambered back up the outside stairway

that led to the room. The newspapers he read, and clipped therefrom

items of the most diverse nature to which he deprecatingly invited

attention. Once in so often a strange martial fervour would obsess him.

Then the family, awakened in the early dawn, would groan and turn over,

realizing that its rest was for that morning permanently shattered. The

old man had hoisted his colours over the windmill tower, and now in a

frenzy of fervour was marching around and around the tower beating the

long roll on his drum. After one such outbreak he would be his ordinary,

humble, quiet, obliging, almost deprecating self for another month or

so. The ranch people took it philosophically.
The fourth institution was Nobo. Nobo was a Japanese woman who bossed

the General. She was a square-built person of forty or so who had also

been with the family unknown years. Her capabilities were undoubted; as

also her faith in them. The hostess depended on her a good deal; and at

the same time chafed mildly under her calm assumption that she knew

perfectly what the situation [Pg 240]demanded. The General took her domination

amusedly. To be sure nobody was likely to fool much with the General.

His vast good nature had way down beneath it something that on occasion

could be stern. Nobo could and would tell the General what clothes to

wear, and when to change them, and such matters; but she never ventured

to inhibit the General's ideas as to going forth in rains, or driving

where he everlastingly dod-blistered pleased, or words to that effect,

across country in his magnificently rattletrap surrey, although she

often looked very anxious. For she adored the General. But we all did

that.
As though the heavy curtain of fog had been laid upon the land expressly

that I might get my first impressions of the ranch in due order, about

noon the weather cleared. Even while we ate lunch, the sun came out.

After the meal we went forth to see what we could see.
The ranch was situated in the middle of a vast plain around three sides

of which rose a grand amphitheatre of mountains. The nearest of them was

some thirty miles away, yet ordinarily, in this clear, dry, Western

atmosphere they were always imminent. Over their eastern ramparts the

sun rose to look upon a chill and frosty world; behind their western

barriers the sun withdrew, leaving soft air, purple shadows, and the

flight of dim, far wildfowl across a saffron sky. To the north was only

distance and the fading of the blue of the heavens to the pearl gray of

the horizon.
So much if one stepped immediately beyond the ranch itself. The plains

were broad. Here and there the flatness broke in a long, low line of

cottonwoods marking the winding course of a slough or trace of subsoil

water. Mes[Pg 241]quite lay in dark patches; sagebrush; the green of

pasture-land periodically overflowed by the irrigation water. Nearer at

home were occasional great white oaks, or haystacks bigger than a house,

and shaped like one.
To the distant eye the ranch was a grove of trees. Cottonwoods and

eucalyptus had been planted and had thriven mightily on the abundant

artesian water. We have already noticed the six or eight great trees

growing fairly up through the house. On the outskirts lay also a fruit

orchard of several hundred acres. Opposite the house, and separated from

it by a cedar hedge, was a commodious and attractive bungalow for the

foreman. Beyond him were the bunk house, cook houses, blacksmith shops,

and the like.
We started our tour of inspection by examining and commenting gravely

upon the dormant rose garden and equally dormant grape arbour. Through

this we came to the big wire corrals in which were kept the dogs. Here I

met old Ben.
Old Ben was not very old; but he was different from young Ben. He was a

pointer of the old-fashioned, stocky-built, enduring type common—and

serviceable—before our bench-show experts began to breed for speed,

fineness, small size—and lack of stamina. Ben proved in the event to be

a good all-round dog. He combined the attributes of pointer, cocker

spaniel, and retriever. In other words, he would hunt quail in the

orthodox fashion; or he would rustle into the mesquite thorns for the

purpose of flushing them out to us; or he would swim anywhere any number

of times to bring out ducks. To be sure he occasionally [Pg 242]got a little

mixed. At times he might try to flush quail in the open, instead of

standing them; or would attempt to retrieve some perfectly lively

specimens. Then Ben needed a licking; and generally got it. He lacked in

his work some of the finish and style of the dogs we used after grouse

in Michigan, but he was a good all-round dog for the work. Furthermore,

he was most pleasant personally.
Next door to him lived the dachshunds.
The dachshunds were a marvel, a nuisance, a bone of contention, an

anomaly, an accident, and a farce. They happened because somebody had

once given the hostess a pair of them. I do not believe she cared

particularly for them; but she is good natured, and the ranch is large,

and they are rather amusing. At the time of my first visit the original

pair had multiplied. Gazing on that yardful of imbecile-looking canines,

my admiration for Noah's wisdom increased; he certainly needed no more

than a pair to restock the earth. Redmond claimed there were twenty-two

of them, though nobody else pretended to have been able to disentangle

them enough for a census. They were all light brown in colour; and the

aggregation reminded me of a rather disentangled bunch of angle-worms.

They lived in a large enclosure; and emerged therefrom only under

supervision, for they considered chickens and young pigs their especial

prey. The Captain looked upon them with exasperated tolerance; Redmond

with affection; the hostess, I think, with a good deal of the

partisanship inspired not so much by liking as by the necessity of

defending them against ridicule; and the rest of the world with amused

expectation as to what they would do next. The Captain [Pg 243]was continually

uttering half-serious threats as to the different kinds of sudden death

he was going to inflict on the whole useless, bandylegged, snipe-nosed,

waggle-eared——
The best comment was offered last year by the chauffeur of the

automobile. After gazing on the phenomenon of their extraordinary build

for some moments he remarked thoughtfully:
"Those dogs have a mighty long wheel base!"
For some reason unknown two of the dachshunds have been elevated from

the ranks, and have house privileges. Their names are respectively Pete

and Pup. They hate each other, and have sensitive dispositions. It took

me just four years to learn to tell them apart. I believe Pete has a

slightly projecting short rib on his left side—or is it Pup? It was

fatal to mistake.
"Hullo, Pup!" I would cry to one jovially.
"G—r—r—r—!" would remark the dog, retiring under the sofa. Thus I

would know it was Pete. The worst of it was that said Pete's feelings

were thereby lacerated so deeply that I was not forgiven all the rest of

that day.
Beyond the dogs lay a noble enclosure so large that it would have been

subdivided into building lots had it been anywhere else. It was

inhabited by all sorts of fowl, hundreds of them, of all varieties.

There were chickens, turkeys, geese, and a flock of ducks. The Captain

pointed out the Rouen ducks, almost exactly like the wild mallards.
"Those are my live decoys," said he.
For the accommodation of this multitude were cities of nest houses,

roost houses, and the like. Huge structures [Pg 244]elevated on poles swarmed

with doves. A duck pond even had been provided for its proper denizens.
Thus we reached the southernmost outpost of our quadrangle, and turned

to the west, where an ancient Chinaman and an assistant cultivated

minutely and painstakingly a beautiful vegetable garden. Tiny irrigation

streams ran here and there, fitted with miniature water locks. Strange

and foreign bamboo mattings, withes, and poles performed strange and

foreign functions. The gardener, brown and old and wrinkled, his cue

wound neatly beneath his tremendous, woven-straw umbrella of a hat,

possessing no English, no emotion, no single ray of the sort of

intelligence required to penetrate into our Occidental world, bent over

his work. When we passed, he did not look up. He dwelt in a shed. At

least, such it proved to be, when examined with the cold eye of

analysis. In impression it was ancient, exotic, Mongolian, the abode of

one of a mysterious and venerable race, a bit of foreign country. By

what precise means this was accomplished it would be difficult to say.

It is a fact well known to all Californians that a Chinaman can with no

more extensive properties than a few pieces of red paper, a partition, a

dingy curtain, and a varnished duck transform utterly an American

tenement into a Chinese pagoda.
Thence we passed through a wicket and came to the abode of hogs. They

dotted the landscape into the far distance, rooting about to find what

they could; they lay in wallows; they heaped themselves along fences;

they snorted and splashed in sundry shallow pools; a good half mile of

maternal hogs occupied a row of kennels from which the various progeny

issued forth between the bars. I cannot say I am [Pg 245]much interested in

hogs, but even I could dimly comprehend the Captain's attitude of

swollen pride. They were clean, and black, and more nearly approximated

the absurd hog advertisements than I had believed possible. You know the

kind I mean; an almost exact rectangle on four short legs.
In the middle distance stood a long, narrow, thatched roof supported on

poles. Beneath this, the Captain told me, were the beehives. They proved

later to be in charge of a mild-eyed religious fanatic who believed the

world to be flat.
We took a cursory glance at a barn filled to the brim with prunes; and

the gushing, beautiful artesian well; at the men's quarters; the

blacksmith shop, and all the rest. So we rounded the circle and came to

the most important single feature of the ranch—the quarters for the

horses.
A very long, deep shed, open on all sides, contained a double row of

mangers facing each other, and divided into stalls. Here stood and were

fed the working horses. By that I mean not only the mule and horse

teams, but also the utility driving teams and the saddle horses used by

the cowboys. Between each two stalls was a heavy pillar supporting the

roof, and well supplied with facilities for hanging up the harness and

equipments. As is usual in California, the sides and ends were open to

the air; and the floor was simply the earth well bedded.
But over against this shed stood a big barn of the Eastern type. Here

were the private equipments.
The Captain is a horseman. He breeds polo ponies after a formula of his

own; and so successfully that many of them cross the Atlantic. On the

ranch are always several hun[Pg 246]dred head of beautiful animals; and of

these the best are kept up for the use of the Captain and his friends.

We looked at them in their clean, commodious stalls; we inspected the

harness and saddle room, glistening and satiny with polished metal and

well-oiled leather; we examined the half dozen or so of vehicles of all

descriptions. The hostess told with relish of her one attempt to be

stylish.
"We had such beautiful horses," said she, "that I thought we ought to

have something to go with them, so I sent up to the city for my

brougham. It made a very neat turnout; and Tom was as proud of it as I

was, but when it came to a question of proper garb for Tom I ran up

against a deadlock. Tom refused point blank to wear a livery or anything

approaching a livery. He was perfectly respectful about it; but he

refused. Well, I drove around all that winter, when the weather was bad,

in a well-appointed brougham drawn by a good team in a proper harness;

and on the box sat a lean-faced cow puncher in sombrero, red

handkerchief, and blue jeans!"
Tom led forth the horses one after the other—Kingmaker, the Fiddler,

Pittapat, and the others. We spent a delightful two hours. The sun

dropped; the shadows lengthened. From the fields the men began to come

in. They drove the wagons and hay ricks into the spacious enclosure, and

set leisurely about the task of caring for their animals. Chinese and

Japanese drifted from the orchards, and began to manipulate the

grindstone on their pruning knives. Presently a cowboy jogged in, his

spurs and bit jingling. From the cook house a bell began to clang.
We turned back to the house. Before going in I faced [Pg 247]the west. The sky

had turned a light green full of lucence. The minor sounds of the ranch

near by seemed to be surrounded by a sea of silence outside. Single

sounds came very clearly across it. And behind everything, after a few

moments, I made out a queer, monotonous background of half-croaking

calling. For some time this puzzled me. Then at last my groping

recollection came to my assistance. I was hearing the calling of myriads

of snow geese.

[Pg 248]
CHAPTER IV
THE EARLY BIRD
I was awakened rather early by Redmond, who silently entered the room,

lit a kerosene stove, closed the windows, and departed. As I was now

beneath two blankets and an eiderdown quilt, and my nose was cold, I was

duly grateful. Mistaking the rite for a signal to arise, I did so; and

shortly descended. The three fireplaces were crackling away merrily, but

they had done little to mitigate the atmosphere as yet. Maids were

dusting and sweeping. The table was not yet set. Inquiry telling that

breakfast was more than an hour later, I took a gun from the rack,

pocketed the only five shells in sight, and departed to see what I could

see.
The outer world was crisp with frost. I clambered over the corral fence,

made my way through a hundred acres or so of slumbering pigs, and so

emerged into the open country.
In the middle distance and perhaps a mile away was a low fringe of

brush; to the left an equal distance a group of willows; and almost

behind me a clump of cottonwoods. I resolved to walk over to the brush,

swing around to the willows, turn to the cottonwoods, and so back to the

ranch. It looked like about four miles or so. Perhaps with my five

shells I might get something. At any rate, I would have a good walk.
[Pg 249]The mountains were turning from the rose pink of early morning. I could

hear again the bickering cries of the snow geese and sandhill cranes

away in an unknown distance, the homelier calls of barnyard fowl nearer

at hand. Cattle trotted before me and to right and left, their heads

high, their gait swinging with the freedom of the half-wild animals of

the ranges. After a few steps they turned to stare at me, eyes and

nostrils wide, before making up their minds whether or not it would be

wise to put a greater distance between me and them. The close sod was

green and strong. It covered the slightly rounding irrigation "checks"

that followed in many a curve and double the lines of contours on the

flat plain.
The fringe of brush did not amount to anything; it was merely a

convenient turning mark for my little walk. Arrived there, I executed a

sharp "column left——"
Seven ducks leaped into the air apparently from the bare, open, and dry

ground!
Every sportsman knows the scattering effect on the wits of the

absolutely unexpected appearance of game. Every sportsman knows also the

instinctive reactions that long habit will bring about. Thus,

figuratively, I stood with open mouth, heart beating slightly faster,

and mind making to itself such imbecile remarks as: "Well, what do you

think of that! Who in blazes would have expected ducks here?" and other

futile remarks. In the meantime, the trained part of me had jerked the

gun off my shoulder, pushed forward the safety catch, and prepared for

one hasty long shot at the last and slowest of the ducks. Now the

instinctive part of one can do the preparations, but the actual

[Pg 250]shooting requires a more ordered frame of mind. By this time my wits

had snapped back into place. I had the satisfaction of seeing the duck's

outstretched neck wilt; of hearing him hit the ground with a thud

somewhere beyond.
Marking the line of his fall, I stepped confidently forward, and without

any warning whatever found myself standing on the bank of an irrigation

ditch. It was filled to the brim with placid water on which floated a

few downy feathers. On this side was dry sod; and on the other was dry

sod. Nothing indicated the presence of that straight band of silvery

water until one stood fairly at its brink. To the right I could see its

sides narrow to the point of a remote perspective. To the left it ran

for a few hundred yards, then apparently came to an abrupt stop where it

turned at an angle.
In the meantime, my duck was on the other side; I was in my citizen's

clothes.
No solution offered in sight, so I made my way to the left where I could

look around the bend. Nearing the bend I was seized with a bright idea.

I dropped back below the line of sight, sneaked quietly to the bank,

and, my eye almost level with the water, peered down the new vista. Sure

enough, not a hundred and fifty yards away floated another band of

ducks.
I watched them for a moment until I was sure, by various small

landmarks, of their exact location. Then I dropped back far enough so

that, even standing erect, I would be below the line of vision of those

ducks; strolled along until opposite my landmarks; then, bolt upright,

[Pg 251]walked directly forward, the gun at ready. When within twenty yards the

ducks arose. It was, of course, easy shooting. Both fell across the

ditch. That did not worry me; if worst came to worst I could strip and

wade.
This seemed to be an exceedingly unique and interesting way to shoot

ducks. To be sure, I had only two shells left; but then, it must be

almost breakfast time. I repeated the feat a half mile farther on,

discovered a flood gate over which I could get to the other side,

collected my five ducks, and cut across country to the ranch. The sun

was just getting in its work on the frost. Long files of wagons and men

could be seen disappearing in the distance. I entered proudly, only ten

minutes late.

[Pg 252]
CHAPTER V
QUAIL
The family assembled took my statement with extraordinary calm,

contenting themselves with a general inquiry as to the species. I was

just a trifle crestfallen at this indifference. You see at this time I

was not accustomed to the casual duck. My shooting heretofore had been a

very strenuous matter. It had involved arising many hours before sun-up,

and venturing forth miles into wild marshes; and much endurance of cold

and discomfort. To make a bag of any sort we were in the field before

the folk knew the night had passed. Upland shooting meant driving long

distances, and walking through the heavy hardwood swamps and slashes

from dusk to dusk. Therefore I had considered myself in great luck to

have blundered upon my ducks so casually; and, furthermore, from the

family's general air of leisure and unpreparedness, jumped to the

conclusion that no field sport was projected for that day.
Mrs. Kitty presided beside a copper coffee pot with a bell-shaped glass

top. As this was also an institution, it merits attention. A small

alcohol lamp beneath was lighted. For a long time nothing happened. Then

all at once the glass dome clouded, was filled with frantic brown and

racing bubbling. Thereupon the hostess turned over a sand glass. When

the last grains had run through, the alcohol lamp was [Pg 253]turned off.

Immediately the glass dome was empty again. From a spigot one drew off

coffee.
But if perchance the Captain and I wished to get up before anybody else

could be hired to get up, the Dingbat could be so loaded as to give down

an automatic breakfast. The evening before the maid charged the affair

as usual, and at the last popped four eggs into the glass dome. After

the mysterious alchemical perturbations had ceased, we fished out those

eggs soft boiled to the second! One day the maid mistook the gasoline

bottle for the alcohol bottle. That is a sad tale having to do with

running flames, and burned table pieces, not to speak of a melted-down

connection or so on the Dingbat. We did not know what was the matter;

and our attitude was not so much that of alarm, as of grief and

indignation that our good old tried and trained Dingbat should in his

old age cut up any such didoes. Especially as there were new guests

present.
After breakfast we wandered out on the verandah. Nobody seemed to be in

any hurry to start anything. The hostess made remarks to

Pollymckittrick; the General read a newspaper; the Captain sauntered

about enjoying the sun. After fifteen minutes, as though the notion had

just occurred, somebody suggested that we go shooting.
"How about it?" the Captain asked me.
"Surely," I agreed, and added with some surprise out of my other

experience, "Isn't it a little late?"
But the Captain misunderstood me.
"I don't mean blind shooting," said he, "just ram around."
[Pg 254]He seized a megaphone and bellowed through it at the stables.
"Better get on your war paint," he suggested to me.
I changed hastily into my shooting clothes, and returned to the

verandah. After some few moments the Captain joined me. After some few

moments more a tremendous rattling came from the stable. A fine bay team

swung into the driveway, rounded the circle, and halted. It drew the

source of the tremendous rattling.
Thus I became acquainted with the Liver Invigorator. The Invigorator was

a buckboard high, wide, and long. It had one wide seat. Aft of that seat

was a cage with bars, in which old Ben rode. Astern was a deep box

wherein one carried rubber boots, shells, decoys, lunch, game, and the

like. The Invigorator was very old, very noisy, and very able. With it

we drove cheerfully anywhere we pleased—over plowed land, irrigation

checks, through brush thick enough to lift our wheels right off the

ground, and down into and out of water ditches so steep that we

alternately stood the affair on its head and its tail, and so deep that

we had to hold all our belongings in our arms, while old Ben stuck his

nose out the top bars of his cage for a breath of air. It could not be

tipped over; at least we never upset it. To offset these virtues it

rattled like a runaway milk wagon; and it certainly hit the high spots

and hit them hard. Nevertheless, in a long and strenuous sporting

career the Invigorator became endeared through association to many

friends. When the Captain proposed a new vehicle with easier springs and

less noise, a [Pg 255]wail of protest arose from many and distant places. The

Invigorator still fulfills its function.
Now there are three major topics on the Ranch: namely, ducks, quail, and

ponies. In addition to these are five of minor interest: the mail,

cattle, jackrabbits, coons, and wildcats.
I was already familiar with the valley quail, for I had hunted him since

I was a small boy with the first sixteen-gauge gun ever brought to the

coast. I knew him for a very speedy bird, much faster than our bob

white, dwelling in the rounded sagebrush hills, travelling in flocks of

from twenty to several thousand, exceedingly given to rapid leg work. We

had to climb hard after him, and shoot like lightning from insecure

footing. His idiosyncrasies were as strongly impressed on me as the fact

that human beings walk upright. Here, however, I had to revise my ideas.
We drove down the avenue of palms, pursued by four or five yapping

dachshunds, and so out into a long, narrow lane between pasture fences.

Herds of ponies, fuzzy in their long winter coats, came gently to look

at us. The sun was high now, so the fur of their backs lay flat. Later,

in the chill of evening, the hair would stand out like the nap of

velvet, thus providing for additional warmth by the extra air space

between the outside of the coat and the skin. It must be very handy to

carry this invisible overcoat, ready for the moment's need. Here, too,

were cattle standing about. On many of them I recognized the familiar

J-I brand of many of my Arizona experiences. Arizona bred and raised

them; California fattened them for market. [Pg 256]We met a cowboy jingling by

at his fox trot; then came to the country road.
Along this we drove for some miles. The country was perfectly flat, but

variegated by patches of greasewood, of sagebrush, of Egyptian-corn

fields, and occasionally by a long, narrow fringe of trees. Here, too,

were many examples of that phenomenon so vigorously doubted by most

Easterners: the long rows of trees grown from original cotton wood or

poplar fence posts. In the distance always were the mountains. Overhead

the sky was very blue. A number of buzzards circled.
After a time we turned off the road and into a country covered over with

tumbleweed, a fine umber red growth six or eight inches high, and

scattered sagebrush. Inlets, bays, and estuaries of bare ground ran

everywhere. The Captain stood up to drive, watching for the game to

cross these bare places.
I stood up, too. It is no idle feat to ride the Invigorator thus over

hummocky ground. It lurched and bumped and dropped into and out of

trouble; and in correspondence I alternately rose up and sat down again,

hard. The Captain rode the storm without difficulty. He was accustomed

to the Invigorator; and, too, he had the reins to hang on by.
"There they go!" said he, suddenly, bringing the team to a halt.
I looked ahead. Across a ten-foot barren ran the quail, their crests

cocked forward, their trim figures held close as a sprinter goes, rank

after rank, their heads high in the alert manner of quail.
The Captain sat down, jerked off the brake, and spoke to [Pg 257]his horses. I

sat down, too; mainly because I had to. The Invigorator leaped from hump

to hump. Before those quail knew it we were among them. Right, left, all

around us they roared into the air. Some doubled back; some buzzed low

to right or left; others rose straight ahead to fly a quarter mile, and

then, wings set, to sail another quarter until finally they pitched down

into some bit of inviting cover.
The Captain brought his horses to a stand with great satisfaction. We

congratulated each other gleefully; and even old Ben, somewhat shaken up

in his cage astern, wagged his tail in appreciation of the situation.
For, you see, we had scattered the covey, and now they would lie. If the

band had flushed, flown, and lighted as one body, immediately on hitting

the ground they would have put their exceedingly competent little legs

into action, and would have run so well and so far that, by the time we

had arrived on the spot, they would have been a good half mile away. But

now that the covey was broken, the individuals and small bands would

stay put. If they ran at all, it would be for but a short distance. On

this preliminary scattering depends the success of a chase after

California quail. I have seen six or eight men empty both barrels of

their guns at a range of more than a hundred yards. They were not insane

enough to think they would get anything. Merely they hoped that the

racket and the dropping of the spent shot would break the distant covey.
We hitched the horses to a tree, released old Ben, and started forth.
For a half hour we had the most glorious sport, beating [Pg 258]back and forth

over the ground again and again. The birds lay well in the low cover,

and the shooting was clean and open. I soon found that the edges of the

bare ground were the most likely places. Apparently the birds worked

slowly through the cover ahead of us, but hesitated to cross the open

spots, and so bunched at the edge. By walking in a zigzag along some of

these borders, we gathered in many scattered birds and small bunches.

Why the zigzag? Naturally it covers a trifle more ground than a straight

course, but principally it seems to confuse the game. If you walk in a

straight line, so the quail can foretell your course, it is very apt

either to flush wild or to hide so close that you pass it by. The zigzag

fools it.
Thus, with varying luck, we made a slow circle back to the wagon. Here

we found Mrs. Kitty and Carrie and the lunch awaiting us with the

ponies.
These robust little animals were not miniature horses, but genuine

ponies, with all the deviltry, endurance, and speed of their kind. They

were jet-black, about waist high, and of great intelligence. They drew a

neat little rig, capable of accommodating two, at a persistent rapid

patter that somehow got over the road at a great gait. And they could

keep it up all day. Although perfectly gentle, they were as alert as

gamins for mischief, and delighted hugely in adding to the general row

and confusion if anything happened to go wrong. Mrs. Kitty drove them

everywhere. One day she attempted to cross an irrigation ditch that

proved to be deeper than she had thought it. The ponies disappeared

utterly, leaving Mrs. Kitty very much astonished. Horses would have

drowned [Pg 259]in like circumstances, but the ponies, nothing daunted, dug in

their hoofs and scrambled out like a pair of dogs, incidentally dipping

their mistress on the way.
In the shade of a high greasewood we unpacked the pony carriage. This

was before the days of thermos bottles, so we had a most elaborate

wicker basket whose sides let down to form a wind shield protecting an

alcohol burner and a kettle. When the water boiled, we made hot tea, and

so came to lunch.
Strangely enough this was my first experience at having lunch brought

out to the field. Ordinarily we had been accustomed to carry a sandwich

or so in the side pockets of our shooting coats, which same we ate at

any odd moment that offered. Now was disclosed an astonishing variety.

There were sandwiches, of course, and a salad, and the tea, but

wonderful to contemplate was a deep dish of potted quail, row after row

of them, with delicious white sauce. In place of the frugal bite or so

that would have left us alert and fit for an afternoon's work, we ate

until nothing remained. Then we lit pipes and lay on our backs, and

contemplated a cloudless sky. It was the warm time of day. The horses

snoozed, a hind leg tucked up; old Ben lay outstretched in doggy

content; Mrs. Kitty knit or crocheted or something of that sort; and

Carrie and the Captain and I took cat naps. At length, the sun's rays no

longer striking warm from overhead, the Captain aroused us sternly.
"You're a nice, energetic, able lot of sportsmen!" he cried with

indignation. "Have I got to wait until sunset for you lazy chumps to get

a full night's rest?"
[Pg 260]"Don't mind him," Mrs. Kitty told me, placidly; "he was sound asleep

himself; and the only reason he waked is because he snored and I

punched him."
She folded up her fancy work, shook out her skirts, and turned to the

ponies.
It was now late in the afternoon. We had disgracefully wasted our time,

and enjoyed doing it. The Captain decided it to be too late to hunt up a

new covey, so we reversed to pick up some of those that had originally

doubled back. We flushed forty or fifty of them at the edge of the road.

They scattered ahead of us in a forty-acre plowed field.
Until twilight, then, we walked leisurely back and forth, which is the

only way to walk in a plowed field, after all. The birds had pitched

down into the old furrows, and whenever a tuft of grass, a piece of

tumbleweed, or a shallow grassy ditch offered a handful of cover, there

the game was to be found. Mrs. Kitty followed at the Captain's elbow,

and Carrie at mine. Carrie made a first-rate dog, marking down the birds

unerringly. The quail flew low and hard, offering in the gathering

twilight and against the neutral-coloured earth marks worthy of good

shooting. At last we turned back to our waiting team. The dusk was

coming over the land, and the "shadow of the earth" was marking its

strange blue arc in the east. As usual the covey was now securely

scattered. Of a thousand or so birds we had bagged forty-odd; and yet of

the remainder we would have had difficulty in flushing another dozen. It

is the mystery of the quail, and one that the sportsman can never

completely comprehend. As we clambered into [Pg 261]the Invigorator we could

hear from all directions the birds signalling each other. Near, far, to

right, to left, the call sounded, repeating over and over again a

parting, defiant denial that the victory was ours.
"You can't shoot! You can't shoot! You can't shoot!"
And nearer at hand the contented chirping twitter as the covey found

itself.

[Pg 262]
CHAPTER VI
PONIES
Next morning the Captain decided that he had various affairs to attend

to, so we put on our riding clothes and went down to the stables.
The Captain had always forty or fifty polo ponies in the course of

education, and he was delighted to have them ridden, once he was

convinced of your seat and hands. They were beautiful ponies, generally

iron gray in colour, very friendly, very eager, and very lively. Riding

them was like flying through the air, for they sailed over rough ground,

irrigation checks, and the like without a break in their stride, and

without a jar. By the same token it was necessary to ride them. At odd

moments they were quite likely to give a wide sidewise bound or a

stiff-legged buck from sheer joy of life. One got genuine "horse

exercise" out of them.
The Captain, as perhaps I have said, invented these ponies himself. From

Chihuahua he brought in some of the best mustang mares he could find;

and, in case you have Frederick Remington's pictures of starved

winter-range animals in mind, let me tell you a good mustang is a very

handsome animal indeed. These he bred to a thoroughbred. The resulting

half-breeds grew to the proper age. Then he started to have them broken

to the saddle. A start was as far as he ever got, for nobody could ride

them. [Pg 263]They combined the intelligence and vice of the mustang with the

endurance and nervous instability of the thoroughbred. The Captain tried

all sorts of men, even sending at last to Arizona for a good bronco

buster on the J-I. Only one or two of the many could back the animals at

all, though many aspirants made a try at it. After a long series of

experiments, the Captain came to the reluctant conclusion that the cross

was no good. It seemed a pity, for they were beautiful animals, up to

full polo size, deep chested, strong shouldered, close coupled, and

speedy.
Then, by way of idleness, he bred some of the half-bred mares. The

three-quarter cross proved to be ideal. They were gentle, easily broken,

and to the eye differed in no particular from their pure-blooded

brothers. So, ever since, the Captain has been raising these most

excellent polo ponies to his great honour and profit and the incidental

pleasure of his friends who like riding.
One of these ponies was known as the Merry Jest. He had a terrifying but

harmless trick. The moment the saddle was cinched, down went his head

and he began to buck in the most vicious style. This he would keep up

until further orders. In order to put an end to the performance all one

had to do was to haul in on the rope, thrust one's foot in the stirrup,

and clamber aboard. For, mark you this, Merry Jest in the course of a

long and useful life never failed to buck under the empty saddle—and

never bucked under a rider!
This, of course, constituted the Merry Jest. Its beauty was that it was

so safe.
"Want to ride?" asked the Captain.
[Pg 264]"Surely," replied the unsuspecting stranger.
The Merry Jest was saddled, brought forth, and exhibited in action.
"There's your horse," remarked the Captain in a matter-of-course tone.
We rode out the corral gate and directly into the open country. The

animals chafed to be away; and when we loosened the reins, leaped

forward in long bounds. Over the rough country they skimmed like

swallows, their hoofs hardly seeming to touch the ground, the powerful

muscles playing smoothly beneath us like engines. After a mile of this

we pulled up, and set about the serious business of the day.
One after another we oversaw all the major activities of such a ranch;

outside, I mean, of the ranch enclosure proper where were the fowls, the

vegetable gardens, and the like. Here an immense hay rick was being

driven slowly along while two men pitched off the hay to right and left.

After it followed a long line of cattle. This manner of feeding obviated

the crowding that would have taken place had the hay not been thus

scattered. The more aggressive followed close after the rick, snatching

mouthfuls of the hay as it fell. The more peaceful, or subdued, or

philosophical strung out in a long, thin line, eating steadily at one

spot. They got more hay with less trouble, but the other fellows had to

maintain reputations for letting nobody get ahead of them!
At another point an exceedingly rackety engine ran a hay press, where

the constituents of one of the enormous house-like haystacks were fed

into a hopper and came out neatly [Pg 265]baled. A dozen or so men oversaw the

activities of this noisy and dusty machine.
Down by the northerly cottonwoods two miles away we found other men with

scrapers throwing up the irrigation checks along the predetermined

contour lines. By means of these irregular meandering earthworks the

water, admitted from the ditch to the upper end of the field, would work

its way slowly from level to level instead of running off or making

channels for itself. This job, too, was a dusty one. We could see the

smoke of it rising from a long distance; and the horses and men were

brown with it.
And again we rode softly for miles over greensward through the cattle,

at a gentle fox trot, so as not to disturb them. At several points stood

great blue herons, like sentinels, decorative as a Japanese screen,

absolutely motionless. The Captain explained that they were "fishing"

for gophers; and blessed them deeply. Sometimes our mounts splashed for

a long distance through water five or six inches shallow. Underneath the

surface we could see the short green grass of the turf that thus

received its refreshment. Then somewhere near, silhouetted against the

sky or distant mountains, on the slight elevation of the irrigation

ditch bank, we were sure to see some of the irrigation Chinamen. They

were strange, exotic figures, their skins sunburned and dark, their

queues wound around their heads; wearing always the same uniform of blue

jeans cut China-fashion, rubber boots, and the wide, inverted bowl

Chinese sun hat of straw. By means of shovels wherewith to dig, and iron

bars wherewith to raise and lower flood gates, they controlled the

artificial rainfall of the region. [Pg 266]So accustomed did the ducks become

to these amphibious people that they hardly troubled themselves to get

out of the way, and were utterly careless of how near they flew. Uncle

Jim once disguised himself as an irrigation Chinaman and got all kinds

of shooting—until the ducks found him out. Now they seem able to

distinguish accurately between a Chinaman with a long shovel and a white

man with a shotgun, no matter how the latter is dressed. Ducks, tame and

wild, have a lot of sense. It must bore the former to be forced to

associate with chickens.
Over in the orchard, of a thousand acres or so, were many more

Orientals, and hundreds of wild doves. These Chinese were all of the

lower coolie orders, and primitive, not to say drastic in their medical

ideas. One evening the Captain heard a fine caterwauling and drum

beating over in the quarters, and sallied forth to investigate. In one

of the huts he found four men sitting on the outspread legs and arms of

a fifth. The latter had been stripped stark naked. A sixth was engaged

in placing live coals on the patient's belly, while assorted assistants

furnished appropriate music and lamentation. The Captain put a stop to

the proceedings and bundled the victim to a hospital where he promptly

died. It was considered among Chinese circles that the Captain had

killed him by ill-timed interference!
Everywhere we went, and wherever a small clump of trees or even large

brush offered space, hung the carcasses of coyotes, wildcats, and lynx.

Some were quite new, while others had completely mummified in the dry

air of these interior plains. These were the trophies of the

professional [Pg 267]"varmint killer," a man hired by the month. Of course it

would be only too easy for such an official to loaf on his job, so this

one had adopted the unique method of proving his activity. Everywhere

the Captain rode he could see that his man had been busy.
All this time we had been working steadily away from the ranch. Long

zigzags and side trips carried us little forward, and a constant

leftward tendency swung us always around, until we had completed a half

circle of which the ranch itself was the centre. The irrigated fields

had given place to open country of a semi-desert character grown high

with patches of greasewood, sagebrush, thorn-bush; with wide patches of

scattered bunch grass; and stretches of alkali waste. Here, unexpectedly

to me, we stumbled on a strange but necessary industry incidental to so

large an estate. Our nostrils were assailed by a mighty stink. We came

around the corner of some high brush directly on a small two-story

affair with a factory smokestack. It was fenced in, and the fence was

covered with drying hides. I will spare you details, but the function of

the place was to make glue, soap, and the like of those cattle whose

term of life was marked by misfortune rather than by the butcher's

knife. The sole workman at this economical and useful occupation did not

seem to mind it. The Captain claimed he was as good as a buzzard at

locating the newly demised.
Our ponies did not like the place either. They snorted violently, and

pricked their ears back and forth, and were especially relieved and

eager to obey when we turned their heads away.
We rode on out into the desert, our ponies skipping ex[Pg 268]pertly through

the low brush and gingerly over the alkali crust of the open spaces

beneath which might be holes. Jackrabbits by the thousand, literally,

hopped away in front of us, spreading in all directions as along the

sticks of a fan. They were not particularly afraid, so they loped easily

in high-bounding leaps, their ears erect. Many of them sat bolt upright,

looking at least two feet high. Occasionally we managed really to scare

one, and then it was a grand sight to see him open the throttle and scud

away, his ears flat back, in the classical and correct attitude of the

constantly recurring phrase of the ancients: "belly to earth he flew!"
Jackrabbits are a great nuisance. The Captain had to enclose his

precious alfalfa fields with rabbit-proof wire to prevent utter

destruction. There was a good deal of fence, naturally, and occasionally

the inquiring rabbit would find a hole and crawl through. Then he was in

alfalfa, which is, as every Californian knows, much better than being in

clover. He ate at first greedily, then more daintily, wandering always

farther afield in search of dessert. Never, however, did he forget the

precise location of the opening by which he had entered, as was wise of

him. For now, behold, enter the dogs. Ordinarily these dogs, who were

also wise beasts, passed by the jackrabbit in his abundance with only

inhibited longing. Their experience had taught them that to chase

jackrabbits in the open with any motive ulterior to that of healthful

exercise and the joy of seeing the blame things run was as vain and as

puppish as chasing one's tail. But in the alfalfa fields was a chance,

for it must be remembered that such fields were [Pg 269]surrounded by the

rabbit-proof wire in which but a single opening was known to the jack in

question. Therefore, with huge delight, the dogs gave chase. Mr. Rabbit

bolted back for his opening, his enemies fairly at his heels. Now comes

the curious part of the episode. The dogs knew perfectly well that if

the rabbit hit the hole in the fence he was safe for all of them; and

they had learned, further, that if the rabbit missed his plunge for

safety he would collide strongly with that tight-strung wire. When

within twenty feet or so of the fence they stopped short in expectation.

Probably three times out of five the game made his plunge in safety and

scudded away over the open plain outside. Then the dogs turned and

trotted philosophically back to the ranch. But the other two times the

rabbit would miss. At full speed he would hit the tight-strung mesh,

only to be hurled back by its resiliency fairly into the jaws of his

waiting pursuers. Though thousands may consider this another

nature-fake, I shall always have the comfort of thinking that the

Captain and the dogs know it for the truth.
At times jackrabbits get some sort of a plague and die in great numbers.

Indeed some years at the ranch they seemed almost to have disappeared.

Their carcasses are destroyed almost immediately by the carrion

creatures, and their delicate bones, scattered by the ravens, buzzards,

and coyotes, soon disintegrate and pass into the soil. One does not find

many evidences of the destruction that has been at work; yet he will see

tens instead of myriads. I have been at the ranch when one was never out

of sight of jackrabbits, in droves, and again I have been there when

[Pg 270]one would not see a half dozen in a morning's ride. They recover their

numbers fast enough, and the chances are that this "narrow-gauge mule"

will be always with us. The ranchman would like nothing better than to

bid him a last fond but genuine farewell; but I should certainly miss

him.
The greasewood and thorn-bush grew in long, narrow patches. The ragweed

grew everywhere it pleased, affording grand cover for the quail. The

sagebrush occurred singly at spaced intervals, with tiny bare spaces

between across which the plumed little rascals scurried hurriedly. The

tumbleweed banked high wherever, in the mysterious dispensations of

Providence, a call for tumbleweed had made itself heard.
The tumbleweed is a curious vegetable. It grows and flourishes amain,

and becomes great even as a sagebrush, and puts forth its blossoms and

seeds, and finally turns brown and brittle. Just about as you would

conclude it has reached a respectable old age and should settle down by

its chimney corner, it decides to go travelling. The first breath of

wind that comes along snaps it off close to the ground. The next turns

it over. And then, inasmuch as the tumbleweed is roughly globular in

shape, some three or four feet in diameter, and exceedingly light in

structure, over and over it rolls across the plain! If the wind happens

to increase, the whole flock migrates, bounding merrily along at a good

rate of speed. Nothing more terrifying to the unaccustomed equine can be

imagined than thirty or forty of these formidable-looking monsters

charging down upon him, bouncing several feet from the surface of the

earth. The experienced horse treats them [Pg 271]with the contempt such

light-minded senility deserves, and wades through their phantom attack

indifferent. After the breeze has died the debauched old tumbleweeds are

everywhere to be seen, piled up against brush, choking the ditches,

filling the roads. Their beautiful spherical shapes have been frayed out

so that they look sodden and weary and done up. But their seeds have

been scattered abroad over the land.
Wherever we found water, there we found ducks. The irrigating ditches

contained many bands of a dozen or fifteen; the overflow ponds had each

its little flock. The sky, too, was rarely empty of them; and the cries

of the snow geese and the calls of sandhill cranes were rarely still. I

remarked on this abundance.
"Ducks!" replied the Captain, wonderingly. "Why, you haven't begun to

see ducks! Come with me."
Thereupon we turned sharp to the left. After ten minutes I made out from

a slight rise above the plain a black patch lying across the distance.

It seemed to cover a hundred acres or so, and to represent a sort of

growth we had not before encountered.
"That," said the Captain, indicating, "is a pond covered with ducks."
I did not believe it. We dropped below the line of sight and rode

steadily forward.
All at once a mighty roar burst on our ears, like the rush of a heavy

train over a high trestle; and immediately the air ahead of us was

filled with ducks towering. They mounted, and wheeled, and circled back

or darted away. The sky became fairly obscured with them in the sense

that it [Pg 272]seemed inconceivable that hither space could contain another

bird. Before the retina of the eye they swarmed exactly as a nearer

cloud of mosquitoes would appear.
Hardly had the shock of this first stupendous rise of wildfowl spent

itself before another and larger flight roared up. It seemed that all

the ducks in the world must be a-wing; and yet, even after that, a third

body arose, its rush sounding like the abrupt, overwhelming noise of a

cataract in a sudden shift of wind. I should be afraid to guess how many

ducks had been on that lake. Its surface was literally covered, so that

nowhere did a glint of water show. I suppose it would be a simple matter

to compute within a few thousand how many ducks would occupy so much

space; but of what avail? Mere numbers would convey no impression of the

effect. Rather fill the cup of heaven with myriads thick as a swarm of

gnats against the sun. They swung and circled back and forth before

making up their minds to be off, crossing and recrossing the various

lines of flight. The first thrice-repeated roar of rising had given

place to the clear, sustained whistling of wings, low, penetrating,

inspiring. In the last flight had been a band of several hundred snow

geese; and against the whiteness of their plumage the sun shone.
"That," observed the Captain with conviction, "is what you might call

ducks."
By now it was the middle of the afternoon. We had not thought of lunch.

At the ranch lunch was either a major or a minor consideration; there

was no middle ground. If possible, we ate largely of many most delicious

things. If, on the other hand, we happened to be out somewhere at [Pg 273]noon,

we cheerfully omitted lunch. So, when we returned to the ranch, the

Captain, after glancing at his watch and remarking that it was rather

late to eat, proposed that we try out two other ponies with the polo

mallets.
This we proceeded to do. After an hour's pleasant exercise on the flat

in the "Enclosure," we jogged contentedly back into the corral.
Around the corner of the barn sailed a distracted and utterly stampeded

hen. After her, yapping eagerly, came five dachshunds.
Pause and consider the various elements of outrage the situation

presented. (A) Dachshunds are, as before quoted, a bunch of useless,

bandylegged, snip-nosed, waggle-eared——, anyway, and represent an

amiable good-natured weakness on the part of Mrs. Kitty. (B) Dachshunds

in general are not supposed to run wild all over the place, but to

remain in their perfectly good, sufficiently large, entirely comfortable

corral, Pete and Pup excepted. (C) Chickens are valuable. (D) Confound

'em! This sort of a performance will be a bad example for Young Ben.

First thing we'll know, he'll be chasing chickens, too!
The Captain dropped from his pony and joined the procession. The hen

could run just a trifle faster than the dachshunds; and the dachshunds

just a trifle faster than the Captain. I always claimed they circled the

barn three times, in the order named. The Captain insists with dignity

that I exaggerate three hundred per cent. At any rate, the hen finally

blundered, the dachshunds fell upon her—and the Captain swung his polo

mallet.
[Pg 274]Five typical "sickening thuds" were heard; five dachshunds literally

sailed through the air to fall in quivering heaps. The Captain, his

anger cooled, came back, shaking his head.
"I wouldn't have killed those dogs for anything in the world!" he

muttered half to me, half to himself as we took the path to the house.

"I don't know what Mrs. Kitty will say to this! I certainly am sorry

about it!" and so on, at length.
We turned the corner of the hedge. There in a row on the top step of the

verandah sat five dachshunds, their mouths open in a happy smile, six

inches of pink tongue hanging, their eyes half closed in good-humoured

appreciation.
The Captain approached softly and looked them over with great care. He

felt of their ribs. He stared up at me incredulously.
"Is this the same outfit?" he whispered.
"It is," said I, "I know the blaze-face brute."
"But—but——"
"They played 'possum on you, Captain."
The Captain arose and his wrath exploded.
"You miserable hounds!" he roared.
With a wise premonition they decamped.
"I'm going to clean out the whole bandylegged tribe!" threatened the

Captain for the fiftieth time in the month. "I won't have them on the

ranch!"
That was seven years ago. They are still there—they and numerous

descendants.[G]

[Pg 275]
CHAPTER VII
DINNER
We washed up and came down stairs. All at once it proved to be drowsy

time. The dark had fallen and the lamps were lit. A new fire crackled in

the fireplace, anticipating the chill that was already descending.

Carrie played the piano in the other room. The General snorted over

something in his city paper. Mrs. Kitty had disappeared on household

business. Pete and Pup, having been mistaken one for the other by some

innocent bystander, gloomed and glowered under chairs.
Both the Captain and myself made some sort of a pretence of reading the

papers. It was only a pretence. The grateful warmth, the soothing

crackling of the fire, the distant music—and, possibly, our state of

starvation—lulled us to a half doze. From this we were aroused by an

announcement of dinner.
We had soup and various affairs of that sort; and there was brought on a

huge and baronial roast, from which the Captain promptly proceeded to

slice generous allowances. With it came vegetables. They were all cooked

in cream; not milk, but rich top cream thick enough to cut with a knife.

I began to see why all the house servants were plump. Also there were

jellies, and little fat hot rolls, [Pg 276]and strange pickled products of the

soil. I was good and hungry; and I ate thereof.
The plates were removed. I settled back with a sigh of repletion——
The door opened to admit the waitress bearing a huge platter on which

reposed, side by side, five ducks. That meant a whole one apiece! To my

feeble protest the family turned indignantly.
"Of course you must eat your duck!" Mrs. Kitty settled the whole

question at last.
So I ate my duck. It was a very good duck; as indeed it should have

been, for it was fattened on Egyptian corn, hung the exact number of

days, and cooked by Charley. It had a little spout of celery down which

I could pour the abundant juice from its inside; and it was flanked

right and left respectively by a piece of lemon liberally sprinkled with

red pepper and sundry crisp slabs of fried hominy. Every night of the

shooting season each member of the household had "his duck." Later I was

shown the screened room wherein hung the game, each dated by a little

tag.
After I had made way with most of my duck, and other things, and had had

my coffee, and had lighted a cigar, I was entirely willing to sink back

to disgraceful ease. But the Captain suddenly developed an inexcusable

and fiendish energy.
"No, you don't," said he. "You come with me and Redmond and get out the

decoys."
"What for?" I temporized, feebly.
"To keep the moths out of them, of course," replied the Captain with

fine sarcasm. "Do you mean to tell me that [Pg 277]you can sit still and do

nothing after seeing all those ducks this afternoon? You're a fine

sportsman! Brace up!"
"Let me finish this excellent cigar," I pleaded. "You gave it to me."
To this he assented. Carrie went back to the piano. The lights were dim.

Mrs. Kitty went on finishing her crochet work or whatever it was. Nobody

said anything for a long time. The Captain was busy in the gun room with

one of the ranch foremen.
But this could not last, and at length I was haled forth to work.
The crisp, sharp air beneath the frosty stars, after the tepid air

within, awakened me like the shock of cold water. Redmond was awaiting

us with a lantern. By the horse block lay the mass of something

indeterminate which I presently saw to be sacks full of something

knobby.
"I have six sacks of wooden decoys," said Redmond, "with weights all on

them."
The Captain nodded and passed on. We made our way down past the grape

arbour, opened the high door leading into chickenville, and stopped at

the border of the little pond. On its surface floated a hundred or so

tame ducks of all descriptions. By means of clods of earth we woke them

up. They came ashore and waddled without objection to a little

inclosure. We followed them and shut the gate.
One after another the Captain indicated those he wished to take with him

on the morrow. Redmond caught them, inserted them in gunny sacks, two to

the sack. They made no great objection to being caught. One or two

youngsters [Pg 278]flopped and flapped about, and had to be chased into a

corner. In general, however, they accepted the situation

philosophically, and snuggled down contentedly in their sacks.
"They are used to it," the Captain explained. "Most of these Rouen ducks

are old hands at the business; they know what to expect."
He was very particular as to the colouring of the individuals he

selected. A single white feather was sufficient to cause the rejection

of a female; and even when the colour scheme was otherwise perfect, too

light a shade proved undesired.
"I don't know just why it is," said he, "but the wild ducks are a lot

more particular about the live decoys than about the wooden. A wooden

decoy can be all knocked to pieces, faded and generally disreputable,

but it does well enough; but a live decoy must look the part absolutely.

That gives us six apiece; I think it will be enough."
Redmond took charge of our capture. We left him with the lantern,

stowing away the decoys, live and inanimate, in the Invigorator. Within

fifteen minutes thereafter I was sleeping the sleep of the moderately

tired and the fully fed.

[Pg 279]
CHAPTER VIII
DUCKS
The Captain rapped on my door. It was pitch dark, and the wind, which

had arisen during the night, was sweeping through the open windows,

blowing the light curtains about. Also it was very cold.
"All right," I answered, took my resolution in my hands, and stepped

forth.
Ten minutes later, by the light of a single candle, we were manipulating

the coffee-and-egg machine, and devouring the tall pile of

bread-and-butter sandwiches that had been left for us over night. Then,

stepping as softly as we could in our clumping rubber boots, our arms

burdened with guns and wraps, we stole into the outer darkness.
It was almost black, but we could dimly make out the treetops whipped

about by the wind. Over by the stable we caught the intermittent flashes

of many lanterns where the teamsters were feeding their stock. Presently

a merry and vigorous rattle—rattle—rattle arose and came nearer.

The Invigorator was ready and under way.
We put on all the coats and sweaters, and climbed aboard. The Captain

spoke to his horses, and we were off.
That morning I had my first experience of a phenomenon I have never

ceased admiring—and wondering at. I refer to the Captain's driving in

the dark.
[Pg 280]The night was absolutely black, so that I could hardly make out the

horses. In all the world were only two elements, the sky full of stars

and the mass of the earth. The value of this latter, as a means of

showing us where we were, was nullified by the fact that the skyline

consisted, not of recognizable and serviceable landmarks, but of the

distant mountains. We went a certain length of time, and bumped over a

certain number of things. Then the Captain pulled his team sharp around

to the left. Why he did so I could not tell you. We drove an hour over a

meandering course.
"Hang tight," remarked the Captain.
I did so. The front end of the Invigorator immediately fell away from

under me, so that if I had not been obeying orders by hanging tight I

should most certainly have plunged forward against the horses. We seemed

to slide and slither down a steep declivity, then hit water with a

splash, and began to flounder forward. The water rose high enough to

cover the floor of the Invigorator, causing the Captain to speculate on

whether Redmond had packed in the shells properly. Then the bow rose

with a mighty jerk and we scrambled out the other side.
"That's the upper ford on the Slough," observed the Captain, calmly.
Everywhere else along the Slough, as I subsequently discovered, the

banks fell off perpendicular, the water was deep, and the bottom soft.

The approach was down no fenced lane, but across the open, with no other

landmarks even in daylight than the break of low willows and

cotton[Pg 281]woods exactly like a hundred others. Ten minutes later the

Captain drew rein.
"Here you are," said he, cautiously. "You can dump your stuff off right

here. I can't get through the fence with the team; but it's only a short

distance to carry."
Accordingly, in entire faith, I descended and unloaded my three sacks of

wooden decoys and my three sacks of live ducks and my gun and shells.
"I'll drive on to another hole," said the Captain. "Good luck!"
"Would you mind," I suggested, meekly, "telling me in which direction

this mythical fence is situated; what kind of a fence it is; and where I

carry to when I get through it?"
The Captain chuckled.
"Why," he explained, "the fence is straight ahead of you; and it's

barbed wire; and as for where you're headed, you'll find the pond where

we saw all those ducks last night about a hundred yards or so west."
Where we saw all those ducks! My blood increased its pace through my

veins. Now that I was afoot, I could begin to make out things in the

starlight—the silhouettes of bushes or brush, and even three or four

posts of the fence.
The Invigorator rattled into the distance. I got my stuff the other side

of the wires, and, shouldering a sack, plodded away due west.
But now I made out the pond gleaming; and by this and by the dim

grayness of the earth immediately about me knew that dawn was at last

under way. The night had not [Pg 282]yet begun to withdraw, but its first

strength was going. Objects in the world about became, not visible, but

existent. By the time I had carried my last load the rather liberal

hundred yards to the shores of the pond the eastern sky had banished its

stars.
My movements had, of course, alarmed the ducks. There were not many of

them, as I could judge by the whistling of their departing wings and by

the silvery furrows where they had left the water. It is curious how

strong the daylight must become before the eye can distinguish a duck in

flight. The comparative paucity of numbers, I reflected, was probably

due to the fact that the ducks used this pond merely as a loafing place

during the day. Therefore I should anticipate a good flight as soon as

feeding time should be over; especially as one end of the pond proved to

be fairly well sheltered from the high wind.
At once I set to work to build me a blind. This I constructed of

tumbleweed and willow shoots, with a lucky sagebrush as a good basis. I

made it thick below and thin on top, so I could crouch hidden, and rise

easily to shoot. Also I made it hastily, working away with a

concentration that would prove very valuable could it be brought to a

useful line of work. There can nothing equal the busyness of a man

hastening to perfect his arrangements before a flight of ducks is due to

start. Every few moments I would look anxiously up to see how things

were going with the morning. The light was indubitably increasing. That

is to say, I could make out the whole width of the pond, for example,

although the farther banks were still in silhouette, and the sky was

almost free of stars. Also the perpendicu[Pg 283]lar plane of the mountains to

the west, in some subtle manner, was beginning to break. It was not yet

daylight; but the dawn was here.
I reached cautiously into one of the sacks and brought forth one of the

decoy ducks. Around his neck I buckled a little leather collar to a ring

in which had been attached a cord and weight. Then I cautiously waded

out and anchored him.
He was delighted, and proceeded immediately to take a bath, ducking his

head under and out again, ruffling his wings, and wagging his absurd

little tail. Apparently the whole experience was a matter of course to

him; but he was willing to show pleasure that this phase of it was over.

I anchored out his five companions, and then proceeded to arrange the

wooden decoys artistically around the outskirts. By now it was quite

genuinely early daylight. Three times the overhead whistle of wings had

warned me to hurry; and twice small flocks of ducks had actually swung

down within range only to discover me at the last moment and tower away

again. When younger, I used, at such junctures, to rush for my gun. That

is a puppy stage, for by the time you get your gun those ducks are gone;

and by the time you have regained your abandoned task more ducks are in.

Therefore one early learns that when he goes out from his blind to pick

up ducks, or catch cripples, or arrange decoys, he would better do so,

paying no attention whatever to the game that will immediately appear.

So now the whistle of wings merely caused me to work the faster. At

length I was able to wade ashore and sink into my blind.
[Pg 284]Immediately, as usual, the flights ceased for the time being. I had

nothing to do but sit tight and wait.
This was no unpleasant task. The mountains to the west had become

lucent, and glowed pink in the dawn; those to the east looked like

silhouettes of very thin slate-coloured cardboard stuck up on edge,

across which a pearl wash had been laid. The flatter world of the plains

all about me lay half revealed in an unearthly gray light. The wind

swooped and tore away at the brush, sending its fan-shaped cat's-paws

across the surface of the pond. My ducks, having finished their

ablutions, now gave a leisurely attention to smoothing out their plumes

ruffled by the night in the gunnysack. They ran each feather separately

through their bills, preening and smoothing. All the time they conversed

together in low tones of voice. Whenever one made a rather clever

remark, or smoothed to glossiness a particularly rumpled feather, he

wagged his short tail vigorously from side to side in satisfaction.
Suddenly the one farthest out in the pond stilled to attention and

craned forward his neck.
"Mark!" quoth he, loudly, and then again: "Mark!

quok—quok—quok!"
The other five looked in the same direction, and then they, too, lifted

up their voices. Cautiously I turned my head. Low against the growing

splendour of the sunrise, wings rigidly set, came a flock of mallards.

My ducks fairly stood up on their tails the better to hurl invitations

and inducements at their wild brethren. The chorus praising this

particular spot was vociferous and unanimous, I wonder what the mallards

thought of the other fifty or [Pg 285]sixty in my flock, the wooden ones, that

sat placidly aloof. Did they consider these remarkably exclusive; or did

they perhaps look upon the live ones as the "boosters" committee for

this particular piece of duck real estate? At any rate, they dropped in

without the slightest hesitation, which shows the value of live decoys.

The mallard is ordinarily a wily bird and circles your pond a number of

times before deciding to come in to wooden decoys. At the proper moment

I got to my feet, and, by good fortune, knocked down two fat

green-heads.
They fell with a splash right among my ducks. Did the latter exhibit

alarm over either the double concussion of the gun or this fall of

defunct game from above? Not at all! they were tickled to death. Each

swam vigorously around and around at the limit of his tether, ruffling

his plumage and waggling his tail with the utmost vigour.
"Well, I rather think we fooled that bunch!" said they, one to another.

"Did you ever see an easier lot? Came right down without a look! If the

Captain had been here he'd have killed a half dozen of the chumps before

they got out of range!" and so on. For your experienced decoy always

seems to enjoy the game hugely, and to enter into it with much

enthusiasm and intelligence. And all the while the flock of wooden

decoys headed unanimously up wind, and bobbed in the wavelets; and the

sun went on gilding the mountains to the west.
Next a flock of teal whirled down wind, stooped, and were gone like a

flash. I got in both barrels; and missed both. The dissatisfaction of

this was almost immediately mitigated by a fine smash at a flock of

sprig that went by [Pg 286]overhead at extreme long range, but from which I

managed to bring down a fine drake. When the shot hit him he faltered,

then, still flying, left the ranks at an acute angle, sloping ever the

quicker downward, until he fell on a long slant, his wings set, his neck

still outstretched. I marked the direction as well as I could, and

immediately went in search of him. Fortunately he lay in the open, quite

dead. Looking back, I could see another good flock fairly hovering over

the decoys.
The sun came up, and grew warm. The wind died. I took off my sweater.

Between flights I basked deliciously. The affair was outside of all

precedent and reason. A duck shooter ought to be out in a storm, a good

cold storm. He ought to break the scum ice when he puts out his decoys.

He ought to sit half frozen in a wintry blast, his fingers numb, his

nose blue, his body shivering. That sort of discomfort goes with duck

shooting. Yet here I was sitting out in a warm, summerlike day in my

shirt sleeves, waiting comfortably—and the ducks were coming in, too!
After a time I heard the mighty rattle of the Invigorator, and the

Captain's voice shouting. Reluctantly I disentangled myself from my

blind and went over to see what all the row was about.
"Had enough?" he demanded, cheerily.
I saw that I was supposed to say yes; so I said it. The ducks were still

coming in fast. You see, I was not yet free from the traditions to which

I had been brought up. Back in Michigan, when a man went for a day's

shoot, he stayed with it all day. It was serious business. I was not

[Pg 287]yet accustomed to being so close to the game that the casual expedition

was after all the most fun.
So I pulled up my rubber boots, and waded out, gathering in the game. To

my immense surprise I found that I had thirty-seven ducks down. It had

not occurred to me that I had shot half that number, which is perhaps

commentary on how fast ducks had been coming in. It was then only about

eight o'clock. After gathering them in, next we performed the slow and

very moist task of lifting the wooden decoys and winding their anchor

cords around their placid necks. Lastly we gathered in the live ducks.

They came, towed at the end of their tethers, with manifest reluctance;

hanging back at their strings, flapping their wings, and hissing at us

indignantly. I do not think they were frightened, for once we had our

hands on them, they resumed their dignified calm. Only they enjoyed the

fun outside; and they did not fancy the bags inside; a choice eminently

creditable to their sense.
So back we drove to the ranch. The Captain, too, had had good shooting.

Redmond appeared with an immense open hamper into which he dumped the

birds two by two, keeping tally in a loud voice. Redmond thoroughly

enjoyed all the small details.

[Pg 288]
CHAPTER IX
UNCLE JIM
Each morning, while we still sat at breakfast, Uncle Jim drove up from

the General's in his two-wheeled cart to see if there might be anything

doing. Uncle Jim was a solidly built elderly man, with the brown

complexion and the quizzical, good-humoured eye of the habitual

sportsman. He wore invariably an old shooting coat and a cap that had

seen younger, but perhaps not better, days. His vehicle was a battered

but serviceable two-wheeled cart drawn by a placid though adequate

horse. His weapon for all purposes was a rather ponderous twelve-gauge.
If we projected some sporting expedition Uncle Jim was our man; but if

there proved to be nothing in the wind, he disappeared promptly. He

conducted various trapping ventures for "varmints," at which he seemed

to have moderate success, for he often brought in a wildcat or coyote.

In fact, he maintained one of the former in a cage, to what end nobody

knew, for it was a harsh and unsociable character. Uncle Jim began to

show signs of life about July fifteenth when the dove season opened; he

came into his own from the middle of October until the first of

February, during which period one can shoot both ducks and quail; he

died down to the bare earth when the game season was over, and only sent

up a few green shoots of [Pg 289]interest in the matter of supplying his

wildcat with that innumerable agricultural pest, the blackbird.
Sometimes I accompanied Uncle Jim, occupying the other side of the

two-wheeled cart. We never had any definite object in view; we just went

forth for adventure. The old horse jogged along very steadily,

considering the fact that he was as likely to be put at cross country as

a road. We humped up side by side in sociable silence, spying keenly for

what we could see. A covey of quail disappearing in the brush caused us

to pull up. We hunted them leisurely for a half hour and gathered in a

dozen birds. Always we tried to sneak ducks, no matter how hopeless the

situation might seem. Once I went on one hand and my knees through three

inches of water for three hundred yards, stalking a flock of sprig

loafing in an irrigation puddle. There was absolutely no cover; I was in

plain sight; from a serious hunting standpoint the affair was quixotic,

not to say imbecile. If I had been out with the Captain we should

probably not have looked twice at those sprig. Nevertheless, as the

general atmosphere of Uncle Jim's expeditions was always one of

adventure and forlorn hopes and try-it-anyway, I tried it on. Uncle Jim

sat in the cart and chuckled. Every moment I expected the flock to take

wing, but they lingered. Finally, when still sixty yards distant, the

leaders rose. I cut loose with both barrels for general results. To my

vast surprise three came down, one dead, the other two wing-tipped. The

two latter led me a merry chase, wherein I managed to splatter the rest

of myself. Then I returned in triumph to the cart. The forlorn hope had

planted its banner on the walls of achieve[Pg 290]ment. Uncle Jim laughed at me

for my idiocy in crawling through water after such a fool chance. I

laughed at Uncle Jim because I had three ducks. We drove on, and the

warm sun dried me off.
In this manner we made some astonishing bags; astonishing not by their

size, but by the manner of their accomplishment.
We were entirely open minded. Anything that came along interested us. We

investigated all the holes in all the trees, in hopes of 'coons or honey

or something or other. We drove gloriously through every patch of brush.

Sometimes an unseen hummock would all but upset us; so we had to

scramble hastily to windward to restore our equilibrium.
The country was gridironed with irrigation ditches. They were eight to

ten feet deep, twenty or thirty feet wide, and with elevated,

precipitous banks. One could cross them almost anywhere—except when

they were brimful, of course. The banks were so steep that, once

started, the vehicle had to go, but so short that it must soon reach

bottom. On the other side the horse could attain the top by a rush;

after which, having gained at least a front footing over the bank, he

could draw the light vehicle by dead weight the rest of the distance.

Naturally, the driver had to take the course at exactly right angles, or

he capsized ingloriously.
One day Uncle Jim and I started to cross one of these ditches that had

long been permitted to remain dry. Its bottom was covered by weeds six

inches high, and looked to be about six feet down. We committed

ourselves to the slope. Then, when too late to reconsider, we discovered

[Pg 291]that the apparent six-inch growth of weeds was in reality one of four

or five feet. The horse discovered it at the same time. With true

presence of mind, he immediately determined that it was up to him to

leap that ditch. Only the fact that he was hitched to the cart prevented

him from doing so; but he made a praiseworthy effort.
The jerk threw me backward, and had I not grabbed Uncle Jim I would most

certainly have fallen out behind. As for Uncle Jim, he would most

certainly have fallen out behind, too, if he had not clung like grim

death to the reins. And as for the horse, alarmed by the check and

consequent scramble, he just plain bolted, fortunately straight ahead.

We hit the opposite bank with a crash, sailed over it, and headed across

country.
Consider us as we went. Feet in air, I was poised on the end of my

backbone in a state of exact equilibrium. A touch would tumble me out

behind; an extra ounce would tip me safely into the cart; my only

salvation was my hold on Uncle Jim. I could not apply that extra ounce

for the simple reason that Uncle Jim also, feet in air, was poised

exactly on the end of his backbone. If the reins slackened an inch, over

he went; if he could manage to pull up the least bit in the world, in he

came! So we tore across country for several hundred yards, unable to

recover and most decidedly unwilling to fall off on the back of our

heads. It must have been a grand sight; and it seemed to endure an hour.

Finally, imperceptibly we overcame the opposing forces. We were saved!
Uncle Jim cursed out "Henry" with great vigour. Henry was the mare we

drove. Uncle Jim, in his naming of [Pg 292]animals, always showed a stern

disregard for the female sex. Then, as usual, we looked about to see

what we could see.
Over to the left grew a small white oak. About ten or twelve feet from

the ground was a hole. That was enough; we drove over to investigate

that hole. It was not an easy matter, for we were too lazy to climb the

tree unless we had to. Finally we drove close enough so that, by

standing on extreme tip-toe atop the seat of the cart, I could get a

sort of sidewise, one-eyed squint at that hole.
"If," I warned Uncle Jim, "Henry leaves me suspended in mid-air I'll

bash her fool head in!"
"No, you won't," chuckled Uncle Jim, "it's too far home."
It was a very dark hole, and for a moment I could see nothing. Then, all

at once, I made out two dull balls of fire glowing steadily out of the

blackness. That was as long as I could stand stretching out my entire

anatomy to look down any hole.
On hearing my report, Uncle Jim phlegmatically thrust the flexible whip

down the hole.
"'Coon," he pronounced, after listening to the resultant remarks from

within.
And then the same bright idea struck us both.
"Mrs. Kitty here makes good with those angleworms," Uncle Jim voiced the

inspiration.
We blocked up the hole securely; and made rapid time back to the ranch.

[Pg 293]
CHAPTER X
THE MEDIUM-SIZE GAME
Against many attacks and accusations of uselessness cast at her

dachshunds, Mrs. Kitty had always stoutly opposed the legend of

"medium-size game." The dachshunds may look like bologna sausages on

legs, ran the gist of her argument; and they may progress like rather

lively measuring worms; and the usefulness of their structure may seem

to limit itself to a facility for getting under furniture without

stooping, but—Mrs. Kitty's eloquence always ended by convincing

herself, and she became very serious—but that is not the dogs' fault.

Rather it is the fault of their environment to which they have been

transplanted. Back in their own native vaterland they were always used

for medium-sized game. And what is more they are good at it! Come

here, Pete, they shan't abuse you!
Coyotes and bobcats are medium-size game, someone ventured to point out.
Not at all, medium-size game should live in holes, like badgers.

Dachshunds are evidently built for holes. They are long and low, and

they have spatulate feet for digging, and their bandy legs enable them

to throw the dirt out behind them. Their long, sharp noses are like

tweezers to seize upon the medium-size game. In short, by much

repetition, a legend had grown up around the [Pg 294]dachshunds, a legend of

fierceness inhibited only by circumstances, of pathetic deprivation of

the sports of their native land. If only we could have a badger, we

could almost hear them say to each other in dog language, a strong,

morose, savage badger! Alas! we are wasting our days in idleness, our

talents rust from disuse! Finally, Uncle Jim remained the only frankly

skeptical member.
At this time there visited the ranch two keen sportsmen whom we shall

call Charley and Tommy; as also several girls. We burst on the assembled

multitude with our news. Immediately a council of war was called. After

the praetors and tribunes of the people had uttered their opinions,

Uncle Jim arose and spoke as follows:
"Here is your chance to make good," said he, addressing Mrs. Kitty.

"Those badger hounds of yours, according to you, have just been fretting

for medium-size game. Well, here's some. Bring out the whole flock, and

let's see them get busy."
The proposition was received with a shout of rapture Uncle Jim smiled

grimly.
"Well, they'll do it!" cried Mrs. Kitty, with spirit.
Preparations were immediately under way. In half an hour the army

debouched from the ranch and strung out single file across the plain.
First came Uncle Jim and myself in the two-wheeled cart as scouts and

guides.
Followed the General in his surrey. The surrey had originally been

intended for idle dalliance along country lanes. In the days of its

glory it had been upholstered right merrily, and around its flat top had

dangled a blithe[Pg 295]some fringe. Both the upholstery and fringe were still

somewhat there. Of the glory that was past no other reminder had

persisted. The General sat squarely in the middle of the front seat,

very large, erect, and imposing, driving with a fine military disregard

of hummocks or the laws of equilibrium. In or near the back seat hovered

a tiny Japanese boy to whom the General occasionally issued short,

sharp, military comments or commands.
Then came Mrs. Kitty and the ponies with Carrie beside her. Immediately

astern of the pony cart followed a three-seated carry-all with assorted

guests. This was flanked by the Captain and Charley as outriders. The

rear was closed by the Invigorator rilled with dachshunds. Their pointed

noses poked busily through the slats of the cage, and sniffed up over

the edge of the wagon box.
The rear, did I say? I had forgotten Mithradates Antikamia Briggs. The

latter polysyllabic person was a despised, apologetic, rangy,

black-and-white mongrel hound said to have belonged somewhere to a man

named Briggs. I think the rest of his name was intended as an insult.

Ordinarily Mithradates hung around the men's quarters where he was

liked. Never had he dared seek either solace or sympathy at the doors of

the great house; and never, never had he remotely dreamed of following

any of the numerous hunting expeditions. That would have been

lese-majesty, high treason, sublime impudence, and intolerable nuisance

to be punished by banishment or death. Mithradates realized this

perfectly; and never did he presume to raise his eyes to such high and

shining affairs.
But to-day he followed. Nobody was subsequently [Pg 296]able to explain why

Mithradates Antikamia should on this one occasion so have plucked up

heart. My private opinion is that he saw the dachshunds being taken,

and, in his uncultivated manner, communed with himself as follows:
"Well, will you gaze on that! I don't pretend to be in the same class

with Old Ben or Young Ben, or even of the fox terriers; but if I'm not

more of a dog than that lot of splay-footed freaks, I'll go bite myself!

If they're that hard up for dogs, I'll be cornswizzled if I don't go

myself!"
Which he did. We did not want him; this was distinctly the dachshunds'

party, and we did not care to have any one messing in. The Captain tried

to drive him back. Mithradates Antikamia would not go. The Captain

dismounted and tried force. Mithradates shut both eyes, crouched to the

ground, and immediately weighed a half ton. When punished he rolled over

and held all four paws in the air. The minute the Captain turned his

back, after stern admonitions to "go home!" and "down, charge!" and the

like, Mithradates crawled slowly forward to the waiting line, ducking

his head, wrinkling his upper lips ingratiatingly, and sneezing in the

most apologetic tones. Finally we gave it up.
"But," we "saved our face," "you'll have to behave when we get there!"
So, as has been said, Mithradates Antikamia Briggs brought up the rear.
Arrived at the tree the whole procession drew into a half circle. We

unblocked the opening, and the Invigorator was driven to a spot beneath

it so each person [Pg 297]could take his turn at standing on the seat and

peering down the hole. The eyes still glowed like balls of fire.
Next the dachshunds were lifted up one by one and given a chance to

smell at the game. This was to make them keen. Held up by means of a

hand held either side their chests, they curled up their hind legs and

tails and seemed to endure. Mrs. Kitty explained that they had never

been so far off the ground in their lives, and so were naturally

preoccupied by the new sensation. This sounded reasonable, so we placed

them on the ground. There they sat in a circle looking up at our

performances, a solemn and mild interest expressing itself in their

lugubrious countenances. A dachshund has absolutely no sense of humour

or lightness of spirits. He never cavorts.
By sounding carefully with a carriage whip we determined the depth of

the hole, and proceeded to cut through to the bottom. This was quite a

job, for the oak was tough, and the position difficult. Tommy had

ascended the tree, and proclaimed loudly the first signs of daylight as

the axe bit through. Mine happened to be the axe work; so when I had

finished a neat little orifice, I swung up beside Tommy, and the

Invigorator drove out of the way.
My elevated position was a good one; and as Tommy was peering eagerly

down the hole, I had nothing to do but survey the scene.
The rigs were drawn up in a semi-circle twenty yards away. Next the

horses' heads stood the drivers of the various vehicles, anxious to miss

none of the fun. The dachshunds sat on their haunches, looking up, and

probably [Pg 298]wondering why their friend, Tommy, insisted on roosting up a

tree. The Captain and Charley were immediately below, engaged in an

earnest effort to poke the 'coon into ascending the hole. Tommy was

reporting the result of these efforts from above. The General, his feet

firmly planted, had unlimbered a huge ten-bore shotgun, so as to be

ready for anything. Uncle Jim stood by, smoking his pipe. Mithradates

Antikamia Briggs sat sadly apart.
The poking efforts accomplished little. Occasionally the 'coon made a

little dash or scramble, but never went far. There was a great deal of

talking, shouting, and advice.
At last Uncle Jim, knocking the ashes from his pipe, moved into action.

He plucked a double handful of the tall, dry grass, touched a match to

it, and thrust it in the nick.
Without the slightest hesitation the 'coon shot out at the top!
Now just at that moment Tommy happened to be leaning over for a right

good look down the hole. He received thirty pounds or so of agitated

'coon square in the chest. Thereupon he fell out of the tree

incontinently, with the 'coon on top of him.
We caught our breath in horror. Although we could plainly see that Tommy

was in no degree injured by his short fall, yet we all realized that it

was going to be serious to be mixed up with a raging, snarling beast

fight of twenty-two members. When the dachshunds should pounce on their

natural prey, the medium-size game, poor Tommy would be at the bottom of

the heap. Several even started forward to restrain the dogs, but stopped

as they realized the impossibilities.
[Pg 299]Tommy and the 'coon hit with a thump. The dachshunds took one horrified

look; then with the precision of a drilled manœuvre they unanimously

turned tail and plunged into the tall grass. From my elevated perch I

could see it waving agitatedly as they made their way through it in the

direction of the distant ranch.
For a moment there was astounded silence. Then there arose a shriek of

delight. The Captain rolled over and over and clutched handfuls of turf

in his joy. The General roared great salvos of laughter. Tommy, still

seated where he had fallen, leaned weakly against the tree, the tears

coursing down his cheeks. The rest of the populace lifted up their

voices and howled. Even Uncle Jim, who rarely laughed aloud, although

his eyes always smiled, emitted great Ho! ho!'s. Only Mrs. Kitty, dumb

with indignation, stared speechless after that wriggling mess of

fugitives.
The occasion was too marvellous. We enjoyed it to the full. Whenever the

rapture sank somewhat, someone would gasp out a half-remembered bit of

Mrs. Kitty's former defences.
"Their long, sharp noses are like tweezers to seize the game!" declaimed

Charley, weakly. [Spasm by the audience.]
"Their spatulate feet are meant for digging," the Captain took up the

tale. [Another spasm.]
"Their bandy legs enabled them to throw the dirt out behind them—as

they ran," suggested Tommy.
"If only they could have had a badger they'd have beaten all records!"

we chorused.
And then finally we wiped our eyes and remembered that [Pg 300]there used to be

a 'coon. At the same time we became conscious of a most unholy row in

the offing: the voice of Mithradates Antikamia.
"If you people want your 'coon," he was remarking in a staccato and

exasperated voice, "you'd better come and lend a hand. I can't manage

him alone! The blame thing has bitten me in three places already. Of

course, I like to see people have a good time, and I hope you won't

curtail your enjoyment on my account; but if you've had quite enough

of those made-in-Germany imitations, perhaps you'll just stroll over and

see what one good American-built DOG can do!"

[Pg 301]
CHAPTER XI
IN SEARCH OF ADVENTURE
Uncle Jim had friends everywhere. Continually we were pulling up by one

of the tiny two-roomed shacks wherein dwelt the small settlers. The

houses were always of new boards, unpainted, perched on four-by-fours,

in the middle of bare ground, perhaps surrounded by young poplars or

cottonwoods, but more likely fully exposed to the sun. A trifling open

shed protected a battered buggy on the thills and wheels of which

perched numerous chickens. A rough corral and windmill completed the

arrangements. Near the house was usually a small patch of alfalfa.

Farther out the owner was engaged in the strenuous occupation of

brushing and breaking a virgin country.
To greet us rushed forth a half-dozen mongrel dogs, and appeared a swarm

of children, followed by the woman of the place. Uncle Jim knew them all

by name, including even the dogs. He carefully wound the reins around

the whip, leaned forward comfortably, and talked. Henry dozed; and I

listened with interest. Uncle Jim had the natural gift of popularity. By

either instinct or a wide experience he knew just what problems and

triumphs, disappointments and perplexities these people were

encountering; and he plunged promptly into the discussion of them. Also,

I was never able to make out whether Uncle Jim was a con[Pg 302]scious or

unconscious diplomat; but certainly he knew how judiciously to make use

of the subtle principle, so well illustrated by Molière, that it pleases

people to confer small favours. Thus occasionally he gravely "borrowed"

a trifle of axle grease, which we immediately applied, or a cup of milk,

or a piece of string to mend something. When finally our leisurely

roadside call was at an end, we rolled away from unanimously hearty

signals of farewell.
In accordance with our settled feeling of taking things as they came,

and trying for everything, we blundered into varied experiences, none of

which arrange themselves in recollection with any pretence of logical

order. Perhaps it might not be a bad idea to copy our method, to set

forth and see where we land.
One of the most amusing happened when we were out with my younger, but

not smaller, brother. This youth was at that time about eighteen years

old, and six feet two in height. His age plus his stature equalled a

certain lankiness. As we drove peacefully along the highway we observed

in the adjacent field a coyote. The animal was some three or four

hundred yards away, lying down, his head between his paws, for all the

world like a collie dog. Immediately the lad was all excitement. We

pointed out the well-known facts that the coyote is no fool and is

difficult to stalk at best; that while he is apparently tame as long as

the wagon keeps moving, he decamps when convinced that his existence is

receiving undue attention; that in the present instance the short grass

would not conceal a snake; and that, finally, a 16-gauge gun loaded with

number-six shot was not an encouraging coyote [Pg 303]weapon. He brushed them

aside as mere details. So we let him out.
He dropped into the grass and commenced his stalk. This he accomplished

on his elbows and knees. A short review of the possibilities will

convince you that the sight was unique. Although the boy's head and

shoulders were thus admirably close to the ground, there followed an

extremely abrupt apex. Add the fact that the canvas shooting coat soon

fell forward over his shoulders.
The coyote at first paid no attention. As this strange object worked

nearer, he raised his head to take a look. Then he sat up on his

haunches to take a better look. At this point we expected him to lope

away instead of which he trotted forward a few feet and stopped, his

ears pricked forward. There he sat, his shrewd brain alive with

conjecture until, at thirty-five yards, the kid emptied both barrels.

Thereupon he died, his curiosity as to what a movable brown pyramid

might be still unsatisfied.
Uncle Jim, the kid, and I had great fun cruising for jackrabbits. Uncle

Jim sat in the middle and drove while the kid and I hung our feet over

the sides and constituted ourselves the port and starboard batteries.

Bumping and banging along at full speed over the uneven country, we

jumped the rabbits, and opened fire as they made off. Each had to stick

to his own side of the ship, of course. Uncle Jim's bird dog, his head

between our feet, his body under the seat, watched the proceedings,

whining. It looked like good fun to him, but it was forbidden. A

jackrabbit arrested in full flight by a charge of shot turns a very

spectacular somersault. The dog would stand [Pg 304]about five rabbits. As the

sixth turned over, he executed a mad struggle, accomplished a flying

leap over the front wheel, was rolled over and over by the forward

momentum of the moving vehicle, scrambled to his feet, pounced on that

rabbit, and most everlastingly and savagely shook it up! Then Uncle Jim

descended and methodically and dispassionately licked the dog.
Jackrabbits were good small-rifle game. They started away on a slow

lope, but generally stopped and sat up if not too seriously alarmed. A

whistle sometimes helped bring them to a stand. After a moment's

inspection they went away, rapidly. With a .22 automatic one could turn

loose at all sorts of ranges at all speeds. It was a good deal of fun,

too, sneaking about afoot through the low brush, making believe that the

sage was a jungle, the tiny pellets express bullets, the rabbits

magnified—I am sorry for the fellow who cannot have fun sometimes

"pretending!" In the brush, too, dwelt little cottontails, very good to

eat. The jackrabbit was a pest, but the cottontail was worth getting. We

caught sight of him first in the bare open spaces between the bushes,

whereupon he proceeded rapidly to cover. It was necessary to shoot

rather quickly. The inexperienced would be apt to run forward eagerly,

hoping to catch a glimpse of the cottontail on the other side; but

always it would be in vain. That would be owing to the fact that the

little rabbit has a trick of apparently running through a brush at full

speed, but in reality of stopping abruptly and squatting at the roots.

Often it is possible to get a shot by scrutinizing carefully the last

place he was seen. He can stop as suddenly as a cow pony.
[Pg 305]Often and often, like good strategic generals, we were induced by

circumstances to change our plans or our method of attack at the last

moment. On several occasions, while shooting in the fields of Egyptian

corn, I have killed a quail with my right barrel and a duck with my

left! Continually one was crouching in hopes, when some unexpected flock

stooped toward him as he walked across country. These hasty concealments

were in general quite futile, for it is a fairly accurate generalization

that, in the open, game will see you before you see it. This is not

always true. I have on several occasions stood stock still in the open

plain until a low-flying mallard came within easy range. Invariably the

bird was flying toward the setting sun, so I do not doubt his vision was

more or less blinded.
The most ridiculous effort of this sort was put into execution by the

Captain and myself.
Be it premised that while, in the season, the wildfowl myriads were

always present, it by no means followed that the sportsman was always

sure of a bag. The ducks followed the irrigation water. One week they

might be here in countless hordes; the next week might see only a few

coots and hell divers left, while the game was reported twenty miles

away. Furthermore, although fair shooting—of the pleasantest sort, in

my opinion—was always to be had by jumping small bands and singles from

the "holes" and ditches, the big flocks were quite apt to feed and loaf

in the wide spaces discouragingly free of cover. Irrigation was done on

a large scale. A section of land might be submerged from three inches to

a foot in depth. In the middle of this temporary pond and a half dozen

others like it fed [Pg 306]the huge bands of ducks. What could you do? There

was no cover by which to sneak them. You might build a blind, but before

the ducks could get used to its strange presence in a flat and

featureless landscape the water would be withdrawn from that piece of

land. Only occasionally, when a high wind drove them from the open, or

when the irrigation water happened to be turned in to a brushy country,

did the sportsman get a chance at the great swarms. Since a man could

get all the ducks he could reasonably require, there was no real reason

why he should look with longing on these inaccessible packs, but we all

did. It was not that we wanted more ducks; for we held strictly within

limits, but we wanted to get in the thick of it.
On the occasion of which I started to tell, the Captain and I were

returning from somewhere. Near the Lakeside ranch we came across a big

tract of land overflowed by not deeper than two or three inches of

water. The ducks were everywhere on it. They sat around fat and solemn

in flocks; they swirled and stooped and lit and rose again; they fed

busily; they streamed in from all points of the compass, cleaving the

air with a whistling of wings.
Cover there was none. It was exactly like a big, flat cow pasture

without any fences. We pulled up the Invigorator and eyed the scene with

speculative eyes. Finally, we did as follows:
Into the middle of that field waded we. The ducks, of course, arose with

a roar, circled once out of range, and departed. We knew that in less

than a minute the boldest would return to see if, perchance, we might

have been mere passers-by. Finding us still there, they would, in the

[Pg 307]natural course of events, circle once or twice and then depart for

good.
Now we had noticed this: ducks will approach to within two or three

hundred yards of a man standing upright, but they will come within one

hundred—or almost in range—if he squats and holds quite still. This,

we figured, is because he is that much more difficult to recognize as a

man, even though he is in plain sight. We had to remain in plain sight;

but could we not make ourselves more difficult to recognize?
After pulling up our rubber boots carefully, we knelt in the two inches

of water, placed our chests across two wooden shell boxes we had brought

for the purpose, ducked our heads, and waited. After a few moments

overhead came the peculiar swift whistle of wings. We waited, rigid.

When that whistle sounded very loud indeed, we jerked ourselves upright

and looked up. Immediately above us, already towering frantically, was a

flock of sprig. They were out of range, but we were convinced that this

was only because we had mistakenly looked up too soon.
It was fascinating work, for we had to depend entirely on the sense of

hearing. The moment we stirred in the slightest degree away went the

ducks. As it took an appreciable time to rise to our feet, locate the

flock, and get into action, we had to guess very accurately. We fired a

great many times, and killed a very few; but each duck was an

achievement.
Though the bag could not be guaranteed, the sight of ducks could. When

my brother went with me to the ranch, the duck shooting was very poor.

This was owing [Pg 308]to the fact that sudden melting of the snows in the

Sierras had overflowed an immense tract of country to form a lake eight

or nine miles across. On this lake the ducks were safe, and thither they

resorted in vast numbers. As a consequence, the customary resorts were

deserted. We could see the ducks, and that was about all. Realizing the

hopelessness of the situation we had been confining ourselves so

strictly to quail that my brother had begun to be a little sceptical of

our wildfowl tales. Therefore, one day, I took him out and showed him

ducks.
They were loafing in an angle of the lake formed by the banks of two

submerged irrigating ditches, so we were enabled to measure them

accurately. After they had flown we paced off their bulk. They had

occupied a space on the bank and in the water three hundred yards long

by fifty yards wide; and they were packed in there just about as thick

as ducks could crowd together. An able statistician might figure out how

many there were. At any rate, my brother agreed that he had seen some

ducks.
There was one thing about Uncle Jim's expeditions: they were cast in no

rigid lines. Their direction, scope, or purpose could be changed at the

last moment should circumstances warrant.
One day Uncle Jim came after me afoot, with the quiet assurance that he

knew where there were "some ducks."
"Tommy is down there now," said he, "in a blind. We'll make a couple

more blinds across the pond, and in that way one or the other of us is

sure to get a shot at everything that comes in. And the way they're

coming in is scand'lous!"
[Pg 309]Therefore I filled my pockets with duck shells, seized my close-choked

12-bore, and followed Uncle Jim. We walked across three fields.
"Those ducks are acting mighty queer," proffered Uncle Jim in puzzled

tones.
We stopped a moment to watch. Flock after flock stooped toward the

little pond, setting their wings and dropping with the extraordinary

confidence wildfowl sometimes exhibit. At a certain point, however, and

while still at a good elevation, they towered swiftly and excitedly.
"Doesn't seem like they'd act so scared even if Tommy wasn't well hid,"

puzzled Uncle Jim.
We proceeded cautiously, keeping out of sight behind some greasewood,

until we could see the surface of the pond. There were Tommy's decoys,

and there was Tommy's blind. We could not see but that it was a

well-made blind. Even as we looked another flock of sprig sailed down

wind, stopped short at a good two hundred yards, towered with every

appearance of lively dismay, and departed. Tommy's head came above the

blind, gazing after them.
"They couldn't act worse if Tommy was out waving his hat at 'em," said

Uncle Jim.
We climbed a fence. This brought us to a slight elevation, but

sufficient to enable us to see abroad over the flat landscape.
Immediately beyond Tommy was a long, low irrigation check grown with

soft green sod. On the farther slope thereof were the girls. They had

brought magazines and fancy work, and evidently intended to spend the

afternoon in the open, enjoying the fresh air and the glad sunshine [Pg 310]and

the cheerful voices of God's creatures. They were, of course, quite

unconscious of Tommy's sporting venture not a hundred feet away. Their

parasols were green, red, blue, and other explosive tints.
Uncle Jim and I sat for a few moments on the top of that fence enjoying

the view. Then we climbed softly down and went away. We decided tacitly

not to shoot ducks. The nature of the expedition immediately changed. We

spent the rest of the afternoon on quail. To be sure number-five shot in

a close-choked twelve is not an ideal load for the purpose; but by care

in letting our birds get far enough away we managed to have a very good

afternoon's sport. And whenever we would make a bad miss we had ready

consolation: the thought of Tommy waiting and wondering and puzzling in

his blind.

[Pg 311]
CHAPTER XII
THE GRAND TOUR
Almost always our sporting expeditions were of this casual character,

sandwiched in among other occupations. Guns were handy, as was the game.

To seize the one and pursue the other on the whim of the moment was the

normal and usual thing. Thus one day Mrs. Kitty drove me over to look at

a horse I was thinking of buying. On the way home, in a corner of brush,

I hopped out and bagged twelve quail; and a little farther on, by a

lucky sneak, I managed to gather in five ducks from an irrigation pond.

On another occasion, having a spare hour before lunch, I started out

afoot from the ranch house at five minutes past eleven, found my quail

within a quarter mile, had luck in scattering them, secured my limit of

twenty-five, and was back at the house at twelve twenty-five! Before

this I had been to drive with Mrs. Kitty; and after lunch we drove

twelve miles to call on a neighbour. Although I had enjoyed a full day's

quail shoot, it had been, as it were, merely an interpolation.
Occasionally, however, it was elected to make a grand and formal raid on

the game. This could be either a get-up-early-in-the-morning session in

the blinds, a formal quail hunt, or the Grand Tour.
To take the Grand Tour we got out the Liver Invigorator [Pg 312]and as many

saddle horses as might be needed to accommodate the shooters. On

reaching the hog field it was proper to disembark, and to line up for an

advance on the corner of the irrigation ditch where I had so

unexpectedly jumped the ducks my first morning on the ranch. In extended

order we approached. If ducks were there, they got a great hammering.

Everybody shot joyously—whether in sure range or not, it must be

confessed. The birds went into a common bag, for it would be impossible

to say who had killed what. After congratulations and reproaches, both

of which might be looked upon as sacrifices to the great god Josh, we

swung to the left and tramped a half mile to the artesian well. The

Invigorator and saddle horses followed at a respectful distance. When we

had investigated the chances at the well, we climbed aboard again and

rattlety-banged across country to the Slough.
The Slough comprised a wide and varied country. In proper application it

was a little winding ravine sunk eight or ten feet below the flat plain,

and filled with water. This water had been grown thick with trees, but

occasionally, for some reason to me unknown, the growth gave space for

tiny open ponds or channels. These were further screened by occasional

willows or greasewood growing on the banks. They were famous loafing

places for mallards.
It was great fun to slip from bend to bend of the Slough, peering

keenly, moving softly, trying to spy through the thick growth to a

glimpse of the clear water. The ducks were very wary. It was necessary

to know the exact location of each piece of open water, its

surroundings, and how best it was to be approached. Only too often, peer

as [Pg 313]cautiously as we might, the wily old mallards would catch a glimpse

of some slight motion. At once they would begin to swim back and forth

uneasily. Always then we would withdraw cautiously, hoping against hope

that suspicion would die. It never did. Our stalk would disclose to us

only a troubled surface of water on which floated lightly a half dozen

feathers.
But when things went right we had a beautiful shot. The ducks towered

straight up, trying to get above the level of the brush, affording a

shot at twenty-five or thirty yards' range. We always tried to avoid

shooting at the same bird, but did not always succeed. Old Ben delighted

in this work, for now he had a chance to plunge in after the fallen. As

a matter of fact, it would have been quite useless to shoot ducks in

these circumstances had we not possessed a good retriever like Old Ben.
The Slough proper was about two miles long, and had probably eight or

ten "holes" in which ducks might be expected. The region of the Slough

was, however, a different matter.
It was a fascinating stretch of country, partly marshy, partly dry, but

all of it overgrown with tall and rustling tules. These reeds were

sometimes so dense that one could not force his way through them; at

others so low and thin that they barely made good quail cover. Almost

everywhere a team could be driven; and yet there were soft places and

water channels and pond holes in which a horse would bog down

hopelessly. From a point on the main north-and-south ditch a man afoot

left the bank to plunge directly into a jungle of reeds ten feet tall.

Through them narrow [Pg 314]passages led him winding and twisting and doubting

in a labyrinth. He waded in knee-deep water, but confidently, for he

knew the bottom to be solid beneath his feet. On either side, fairly

touching his elbows, the reeds stood tall and dense, so that it seemed

to him that he walked down a narrow and winding hallway. And every once

in a while the hallway debouched into a secret shallow pond lying in the

middle of the tule jungle in which might or might not be ducks. If there

were ducks, it behooved him to shoot very, very quickly, for those that

fell in the tules were probably not to be recovered. Then more narrow

passages led to other ponds.
Always the footing was good, so that a man could strike forward

confidently. But again there are other places in the Slough region where

one has to walk for half a mile to pass a miserable little trickle only

just too wide to step across. The watercress grows thick against either

oozy bank, leaving a clear of only a foot. Yet it is bottomless.
The Captain knew this region thoroughly, and drove in it by landmarks of

his own. After many visits I myself got to know the leading "points of

interest" and how to get to them by a set route; but their relations one

to another have always remained a little vague.
For instance, there was an earthen reservoir comprising two circular

connecting ponds, elevated slightly above the surrounding flats, so that

a man ascended an incline to stand on its banks. One half of this

reservoir is bordered thickly by tules; but the other half is without

growth. We left the Invigorator at some hundreds of yards distance; and,

single file, followed the Captain. We stopped when he did, [Pg 315]crawled when

he did, watched to see what dry and rustling footing he avoided, every

sense alert to play accurately this unique game of "follow my leader."

He alone kept watch of the cover, the game, and the plan of attack. We

were like the tail of a snake, merely following where the head directed.

This was not because the Captain was so much more expert than ourselves,

but so as to concentrate the chances of remaining undiscovered. If each

of us had worked out his own stalk we should have multiplied the chances

of alarming the game; we should have created the necessity for signals;

and we should have had the greatest difficulty in synchronizing our

arrival at the shooting point. We moved a step at a time, feeling

circumspectly before resting our weight. At the last moment the Captain

motioned with his hand. Wriggling forward, we came into line. Then, very

cautiously, we crawled up the bank of the reservoir and peered over!

That was the supreme moment! The wildfowl might arise in countless

numbers; in which case we shot as carefully and as quickly as possible,

reloading and squatting motionless in the almost certain hope of a

long-range shot or so at a straggler as the main body swung back over

us. Or, again, our eager eyes were quite likely to rest upon nothing but

a family party of mud-hens gossiping sociably.
Just beyond the reservoir on the other side was an overflowed small

flat. It was simply hummocky solid ground with a little green grass and

some water. Behind the hummocks, even after a cannonade at the

reservoir, we were almost certain to jump two or three single spoonbills

or teal. Why they stayed there, I could not tell you; but stay they

[Pg 316]did. We walked them up one at a time, as we would quail. The range was

long. Sometimes we got them; and sometimes we did not.
From the reservoir we drove out into the illimitable tules. The horses

went forward steadily, breasting the rustling growth. Behind them the

Invigorator rocked and swayed like a small boat in a tide rip. We stayed

in as best we could, our guns bristling up in all directions. The

Captain drove from a knowledge of his own. After some time, across the

yellow, waving expanse of the rushes, we made out a small dead willow

stub slanted rakishly. At sight of this we came to a halt. Just beyond

that stub lay a denser thicket of tules, and in the middle of them was

known to be a patch of open water about twenty feet across. There was

not much to it; but invariably a small bunch of fat old greenheads were

loafing in the sun.
It now became, not a question of game, for it was always there, but a

question of getting near enough to shoot. To be sure, the tiny pond was

so well covered that a stranger to the country would actually be unaware

of its existence until he broke through the last barrier of tules; but,

by the same token, that cover was the noisiest cover invented for the

protection of ducks. Often and often, when still sixty or seventy yards

distant, we heard the derisive quack, quack, quack, with which a

mallard always takes wing, and, a moment later, would see those wily

birds rising above the horizon. A false step meant a crackle; a stumble

meant a crash. We fairly wormed our way in by inches. Each yard gained

was a triumph. When, finally, after a half hour of Indian work, we had

managed to line up ready for the [Pg 317]shot, we felt that we had really a few

congratulations coming. We knew that within fifteen or twenty feet

floated the wariest of feathered game; and absolutely unconscious of

our presence.
"Now!" the Captain remarked, aloud, in conversational tones.
We stood up, guns at present. The Captain's command was answered by the

instant beat of wings and the confused quicker calling of alarm. In the

briefest fraction of a second the ducks appeared above the tules. They

had to tower straight up, for the pond was too small and the reeds too

high to permit of any sneaking away. So close were they that we could

see the markings of every feather—the iridescence of the heads, the

delicate, wave-marked cinnamons and grays and browns, even the absurd

little curled plumes over the tails. The guns cracked merrily, the

shooters aiming at the up-stretched necks. Down came the quarry with

mighty splashes that threw the water high. The remnant of the flock

swung away. We stood upright and laughed and joked and exulted after the

long strain of our stalk. Ben plunged in again and again, bringing out

the game.
Of these tule holes there were three. When we had visited them each in

turn we swung back toward the west. There, after much driving, we came

to the land of irrigation ditches again. At each new angle one of us

would descend, sneak cautiously to the bank and, bending low, peer down

the length of the ditch. If ducks were in sight, he located them

carefully and then we made our sneak. If not, we drove on to the next

bend. Once we all lay behind an [Pg 318]embankment like a lot of soldiers

behind a breastwork while one of us made a long détour around a big

flock resting in an overflow across the ditch. The ruse was successful.

The ducks, rising at sight of the scout, flew high directly over the

ambuscade. A battery of six or eight guns thereupon opened up. I believe

we killed three or four ducks among us; but if we had not brought down a

feather we should have been satisfied with the fact that our stratagem

succeeded.
So at the last, just as the sun was setting, we completed the circle and

landed at the ranch. We had been out all day in the warm California sun

and the breezes that blow from the great mountains across the plains; we

had worked hard enough to deserve an appetite; we had in a dozen

instances exercised our wit or our skill against the keen senses of wild

game; we had used our ingenuity in meeting unexpected conditions; we had

had a heap of companionship and good-natured fun one with another; we

had seen a lot of country. This was much better than sitting solitary

anchored in a blind. To be sure a man could kill more ducks from a

blind; but what of that?

[Pg 319]
CHAPTER XIII
RANCH ACTIVITIES
Big as it was, the ranch was only a feeder for the open range. Way down

in southeastern Arizona its cattle had their birth and grew to their

half-wild maturity. They won their living where they could, fiercely

from the fierce desert. On the broad plains they grazed during the fat

season; and as the feed shortened and withered, they retired slowly to

the barren mountains. In long lines they plodded to the watering places;

and in long, patient lines they plodded their way back again, until deep

and indelible troughs had been worn in the face of the earth. Other

living creatures they saw few, save the coyotes that hung on their

flanks, the jackrabbits, the prairie dogs, the birds strangely cheerful

in the face of the mysterious and solemn desert. Once in a while a pair

of mounted men jog-trotted slowly here and there among them. They gave

way to right and left, swinging in the free trot of untamed creatures,

their heads high, their eyes wild. Probably they remembered the terror

and ignominy and temporary pain of the branding. The men examined them

with critical eye, and commented technically and passed on.
This was when the animals were alive with the fat grasses. But as the

drought lengthened, they pushed farther into the hills until the boldest

or hardiest of them [Pg 320]stood on the summits, and the weakest merely stared

dully as the mounted men jingled by. The desert, kind in her bounty, was

terrible in her wrath. She took her toll freely and the dried bones of

her victims rattled in the wind. The fittest survived. Durham died,

Hereford lived through, and turned up after the first rains wiry, lean,

and active.
Then came the round-up. From the hidden defiles, the buttes and ranges,

the hills and plains, the cowboys drew their net to the centre. Each

"drive" brought together on some alkali flat thousands of the restless,

milling, bawling cattle. The white dust rose in a cloud against the very

blue sky. Then, while some of the cowboys sat their horses as sentinels,

turning the herd back on itself, others threaded a way through the

multitude, edging always toward the border of the herd some animal

uneasy in the consciousness that it was being followed. Surrounding the

main herd, and at some distance from it, other smaller herds rapidly

formed from the "cut." Thus there was one composed entirely of cows and

unbranded calves; another of strays from neighbouring ranges; and a

third of the steers considered worthy of being made into beef cattle.
In due time the main herd was turned back on the range; the strays had

been cut out and driven home by the cowboys of their several owners; the

calves had been duly branded and sent out on the desert to grow up. But

there remained still compact the beef herd. When all the excitement of

the round-up had died, it showed as the tangible profit of the year.
Its troubles began. Driven to the railroad and into the corrals, it next

had to be urged to its first experience of side[Pg 321]door Pullmans. There the

powerful beasts went frantic. Pike poles urged them up the chute into

the cars. They rushed, and hesitated, and stopped and turned back in a

panic. At times it seemed impossible to get them started into the narrow

chute. On the occasion of one after-dark loading old J.B., the foreman,

discovered that the excited steers would charge a lantern light.

Therefore he posted himself, with a lantern, in the middle of the chute.

Promply the maddened animals rushed at him. He skipped nimbly one side,

scaled the fence of the chute. "Now keep 'em coming, boys!" he urged.
The boys did their best, and half filled the car. Then some other

impulse seized the bewildered rudimentary brains; the cattle balked.

J.B. did it again, and yet again, until the cars were filled.
You have seen the cattle trains, rumbling slowly along, the crowded

animals staring stupidly through the bars. They are not having a

particularly hard time, considering the fact that they are undergoing

their first experience in travelling. Nowadays they are not allowed to

become thirsty; and they are too car sick to care about eating. Car

sick? Certainly; just as you or I are car sick, no worse; only we do not

need to travel unless we want to. At the end of the journey, often, they

are too wobbly to stand up. This is not weakness, but dizziness from the

unwonted motion. Once a fool S.P.C.A. officer ordered a number of the

Captain's steers shot on the ground that they were too weak to live.

That greenhorn got into fifty-seven varieties of trouble.
Arrived at their journey's end the steers were permitted

[Pg 324]six to twelve

individuals. The man in charge had to know mules—which is no slight

degree of special wisdom; had to know loads; had to understand

conditioning. His lantern was the first to twinkle in the morning as he

doled out corn to his charges.
Then came the ruck of field hands of all types. The average field hand

in California is a cross between a hobo and a labourer. He works

probably about half the year. The other half he spends on the road,

tramping it from place to place. Like the common hobo, he begs his way

when he can; catches freight train rides; consorts in thickets with his

kind. Unlike the common hobo, however, he generally has money in his

pocket and always carries a bed-roll. The latter consists of a blanket

or so, or quilt, and a canvas strapped around the whole. You can see him

at any time plodding along the highways and railroads, the roll slung

across his back. He much appreciates a lift in your rig; and sometimes

proves worth the trouble. His labour raises him above the level

degradation of the ordinary tramp; the independence of his spirit gives

his point of view an originality; the nomadic stirring of his blood

keeps him going. In the course of years he has crossed the length and

breadth of the state a half dozen times. He has harvested apples in

Siskiyou and oranges in Riverside; he has chopped sugar pine in the

snows of the Sierras and manzanita on the blazing hillsides of San

Bernardino; he has garnered the wheat of the great Santa Clara Valley

and the alfalfa of San Fernando. And whenever the need for change or the

desire for a drink has struck him, he has drawn his pay, strapped his

bed roll, and cheerfully hiked away down the long and dusty trail.
[Pg 325]That is his chief defect as a field hand—his unreliability. He seems

to have no great pride in finishing out a job, although he is a good

worker while he is at it. The Captain used to send in the wagon to bring

men out, but refused absolutely to let any man ride in anything going

the other way. Nevertheless the hand, when the wanderlust hit him,

trudged cheerfully the long distance to town. I am not sure that a new

type is not thus developing, a type as distinct in its way as the

riverman or the cowboy. It is not as high a type, of course, for it has

not the strength either of sustained and earnest purpose nor of class

loyalty; but still it makes for new species. The California field hand

has mother-wit, independence, a certain reckless, you-be-damned courage,

a wandering instinct. He quits work not because he wants to loaf, but

because he wants to go somewhere else. He is always on the road

travelling, travelling, travelling. It is not hope of gain that takes

him, for in the scarcity of labour wages are as high here as there. It

is not desire for dissipation that lures him from labour; he drinks hard

enough, but the liquor is as potent here as two hundred miles away. He

looks you steadily enough in the eye; and he begs his bread and commits

his depredations half humorously, as though all this were fooling that

both you and he understood. What his impelling motive is, I cannot say;

nor whether he himself understands it, this restlessness that turns his

feet ever to the pleasant California highways, an Ishmael of the road.
But this very unreliability forces the ranchman to the next element in

our consideration of the ranch's people—the Orientals. They are good

workers, these little brown

[Pg 326]

and yellow men, and unobtrusive and

skilled. They do not quit until the job is done; they live frugally;

they are efficient. The only thing we have against them is that we are

afraid of them. They crowd our people out. Into a community they edge

themselves little by little. At the end of two years they have saved

enough capital to begin to buy land. At the end of ten years they have

taken up all the small farms from the whites who cannot or will not live

in competition with Oriental frugality. The valley, or cove, or flat has

become Japanese. They do not amalgamate. Their progeny are Japanese

unchanged; and their progeny born here are American citizens. In the

face of public sentiment, restriction, savage resentment they have made

head. They are continuing to make head. The effects are as yet small in

relation to the whole of the body politic; but more and more of the

fertile, beautiful little farm centres of California are becoming the

breeding grounds of Japanese colonies. As the pressure of population on

the other side increases, it is not difficult to foresee a result. We

are afraid of them.
The ranchmen know this. "We would use white labour," say they, "if we

could get it, and rely on it. But we cannot; and we must have labour!"

The debt of California to the Orientals can hardly be computed. The

citrus crop is almost entirely moved by them; and all other produce

depends so largely on them that it would hardly be an exaggeration to

say that without them a large part of the state's produce would rot in

fields. We do not want the Oriental; and yet we must have him, must have

more of him if we are to reach our fullest development. It is a dilemma;

a paradox.
[Pg 327]And yet, it seems to me, the paradox only exists because we will not

face facts in a commonsense manner. As I remember it, the original

anti-Oriental howl out here made much of the fact that the Chinaman and

Japanese saved his money and took it home with him. In the peculiar

circumstances we should not object to that. We cannot get our work done

by our own people; we are forced to hire in outsiders to do it; we

should expect, as a country, to pay a fair price for what we get. It is

undoubtedly more desirable to get our work done at home; but if we

cannot find the help, what more reasonable than that we should get it

outside, and pay for it? If we insist that the Oriental is a detriment

as a permanent resident, and if at the same time we need his labour,

what else is there to do but pay him and let him go when he has done his

job?
And he will go if pay is all he gets. Only when he is permitted to

settle down to his favourite agriculture in a fertile country does he

stay permanently. To be sure a certain number of him engages in various

other commercial callings, but that number bears always a very definite

proportion to the Oriental population in general. And it is harmless. It

is not absolute restriction of immigration we want—although I believe

immigration should be numerically restricted, but absolute prohibition

of the right to hold real estate. To many minds this may seem a denial

of the "equal rights of man." I doubt whether in some respects men have

equal rights. Certainly Brown has not an equal right with Jones to spank

Jones's small boy; nor do I believe the rights of any foreign nation

paramount to our own right to safeguard ourselves by proper legislation.
[Pg 328]These economics have taken us a long distance from the ranch and its

Orientals. The Japanese contingent were mainly occupied with the fruit,

possessing a peculiar deftness in pruning and caring for the prunes and

apricots. The Chinese had to do with irrigation and with the vegetables.

Their broad, woven-straw hats and light denim clothes lent the

particular landscape they happened for the moment to adorn a peculiarly

foreign and picturesque air.
And outside of these were various special callings represented by one or

two men: such as the stable men, the bee keeper, the blacksmith and

wagon-wright, the various cooks and cookees, the gardeners, the "varmint

catcher," and the like.
Nor must be forgotten the animals, both wild and tame. Old Ben and Young

Ben and Linn, the bird dogs; the dachshunds; the mongrels of the men's

quarters; all the domestic fowls; the innumerable and blue-blooded hogs;

the polo ponies and brood mares, the stud horses and driving horses and

cow horses, colts, yearlings, the young and those enjoying a peaceful

and honourable old age; Pollymckittrick; Redmond's cat and fifty others,

half-wild creatures; vireos and orioles in the trees around the house;

thousands and thousands of blackbirds rising in huge swarms like gnats;

full-voiced meadowlarks on the fence posts; herons stalking solemnly, or

waiting like so many Japanese bronzes for a chance at a gopher;

red-tailed hawks circling slowly; pigeon hawks passing with their falcon

dart; little gaudy sparrow hawks on top the telephone poles; buzzards,

stately and wonderful in flight, repulsive when at rest; barn-owls

dwelling in the haystacks, and horned [Pg 329]owls in the hollow trees; the

game in countless numbers; all the smaller animals and tiny birds in

species too numerous to catalogue, all these drew their full sustenance

of life from the ranch's smiling abundance.
And the mules; I must not forget them. I have the greatest respect for a

mule. He knows more than the horse; just as the goose or the duck knows

more than the chicken. Six days the mules on the ranch laboured; but on

the seventh they were turned out into the pastures to rest and roll and

stand around gossiping sociably, rubbing their long, ridiculous Roman

noses together, or switching the flies off one another with their

tasselled tails. Each evening at sunset all the various teams came in

from different directions, converging at the lane, and plodding dustily

up its length to the sheds and their night's rest. Five evenings thus

they come in silence. But on the sixth each and every mule lifted up his

voice in rejoicing over the morrow. The distant wayfarer—familiar with

ranch ways—hearing this strident, discordant, thankful chorus far

across the evening peace of the wide country, would thus have known this

was Saturday night, and that to-morrow was the Sabbath, the day of rest!

CHAPTER XIV
THE HEATHEN
This must be mainly discursive and anecdotal, for no one really knows

much more than externals concerning the Chinese. Some men there are,

generally reporters on the big dailies, who have been admitted to the

tongs; who can take you into the exclusive Chinese clubs; who are

everywhere in Chinatown greeted cordially, treated gratis to strange

food and drink, and patted on the back with every appearance of

affection. They can tell you of all sorts of queer, unknown customs and

facts, and can show you all sorts of strange and unusual things. Yet at

the last analysis these are also discursions and anecdotes. We gather

empirical knowledge: only rarely do we think we get a glimpse of how the

delicate machinery moves behind those twinkling eyes.
I am led to these remarks by the contemplation of Chinese Charley at the

ranch. He has been with Mrs. Kitty twenty-five years; he wears American

clothes; he speaks English with hardly a trace of either accent or

idiom; he has long since dropped the deceiving Oriental stolidity and

weeps out his violent Chinese rages unashamed. Yet even now Mrs. Kitty's

summing up is that Charley is a "queer old thing."
If you start out with a good Chinaman, you will always

[Pg 331]have good

Chinamen; if you draw a poor one, you will probably be cursed with a

succession of mediocrities. They pass you along from one to another of

the same "family"; and, short of the adoption of false whiskers and a

change of name, you can find no expedient to break the charm. When one

leaves of his own accord, he sends you another boy to take his place.

When he is discharged, he does identically that, although you may not

know it. Down through the list of Gins or Sings or Ungs you slide

comfortably or bump disagreeably according to your good fortune or

deserts.
Another feature to which you must become accustomed is that of the

Unexpected Departure. Everything is going smoothly, and you are engaged

in congratulating yourself. To you appears Ah Sing.
"I go San Flancisco two o'clock tlain," he remarks. And he does.
In vain do you point to the inconvenience of guests, the injustice thus

of leaving you in the lurch; in vain do you threaten detention of wages

due unless he gives you what your servant experience has taught you is a

customary "week's warning." He repeats his remark: and goes. At

two-fifteen another bland and smiling heathen appears at your door. He

may or may not tell you that Ah Sing sent him. Dinner is ready on time.

The household work goes on without a hitch or a tiniest jar.
"Ah Sing say you pay me his money," announces this new heathen.
If you are wise, you abandon your thoughts of fighting the outrage. You

pay over Ah Sing's arrears.
[Pg 332]"By the way," you inquire of your new retainer, "what's your name?"
"My name Lum Sing," the newcomer replies.
That is about the way such changes happen. If by chance you are in the

good graces of heathendom, you will be given an involved and fancy

reason for the departure. These generally have to do with the mysterious

movements of relatives.
"My second-uncle, he come on ship to San Flancisco. I got to show him

what to do," explains Ah Sing.
If they like you very much, they tell you they will come back at the end

of a month. They never do, and by the end of the month the new man has

so endeared himself to you that Ah Sing is only a pleasant memory.
The reasons for these sudden departures are two-fold as near as I can

make out. Ah Sing may not entirely like the place; or he may have

received orders from his tong to move on—probably the latter. If both

Ah Sing and his tong approve of you and the situation, he will stay with

you for many years. Our present man once remained but two days at a

place. The situation is an easy one; Toy did his work well; the

relations were absolutely friendly. After we had become intimate with

Toy, he confided to us his reasons:
"I don' like stay at place where nobody laugh," said he.
As servants the Chinese are inconceivably quick, deft, and clean. One

good man will do the work of two white servants, and do it better. Toy

takes care of us absolutely. He cooks, serves, does the housework, and

with it all manages to get off the latter part of the afternoon

[Pg 333]and

nearly every evening. At first, with recollections of the rigidly

defined "days off" of the East, I was a little inclined to look into

this. I did look into it; but when I found all the work done, without

skimping, I concluded that if the man were clever enough to save his

time, he had certainly earned it for himself. Systematizing and no false

moves proved to be his method.
Since this is so, it follows, quite logically and justly, that the

Chinese servant resents the minute and detailed supervision some

housewives delight in. Show him what you want done; let him do it;

criticize the result—but do not stand around and make suggestions and

offer amendments. Some housekeepers, trained to make of housekeeping an

end rather than a means, can never keep Chinese. This does not mean that

you must let them go at their own sweet will: only that you must try as

far as possible to do your criticizing and suggesting before or after

the actual performance.
I remember once Billy came home from some afternoon tea where she had

been talking to a number of "conscientious" housekeepers of the old

school until she had been stricken with a guilty feeling that she had

been loafing on the job. To be sure the meals were good, and on time;

the house was clean; the beds were made; and the comforts of life seemed

to be always neatly on hand; but what of that? The fact remained that

Billy had time to go horseback riding, to go swimming, to see her

friends, and to shoot at a mark. Every other housekeeper was busy from

morning until night; and then complained that somehow or other she never

could get finished up! It was evident that

[Pg 334]

somehow Billy was not doing

her full duty by the sphere to which woman was called, etc.
So home she came, resolved to do better. Toy was placidly finishing up

for the afternoon. Billy followed him around for a while, being a

housekeeper. Toy watched her with round, astonished eyes. Finally he

turned on her with vast indignation.
"Look here, Mis' White," said he. "What a matter with you? You talk just

like one old woman!"
Billy paused in her mad career and considered. That was just what she

was talking like. She laughed. Toy laughed. Billy went shooting.
After your Chinaman becomes well acquainted with you, he develops human

traits that are astonishing only in contrast to his former mask of

absolute stolidity. To the stranger the Oriental is as impassive and

inscrutable as a stone Buddha, so that at last we come to read his

attitude into his inner life, and to conclude him without emotion. This

is also largely true of the Indian. As a matter of fact, your heathen is

rather vividly alive inside. His enjoyment is keen, his curiosity

lively, his emotions near the surface. If you have or expect to have

visitors, you must tell Ah Sing all about them—their station in life,

their importance, and the like. He will listen, keenly interested,

gravely nodding his pig-tailed, shaven head. Then, if your visitors are

from the East, you inform them of what every Californian knows—that

each and every member of a household must say "good morning"

ceremoniously to Ah Sing. And Ah Sing will smile blandly and duck his

pig-tailed, shaven head, and wish each member "good

[Pg 335]

morning" back

again. It is sometimes very funny to hear the matin chorus of a dozen

people crying out their volley of salute to ceremony; and to hear again

the Chinaman's conscientious reply to each in turn down the long

table—"Good mo'ning, Mr. White; good mo'ning, Mis' White; good

mo'ning, Mr. Lewis——" and so on, until each has been remembered. There

are some families that, either from ignorance or pride, omit this and

kindred little human ceremonials. The omission is accepted; but that

family is never "my family" to the servant within its gates.
For your Chinaman is absolutely faithful and loyal and trustworthy. He

can be allowed to handle any amount of money for you. We ourselves are

away from home a great deal. When we get ready to go, we simply pack our

trunks and depart. Toy then puts away the silver and valuables and

places them in the bank vaults, closes the house, and puts all in order.

A week or so before our return we write him. Thereupon he cleans things

up, reclaims the valuables, rearranges everything. His wonderful Chinese

memory enables him to replace every smallest item exactly as it was. If

I happen to have left seven cents and an empty .38 cartridge on the

southwestern corner of the bureau, there they will be. It is difficult

to believe that affairs have been at all disturbed. Yet probably, if our

stay away has been of any length, everything in the house has been moved

or laid away.
Furthermore, Toy reads and writes English, and enjoys greatly sending us

wonderful and involved reports. One of them ended as follows: "The

weather is doing nicely,

[Pg 336]the place is safely well, and the dogs are

happy all the while." It brings to mind a peculiarly cheerful picture.
One of the familiar and persistent beliefs as to Chinese traits is that

they are a race of automatons. "Tell your Chinaman exactly what you want

done, and how you want it done," say your advisors, "for you will never

be able to change them once they get started." And then they will adduce

a great many amusing and true incidents to illustrate the point.
The facts of the case are undoubted, but the conclusions as to the

invariability of the Chinese mind are, in my opinion, somewhat

exaggerated.
It must be remembered that almost all Chinese customs and manners of

thought are the direct inverse of our own. When announcing or receiving

a piece of bad news, for example, it is with them considered polite to

laugh; while intense enjoyment is apt to be expressed by tears. The

antithesis can be extended almost indefinitely by the student of

Oriental manners. Contemplate, now, the condition of the young Chinese

but recently arrived. He is engaged by some family to do its housework;

and, as he is well paid and conscientious, he desires to do his best.

But in this he is not permitted to follow his education. Each, move he

makes in initiative is stopped and corrected. To his mind there seems no

earthly sense or logic in nine tenths of what we want; but he is willing

to do his best.
"Oh, well," says he to himself, "these people do things crazily; and no

well-regulated Chinese mind could possibly either anticipate how they

desire things done, or figure out

[Pg 337]

why they want them that way. I give

it up! I'll just follow things out exactly as I am told"—and he does

so!
This condition of affairs used to be more common than it is now. Under

the present exclusion law no fresh immigration is supposed to be

possible. Most of the Chinese servants are old timers, who have learned

white people's ways, and—what is more important—understand them. They

are quite capable of initiative; and much more intelligent than the

average white servant.
But a green Chinaman is certainly funny. He does things forever-after

just as you show him the first time; and a cataclysm of nature is

required to shake his purpose. Back in the middle 'eighties my father,

moving into a new house, dumped the ashes beside the kitchen steps

pending the completion of a suitable ash bin. When the latter had been

built, he had Gin Gwee move the ashes from the kitchen steps to the bin.

This happened to be of a Friday. Ever after Gin Gwee deposited the ashes

by the kitchen steps every day; and on Friday solemnly transferred them

to the ash bin! Nor could anything persuade him to desist.
Again he was given pail, soap, and brush, shown the front steps and walk

leading to the gate, and set to work. Gin Gwee disappeared. When we went

to hunt him up, we found him half way down the block, still scrubbing

away. I was in favour of letting him alone to see how far he would go,

but mother had other ideas as to his activities.
These stories could be multiplied indefinitely; and are detailed by the

dozen as proof of the "stupidity" of the Chinese. The Chinese are

anything but stupid; and, as I

[Pg 338]

have said before, when once they have

grasped the logic of the situation, can figure out a case with the best

of them.
They are, however, great sticklers for formalism; and disapprove of any

short cuts in ceremony. As soon leave with the silver as without waiting

for the finger bowls. A friend of mine, training a new man by example,

as new men of this nationality are always trained, was showing him how

to receive a caller. Therefore she rang her own doorbell, presented a

card; in short, went through the whole performance. Tom understood

perfectly. That same afternoon Mrs. G——, a next-door neighbour and

intimate friend, ran over for a chat. She rang the bell. Tom appeared.
"Is Mrs. B—— at home?" inquired the friend.
Tom planted himself square in the doorway. He surveyed her with a cold

and glittering eye.
"You got ticket?" he demanded. "You no got ticket, you no come in!"
On another occasion two ladies came to call on Mrs. B—— but by mistake

blundered to the kitchen door. Mrs. B——'s house is a bungalow and on a

corner. Tom appeared.
"Is Mrs. B—— at home?" they asked.
"This kitchen door; you go front door," requested Tom, politely.
The callers walked around the house to the proper door, rang, and

waited. After a suitable interval Tom appeared again.
"Is Mrs. B—— at home?" repeated the visitors.

[Pg 339]"No, Mrs. B—— she gone out," Tom informed them. The proper

ceremonials had been fulfilled.
To one who appreciates what he can do, and how well he does it; who can

value absolute faithfulness and honesty; who confesses a sneaking

fondness for the picturesque as nobly exemplified in a clean and

starched or brocaded heathen; who understands how to balance the

difficult poise, supervision, and interference, the Chinese servant is

the best on the continent. But to one who enjoys supervising every step

or who likes well-trained ceremony, "good form" in minutiæ, and the

deference of our kind of good training the heathen is likely to prove

disappointing. When you ring your friend's door-bell, you are quite apt

to be greeted by a cheerful and smiling "hullo!" I think most

Californians rather like the entirely respectful but freshly

unconventional relationship that exists between the master and his

Chinese servant. I do.[H]

[Pg 340]
CHAPTER XV
THE LAST HUNT
Of all ranch visits the last day neared. Always we forgot it until the

latest possible moment; for we did not like to think of it. Then, when

the realization could be no longer denied, we planned a grand day just

to finish up on. The telephone's tiny, thin voice returned acceptances

from distant neighbours; so bright and early we waited at the

cross-roads rendezvous.
And from the four directions they came, jogging along in carts or

spring-wagons, swaying swiftly in automobiles whose brass flashed back

the early sun. As each vehicle drew up, the greetings flew, charged

electrically with the dry, chaffing humour of the out of doors. When we

finally climbed the fence into the old cornfield we were almost a dozen.

There were the Captain, Uncle Jim, and myself from the ranch; and T and

his three sons and two guests from Stockdale ranch; the sporting parson

of the entire neighbourhood, and Dodge and his three beautiful dogs.
Spread out in a rough line we tramped away through the dried and

straggling ranks of the Egyptian corn. Quail buzzed all around us like

angry hornets. We did not fire a shot. Each had his limit of twenty-five

still before him, and each wanted to have all the fun he could out of

getting them. Shooting quail in Egyptian corn is, com

[Pg 341]

paratively

speaking, not much fun. We joked each other, and whistled and sang, and

trudged manfully along, gun over shoulder. The pale sun was

strengthening; the mountains were turning darker as they threw aside the

filmy rose of early day; in treetops a row of buzzards sat, their wings

outspread like the heraldic devices of a foreign nation. Thousands of

doves whistled away; thousands of smaller birds rustled and darted

before our advancing lines; tens of thousands of blackbirds sprinkled

the bare branches of single trees, uttering the many-throated multitude

call; underneath all this light and joyous life the business-like little

quail darted away in their bullet flight.
Always they bore across our front to the left; for on that side,

paralleling our course, ran a long ravine or "dry slough." It was about

ten feet deep on the average, probably thirty feet wide, and was densely

grown with a tangle of willows, berry vines, creepers, wild grape, and

the like. Into this the quail pitched.
By the time we had covered the mile length of that cornfield we had

dumped an unguessable number of quail into that slough.
Then we walked back the entire distance—still with our guns over our

shoulders—but this time along the edge of the ravine. We shouted and

threw clods, and kicked on the trees, and rattled things, urging the

hidden quail once more to flight. The thicket seemed alive with them. We

caught glimpses as they ran before us, pacing away at a great rate,

their feathers sleek and trim; they buzzed away at bewildering pitches

and angles; they sprang into the tops of bushes, cocking their head

plumes forward. Their various clicking

[Pg 342]

undercalls, chatterings, and

chirrings filled the thicket as full of sound as of motion. And in the

middle distance before and behind us they mocked us with their calls.
"You can't shoot! You can't shoot!"
Some of them flew ever ahead, some of them doubled-back and dropped into

the slough behind us; but a proportion broke through the thicket and

settled in the wide fields on the other side. After them we went, and

for the first time opened our guns and slipped the yellow shells into

the barrels.
For this field on the other side was the wide, open plain; and it was

grown over by tiny, half-knee high thickets of tumbleweed with here and

there a trifle of sagebrush. Between these miniature thickets wound

narrow strips of sandy soil, like streams and bays and estuaries in

shape. We knew that the quail would lie well here, for they hate to

cross bare openings.
Therefore, we threw out our skirmish line, and the real advance in force

began.
Every man retrieved his own birds, a matter of some difficulty in the

tumbleweed. While one was searching, the rest would get ahead of him.

The line became disorganized, broke into groups, finally disintegrated

entirely. Each man hunted for himself, circling the tumbleweed patches,

combing carefully their edges for the quail that sometimes burst into

the air fairly at his feet. When he had killed one, he walked directly

to the spot. On the way he would flush two or three more. They were

tempting; but we were old hands at the sport, and we knew only too well

that if we yielded so far as to shoot a second before we had picked up

[Pg 343]

the first, the probabilities were strong that the first would never be

found. In this respect such shooting requires good judgment. It is

generally useless to try to shoot a double, even though a dozen easy

shots are in the air at once; and yet, occasionally, on a day when

Koos-ey-oonek is busy elsewhere, it may happen that the birds flush

across a wide, bare space. It is well to keep a weather eye open for

such chances.
With a green crowd and in different cover such shooting might have been

dangerous; but with an abundance of birds, in this wide, open prairie,

cool heads knew enough to keep wide apart and to look before they shot.

The fun grew fast and furious; and the guns popped away like

firecrackers. In fact, the fun grew a little too fast and furious to

suit Dodge.
Dodge had beautiful and well-trained dogs. Ordinarily any one of us

would have esteemed it a high privilege to shoot over them. In fact, I

have often declared myself to the effect that of the three elements of

pleasure comprehended in field shooting that of working the dogs was the

chief. Just as it is better to catch one yellowtail on a nine-ounce rod

than twenty on a hand line, so it is better to kill one quail over a

well-trained dog than a half dozen "Walking 'em up." But this particular

case was different. We were out for a high old time; and part of a high

old time was a wild and reckless disregard of inhibitive sporting

conventions. The birds were here literally in thousands. Not a third had

left the slough for this open country; we could not shoot at a tenth of

those flushed, yet the guns were popping continuously. Everybody was

shooting and laughing and

[Pg 344]

running about. The game was to pelt away,

retrieve your bird as quickly as you could, and pelt away again. The

dogs, working up to their points carefully and stylishly, as good dogs

should, were being constantly left in the rear. They drew down to their

points—and behold nobody but their devoted master would pay any

attention to their bird! Everybody else was engaged busily in popping

away at any one of the dozen-odd other birds to be had for the

selection!
Poor Dodge, being somewhat biased by the accident of ownership, looked

on us as a lot of barbarians—as, for the time being, we were; nice,

happy barbarians having a good time. He worked his dogs conscientiously,

and muttered in his beard. The climax came when, in the joyous

excitement of the occasion, someone threw out a chance remark on "those

—— dogs" being in the way. Then Dodge withdrew with dignity. Having a

fellow-feeling as a dog-handler I went over to console him. He was

inconsolable; and so remained until after lunch.
In this manner we made our way slowly down the length of the slough, and

then slowly back again. Of the birds originally flushed from the

Egyptian corn into the thicket but a small proportion had left that

thicket for the open country of the tumbleweed and sage; and of the

latter we had been able to shoot at a very, very small percentage.

Nevertheless, when we emptied our pockets, we found that each had made

his bag. We counted them out, throwing them into one pile.
"Twenty-four," counted the Captain.
"Twenty-four," Tom enumerated.
"Twenty-four," Uncle Jim followed him.
[Pg 345]We each had twenty-four. And then it developed that every man had saved

just one bird of his limit until after lunch. No one wanted to be left

out of all the shooting while the rest filled their bags; and no one

had believed that anybody but himself had come so close to the limit.
So we laughed, and shouldered our guns, and trudged across country to

the clump of cottonwood where already the girls had spread lunch.
That was a good lunch. We sat under shady trees, and the sunlit plains

stretched away and away to distant calm mountains. Near at hand the

sparse gray sagebrush reared its bonneted heads; far away it blurred

into a monochrome where the plains lifted and flowed molten into the

cañons and crevices of the foothills. Numberless crows, blackbirds, and

wildfowl crossed and recrossed the very blue sky. A gray jackrabbit,

thinking himself concealed by a very creditable imitation of a

sacatone hummock, sat motionless not seventy yards away.
After lunch we moved out leisurely to get our one bird apiece. Some of

the girls followed us. We were now epicures of shooting, and each let

many birds pass before deciding to fire. Some waited for cross shots,

some for very easy shots, some for the most difficult shots possible.

Each suited his fancy.
"I'm all in," remarked each, as he pocketed his bird; and followed to

see the others finish.

Next day, our baggage piled in most anywhere, our farewells all said, we

bowled away toward town in the brand-new machine. Redmond sat in the

front seat with the chauffeur.

[Pg 346]

It was his first experience in an

automobile, and he sat very rigidly upright, eyes front, his moustaches

bristling.
Now at a certain point on the road lived a large black dog—just plain

ranch dog—who was accustomed to come bounding out to the road to run

alongside and bark for an appropriate interval. This was an unvarying

ceremony. He was a large and prancing dog; and, I suppose from his

appearance, must have been named Carlo. In the course of our many visits

to the ranch we grew quite fond of the dog, and always looked as hard

for him to come out as he did for us to come along.
This day also the dog came forth; but now he had no steady-trotting

ranch team to greet. The road was smooth and straight, and the car was

hitting thirty-five miles an hour. The dog bounded confidently down the

front walk, leaping playfully in the air, opened his mouth to bark—and,

behold! the vehicle was not within range any more, but thirty yards away

and rapidly departing. So Carlo shut his mouth and got down to business.

For three hundred yards he managed to keep pace alongside; but the

effort required all his forces; not once did he manage to gather wind

for even a single bark.
Redmond in the front seat sat straighter than ever. From his lordly

elevation he waved a lordly hand at the poor dog.
"Useless! Useless!" said he, loftily.
And looking back at the dog seated panting in a rapidly disappearing

distance, we saw that he also knew that the Old Order had changed.
