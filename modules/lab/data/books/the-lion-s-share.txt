CHAPTER I
MISS INGATE, AND THE YACHT
Audrey had just closed the safe in her father’s study when

she was startled by a slight noise. She turned like a

defensive animal to face danger. It had indeed occurred

to her that she was rather like an animal in captivity, and

she found a bitter pleasure in the idea, though it was not

at all original.
“And Flank Hall is my Zoo!” she had said. (Not

that she had ever seen the Zoological Gardens or visited

London.)
She was lithe; she moved with charm. Her short, plain

blue serge walking-frock disclosed the form of her limbs

and left them free, and it made her look younger even

than she was. Its simplicity suited her gestures and took

grace from them. But she wore the old thing without the

least interest in it—almost unconsciously. She had none of

the preoccupations caused by the paraphernalia of existence.

She scarcely knew what it was to own. She was aware only

of her body and her soul. Beyond these her possessions

were so few, so mean, so unimportant, that she might have

carried them to the grave and into heaven without protest

from the authorities earthly or celestial.
The slight noise was due to the door of the study,

which great age had distorted and bereft of sense, and, in

fact, almost unhinged. It unlatched itself, paused, and

then calmly but firmly swung wide open. When it could

swing no farther it shook, vibrating into repose.
Audrey condemned the door for a senile lunatic, and

herself for a poltroon. She became defiant of peril, until

the sound of a step on the stair beyond the door threw

her back into alarm. But when the figure of Miss Ingate

appeared in the doorway she was definitely reassured, to

the point of disdain. All her facial expression said: “It’s

only Miss Ingate.”
And yet Miss Ingate was not a negligible woman. Her

untidy hair was greying; she was stout, she was fifty, she

was plain, she had not elegance; her accent and turns of

speech were noticeably those of Essex. But she had a

magnificent pale forehead; the eyes beneath it sparkled

with energy, inquisitiveness, and sagacity; and the mouth

beneath the eyes showed by its sardonic dropping corners

that she had come to a settled, cheerful conclusion about

human nature, and that the conclusion was not flattering.

Miss Ingate was a Guardian of the Poor, and the Local

Representative of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Families Association.

She had studied intimately the needy and the rich

and the middling. She was charitable without illusions;

and, while adhering to every social convention, she did so

with a toleration pleasantly contemptuous; in her heart she

had no mercy for snobs of any kind, though, unfortunately,

she was at times absurdly intimidated by them—at other

times she was not.
To the west, within a radius of twelve miles, she knew

everybody and everybody knew her; to the east her fame

was bounded only by the regardless sea. She and her

ancestors had lived in the village of Moze as long as even

Mr. Mathew Moze and his ancestors. In the village, and

to the village, she was Miss Ingate, a natural phenomenon,

like the lie of the land and the river Moze. Her opinions

offended nobody, not Mr. Moze himself—she was Miss

Ingate. She was laughed at, beloved and respected. Her

sagacity had one flaw, and the flaw sprang from her sincere

conviction that human nature in that corner of Essex,

which she understood so profoundly, and where she was

so perfectly at home, was different from, and more fondly

foolish than, human nature in any other part of the world.

She could not believe that distant populations could be

at once so pathetically and so naughtily human as the

population in and around Moze.
If Audrey disdained Miss Ingate, it was only because

Miss Ingate was neither young nor fair nor the proprietress

of some man, and because people made out that she was

peculiar. In some respects Audrey looked upon Miss

Ingate as a life-belt, as the speck of light at the end of a

tunnel, as the enigmatic smile which glimmers always in

the frown of destiny.
“Well?” cried Miss Ingate in her rather shrill voice,

grinning sardonically, with the corners of her lips still lower

than usual in anticipatory sarcasm. It was as if she had

said: “You cannot surprise me by any narrative of imbecility

or turpitude or bathos. All the same, I am dying

to hear the latest eccentricity of this village.”
“Well?” parried Audrey, holding one hand behind her.
They did not shake hands. People who call at ten

o’clock in the morning cannot expect to have their hands

shaken. Miss Ingate certainly expected nothing of the

sort. She had the freedom of Flank Hall, as of scores

of other houses, at all times of day. Servants opened front

doors for her with a careless smile, and having shut

front doors they left her loose, like a familiar cat, to find

what she wanted. They seldom “showed” her into any

room, nor did they dream of acting before her the unconvincing

comedy of going to “see” whether masters or

mistresses were out or in.
“Where’s your mother?” asked Miss Ingate idly, quite

sure that interesting divulgations would come, and quite

content to wait for them. She had been out of the village

for over a week.
“Mother’s taking her acetyl salicylic,” Audrey answered,

coming to the door of the study.
This meant merely that Mrs. Moze had a customary

attack of the neuralgia for which the district is justly

renowned among strangers.
“Oh!” murmured Miss Ingate callously. Mrs. Moze,

though she had lived in the district for twenty-five years,

did not belong to it. If she chose to keep on having

neuralgia, that was her affair, but in justice to natives

and to the district she ought not to make too much of it,

and she ought to admit that it might well be due to her

weakness after her operation. Miss Ingate considered the

climate to be the finest in England; which it was, on the

condition that you were proof against neuralgia.
“Father’s gone to Colchester in the car to see the

Bishop,” Audrey coldly added.
“If I’d known he was going to Colchester I should

have asked him for a lift,” said Miss Ingate, with

determination.
“Oh, yes! He’d have taken you!“ said Audrey, reserved.

“I suppose you had fine times in London!”
“Oh! It was vehy exciting! It was vehy exciting!”

Miss Ingate agreed loudly.
“Father wouldn’t let me read about it in the paper,”

said Audrey, still reserved. “He never will, you know.

But I did!”
“Oh! But you didn’t read about me playing the barrel

organ all the way down Regent Street, because that wasn’t

in any of the papers.”
“You didn’t!“ Audrey protested, with a sudden dark

smile.
“Yes, I did. Yes, I did. Yes, I did. And vehy tiring

it was. Vehy tiring indeed. It’s quite an art to turn a

barrel organ. If you don’t keep going perfectly even it

makes the tune jerky. Oh! I know a bit about barrel

organs now. They smashed it all to pieces. Oh yes! All

to pieces. I spoke to the police. I said, ‘Aren’t you going

to protect these ladies’ property?’ But they didn’t lift a

finger.”
“And weren’t you arrested?”
“Me!” shrieked Miss Ingate. “Me arrested!” Then

more quietly, in an assured tone, “Oh no! I wasn’t

arrested. You see, as soon as the row began I just walked

away from the organ and became one of the crowd. I’m all

for them, but I wasn’t going to be arrested.”
Miss Ingate’s sparkling eyes seemed to say: “Sylvia

Pankhurst can be arrested if she likes, and so can Mrs.

Despard and Annie Kenney and Jane Foley, or any of them.

But the policeman that is clever enough to catch Miss

Ingate of Moze does not exist. And the gumption of Miss

Ingate of Moze surpasses the united gumption of all the

other feminists in England.”
“Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!” repeated Miss Ingate with

mingled complacency, glee, passion, and sardonic tolerance

of the whole panorama of worldly existence. “The police

were awful, shocking. But I was not arrested.”
“Well, I was—this morning,” said Audrey in a low and

poignant voice.
Miss Ingate was startled out of her mood of the detached

ironic spectator.
“What?” she frowned.
They heard a servant moving about at the foot of the

stairs, and a capped head could be seen through the

interstices of the white Chinese balustrade. The study was

the only immediate refuge; Miss Ingate advanced right into

it, and Audrey pushed the door to.
“Father’s given me a month’s C.B.”
Miss Ingate, gazing at the girl’s face, saw in its quiet

and yet savage desperation the possibility that after all she

might indeed be surprised by the vagaries of human nature

in the village. And her glance became sympathetic, even

tender, as well as apprehensive.
“‘C.B.’? What do you mean—‘C.B.’?”
“Don’t you know what C.B. means?” exclaimed Audrey

with scornful superiority over the old spinster. “Confined to

barracks. Father says I’m not to go beyond the grounds for

a month. And to-day’s the second of April!”
“No!”
“Yes, he does. He’s given me a week, you know, before.

Now it’s a month.”
Silence fell.
Miss Ingate looked round at the shabby study, with its

guns, cigar-boxes, prints, books neither old nor new,

japanned boxes of documents, and general litter scattered

over the voluted walnut furniture. Her own house was old-fashioned,

and she realised it was old-fashioned; but

when she came into Flank Hall, and particularly into Mr.

Moze’s study, she felt as if she was stepping backwards

into history—and this in spite of the fact that nothing

in the place was really ancient, save the ceilings and the

woodwork round the windows. It was Mr. Moze’s habit of

mind that dominated and transmogrified the whole interior,

giving it the quality of a mausoleum. The suffragette procession

in which Miss Ingate had musically and discreetly

taken part seemed to her as she stood in Mr. Moze’s changeless

lair to be a phantasm. Then she looked at the young

captive animal and perceived that two centuries may coincide

on the same carpet and that time is merely a convention.
“What you been doing?” she questioned, with delicacy.
“I took a strange man by the hand,” said Audrey,

choosing her words queerly, as she sometimes did, to produce

a dramatic effect.
“This morning?”
“Yes. Eight o’clock.”
“What? Is there a strange man in the village?”
“You don’t mean to say you haven’t seen the yacht!”
“Yacht?” Miss Ingate showed some excitement.
“Come and look, Winnie,” said Audrey, who occasionally

thought fit to address Miss Ingate in the manner of the

elder generation. She drew Miss Ingate to the window.
Between the brown curtains Mozewater, the broad,

shallow estuary of the Moze, was spread out glittering in

the sunshine which could not get into the chilly room. The

tide was nearly at full, and the estuary looked like a mighty

harbour for great ships; but in six hours it would be

reduced to a narrow stream winding through mud flats of

marvellous ochres, greens, and pinks. In the hazy distance

a fitful white flash showed where ocean waves were breaking

on a sand-bank. And in the foreground, against a disused

Hard that was a couple of hundred yards lower down than

the village Hard, a large white yacht was moored, probably

the largest yacht that had ever threaded that ticklish

navigation. She was a shallow-draft barge-yacht, rigged

like a Thames barge, and her whiteness and the glint of her

brass, and the flicker of her ensign at the stern were

dazzling. Blue figures ran busily about on her, and a white-and-blue

person in a peaked cap stood importantly at the

wheel.
“She was on the mud last night,” said Audrey eagerly,

“opposite the Flank buoy, and she came up this morning at

half-flood. I think they made fast at Lousey Hard, because

they couldn’t get any farther without waiting. They have

a motor, and it must be their first trip this season. I was

on the dyke. I wasn’t even looking at them, but they called

me, so I had to go. They only wanted to know if Lousey

Hard was private. Of course I told them it wasn’t. It was

a very middle-aged man spoke to me. He must be the

owner. As soon as they were tied up he wanted to jump

ashore. It was rather awkward, and I just held out my

hand to help him. Father saw me from here. I might have

known he would.”
“Why! It’s going off!” exclaimed Miss Ingate.
The yacht swung slowly round, held by her stern to the

Hard. Then the last hawser was cast off, and she floated

away on the first of the ebb; and as she moved, her main-sail,

unbrailed, spread itself out and became a vast pinion.

Like a dream of happiness she lessened and faded, and

Lousey Hard was as lonely and forlorn as ever.
“But didn’t you explain to your father?” Miss Ingate

demanded of Audrey.
“Of course I did. But he wouldn’t listen. He never

does. I might just as well have explained to the hall-clock.

He raged. I think he enjoys losing his temper. He said I

oughtn’t to have been there at all, and it was just like me,

and he couldn’t understand it in a daughter of his, and it

would be a great shock to my poor mother, and he’d talked

enough—he should now proceed to action. All the usual

things. He actually asked me who ‘the man’ was.”
“And who was it?”
“How can I tell? For goodness’ sake don’t go imitating

father, Winnie! ... Rather a dull man, I should say.

Rather like father, only not so old. He had a beautiful

necktie; I think it must have been made out of a strip of

Joseph’s coat.”
Miss Ingate giggled at a high pitch, and Audrey responsively

smiled.
“Oh dear! Oh dear!” murmured Miss Ingate when her

giggling was exhausted. “How queer it is that a girl like

you can’t keep your father in a good temper!”
“Father hates me to say funny things. If I say anything

funny he turns as black as ink—and he takes care to

keep gloomy all the rest of the day, too. He never laughs.

Mother laughs now and then, but I never heard father laugh.

Oh yes, I did. He laughed when the cat fell out of the bathroom

window on to the lawn-roller. He went quite red in

the face with laughing.... I say, Miss Ingate, do you

think father’s mad?”
“I shouldn’t think he’s what you call mad,” replied Miss

Ingate judicially, with admirable sang-froid. “I’ve known

so many peculiar people in my time. And you must remember,

Audrey, this is a peculiar part of the world.”
“Well, I believe he’s mad, anyway. I believe he’s got

men on the brain, especially young men. He’s growing

worse. Yesterday he told me I musn’t have the punt out on

Mozewater this season unless he’s with me. Fancy skiffing

about with father! He says I’m too old for that now. So

there you are. The older I get the less I’m allowed to do.

I can’t go a walk, unless it’s an errand. The pedal is off

my bike, and father is much too cunning to have it repaired.

I can’t boat. I’m never given any money. He grumbles

frightfully if I want any clothes, so I never want any.

That’s my latest dodge. I’ve read every book in the house

except the silly liturgical and legal things he’s always

having from the London Library—and I’ve read even some

of those. He won’t buy any new music. Golf! Ye gods,

Winnie, you should hear him talk about ladies and golf!”
“I have,” said Miss Ingate. “But it doesn’t ruffle me,

because I don’t play.”
“But he plays with girls, and young girls, too, all the

same. He’s been caught in the act. Ethel told me. He

little thinks I know. He’d let me play if he could be

the only man on the course. He’s mad about me and

men. He never looks at me without thinking of all the

boys in the district.”
“But he’s really very fond of you, Audrey.”
“Yes, I know,” said Audrey. “He ought to keep me in

the china cupboard.”
“Well, it’s a great problem.”
“He’s invented a beautiful new trick for keeping me in

when he’s out. I have to copy his beastly Society letters for

him.”
“I see he’s got a new box,” observed Miss Ingate,

glancing into the open cupboard in which stood the safe.

On the top of the safe were two japanned boxes, each

lettered in white: “The National Reformation Society.”

The uppermost box was freshly unpacked and shone with all

the intact pride of virginity.
“You should read some of the letters. You really

should, Winnie,” said Audrey. “All the bigwigs of the

Society love writing to each other. I bet you father will

get a typewriting machine this year, and make me learn it.

The chairman has a typewriter, and father means to be the

next chairman. You’ll see.... Oh! What’s that?

Listen!”
“What’s what?”
A faint distant throbbing could be heard.
“It’s the motor! He’s coming back for something.

Fly out of here, Winnie, fly!”
Audrey felt sick at the thought that if her father had

returned only a few minutes earlier he might have trapped

her at the safe itself. She still kept one hand behind her.
Miss Ingate, who with all her qualities was rather easily

flustered, ran out of the dangerous room in Audrey’s wake.

They met Mr. Mathew Moze at the half-landing of the stairs.
He was a man of average size, somewhat past sixty

years. He had plump cheeks, tinged with red; his hair,

moustache and short, full beard, were quite grey. He wore

a thick wide-spreading ulster, and between his coat and

waistcoat a leather vest, and on his head a grey cap. Put

him in the Strand in town clothes, and he might have been

taken for a clerk, a civil servant, a club secretary, a retired

military officer, a poet, an undertaker—for anything except

the last of a long line of immovable squires who could not

possibly conceive what it was not to be the owner of land.

His face was preoccupied and overcast, but as soon as he

realised that Miss Ingate was on the stairs it instantly

brightened into a warm and rather wistful smile.
“Good morning, Miss Ingate,” he greeted her with

deferential cordiality. “I’m so glad to see you back.”
“Good morning, good morning, Mr. Moze,” responded

Miss Ingate. “Vehy nice of you. Vehy nice of you.”
Nobody would have guessed from their demeanour that

they differed on every subject except their loyalty to that

particular corner of Essex, that he regarded her and her

political associates as deadly microbes in the national

organism, and that she regarded him as a nincompoop

crossed with a tyrant. Each of them had a magic glass to

see in the other nothing but a local Effendi and familiar

guardian angel of Moze. Moreover, Mr. Moze’s public

smile and public manner were irresistible—until he lost his

temper. He might have had friends by the score, had it

not been for his deep constitutional reserve—due partly to

diffidence and partly to an immense hidden conceit. Mr.

Moze’s existence was actuated, though he knew it not, by

the conviction that the historic traditions of England were

committed to his keeping. Hence the conceit, which was

that of a soul secretly self-dedicated.
Audrey, outraged by the hateful hypocrisy of persons

over fifty, and terribly constrained and alarmed, turned

vaguely back up the stairs. Miss Ingate, not quite knowing

what she did, with an equal vagueness followed her.
“Come in. Do come in,” urged Mr. Moze at the door

of the study.
Audrey, who remained on the landing, heard her elders

talk smoothly of grave Mozian things, while Mr. Moze

unlocked the new tin box above the safe.
“I’d forgotten a most important paper,” said he, as

he relocked the box. “I have an appointment with the

Bishop of Colchester at ten-forty-five, and I fear I may

be late. Will you excuse me, Miss Ingate?”
She excused him.
Departing, he put the paper into his pocket with a

careful and loving gesture that well symbolised his passionate

affection for the Society of which he was already

the vice-chairman. He had been a member of the National

Reformation Society for eleven years. Despite the promise

of its name, this wealthy association of idealists had no

care for reforms in a sadly imperfect England. Its aim

was anti-Romanist. The Reformation which it had in mind

was Luther’s, and it wished, by fighting an alleged insidious

revival of Roman Catholicism, to make sure that so far as

England was concerned Luther had not preached in vain.
Mr. Moze’s connection with the Society had originated

in a quarrel between himself and a Catholic priest from

Ipswich who had instituted a boys’ summer camp on the

banks of Mozewater near the village of Moze. Until that

quarrel, the exceeding noxiousness of the Papal doctrine

had not clearly presented itself to Mr. Moze. In such

strange ways may an ideal come to birth. As Mr. Moze,

preoccupied and gloomy once more, steered himself rapidly

out of Moze towards the episcopal presence, the image of

the imperturbable and Jesuitical priest took shape in his

mind, refreshing his determination to be even with Rome

at any cost.

CHAPTER II
THE THIEF’S PLAN WRECKED
“The fact is,” said Audrey, “father has another woman

in the house now.”
Mr. Moze had left Miss Ingate in the study and Audrey

had cautiously rejoined her there.
“Another woman in the house!” repeated Miss Ingate,

sitting down in happy expectation. “What on earth do

you mean? Who on earth do you mean?”
“I mean me.”
“You aren’t a woman, Audrey.”
“I’m just as much of a woman as you are. All father’s

behaviour proves it.”
“But your father treats you as a child.”
“No, he doesn’t. He treats me as a woman. If he

thought I was a child he wouldn’t have anything to worry

about. I’m over nineteen.”
“You don’t look it.”
“Of course I don’t. But I could if I liked. I simply

won’t look it because I don’t care to be made ridiculous.

I should start to look my age at once if father stopped

treating me like a child.”
“But you’ve just said he treats you as a woman!”
“You don’t understand, Winnie,” said the girl sharply.

“Unless you’re pretending. Now you’ve never told me

anything about yourself, and I’ve always told you lots about

myself. You belong to an old-fashioned family. How

were you treated when you were my age?”
“In what way?”
“You know what way,” said Audrey, gazing at her.
“Well, my dear. Things seemed to come very naturally,

somehow.”
“Were you ever engaged?”
“Me? Oh, no!” answered Miss Ingate with tranquillity.

“I’m vehy interested in them. Oh, vehy! Oh,

vehy! And I like talking to them. But anything more

than that gets on my nerves. My eldest sister was the

one. Oh! She was the one. She refused eleven men,

and when she was going to be married she made me

embroider the monograms of all of them on the skirt of her

wedding-dress. She made me, and I had to do it. I sat up

all night the night before the wedding to finish them.”
“And what did the bridegroom say about it?”
“The bridegroom didn’t say anything about it because

he didn’t know. Nobody knew except Arabella and me.

She just wanted to feel that the monograms were on her

dress, that was all.”
“How strange!”
“Yes, it was. But this is a vehy strange part of the

world.”
“And what happened afterwards?”
“Bella died when she had her first baby, and the baby

died as well. And the father’s dead now, too.”
“What a horrid story, Winnie!” Audrey murmured.

And after a pause: “I like your sister.”
“She was vehy uncommon. But I liked her too. I

don’t know why, but I did. She could make the best

marmalade I ever tasted in my born days.”
“I could make the best marmalade you ever tasted in

your born days,” said Audrey, sinking neatly to the floor

and crossing her legs, “but they won’t let me.”
“Won’t let you! But I thought you did all sorts of

things in the house.”
“No, Winnie. I only do one thing. I do as I’m

told—and not always even that. Now, if I wanted to

make the best marmalade you ever tasted in your born

days, first of all there would be a fearful row about the

oranges. Secondly, father would tell mother she must tell

me exactly what I was to do. He would also tell cook.

Thirdly and lastly, dear friends, he would come into the

kitchen himself. It wouldn’t be my marmalade at all. I

should only be a marmalade-making machine. They never

let me have any responsibility—no, not even when mother’s

operation was on—and I’m never officially free. The kitchen-maid

has far more responsibility than I have. And she

has an evening off and an afternoon off. She can write a

letter without everybody asking her who she’s writing to.

She’s only seventeen. She has the morning postman for

a young man now, and probably one or two others that

I don’t know of. And she has money and she buys her

own clothes. She’s a very naughty, wicked girl, and I

wish I was in her place. She scorns me, naturally. Who

wouldn’t?”
Miss Ingate said not a word. She merely sat with her

hands in the lap of her spotted pale-blue dress, faintly

and sadly smiling.
Audrey burst out:
“Miss Ingate, what can I do? I must do something.

What can I do?”
Miss Ingate shook her head, and put her lips tightly

together, while mechanically smoothing the sides of her

grey coat.
“I don’t know,” she said. “It beats me.”
“Then I’ll tell you what I can do!” answered Audrey

firmly, wriggling somewhat nearer to her along the floor.

“And what I shall do.”
“What?”
“Will you promise to keep it a secret?”
Miss Ingate nodded, smiling and showing her teeth.

Her broad polished forehead positively shone with kindly

eagerness.
“Will you swear?”
Miss Ingate hesitated, and then nodded again.
“Then put your hand on my head and say, ‘I swear.’”
Miss Ingate obeyed.
“I shall leave this house,” said Audrey in a low voice.
“You won’t, Audrey!”
“I’ll eat my hand off if I’ve not left this house by

to-morrow, anyway.”
“To-morrow!” Miss Ingate nearly screamed. “Now,

Audrey, do reflect. Think what you are!”
Audrey bounded to her feet.
“That’s what father’s always saying,” she exploded

angrily. “He’s always telling me to examine myself. The

fact is, I know too much about myself. I know exactly

the kind of girl it is who’s going to leave this house.

Exactly!”
“Audrey, you frighten me. Where are you going to?”
“London.”
“Oh! That’s all right then. I am relieved. I thought

perhaps you waited to come to my house. You won’t

get to London, because you haven’t any money.”
“Oh, yes, I have. I’ve got a hundred pounds.”
“Where?”
“Remember, you’ve sworn.... Here!” she cried

suddenly, and drawing her hand from behind her

back she most sensationally displayed a crushed roll of

bank-notes.
“And who did you get those from?”
“I didn’t get them from anybody. I got them out of

father’s safe. They’re his reserve. He keeps them right

at the back of the left-hand drawer, and he’s so sure

they’re there that he never looks for them. He thinks

he’s a perfect model, but really he’s careless. There’s a

duplicate key to the safe, you know, and he leaves it

with a lot of other keys loose in his desk. I expect he

thought nobody would ever dream of guessing it was a

key of the safe. I know he never looked at this roll,

because I’ve been opening the safe every day for weeks

past, and the roll was always the same. In fact, it was

dusty. Then to-day I decided to take it, and here you

are! He finished himself off yesterday, so far as I’m

concerned, with the business about the punt.”
“But do you know you’re a thief, Audrey?” breathed

Miss Ingate, extremely embarrassed, and for once somewhat

staggered by the vagaries of human nature.
“You seem to forget, Miss Ingate,” said Audrey

solemnly, “that Cousin Caroline left me a legacy of two

hundred pounds last year, and that I’ve never seen a

penny of it. Father absolutely declined to let me have

the tiniest bit of it. Well, I’ve taken half. He can keep

the other half for his trouble.”
Miss Ingate’s mouth stood open, and her eyes seemed

startled.
“But you can’t go to London alone. You wouldn’t

know what to do.”
“Yes, I should. I’ve arranged everything. I shall

wear my best clothes. When I arrive at Liverpool Street

I shall take a taxi. I’ve got three addresses of boarding-houses

out of the Daily Telegraph, and they’re all in

Bloomsbury, W.C. I shall have lessons in shorthand and

typewriting at Pitman’s School, and then I shall get a

situation. My name will be Vavasour.”
“But you’ll be caught.”
“I shan’t. I shall book to Ipswich first and begin

again from there. Girls like me aren’t so easy to catch

as all that.”
“You’re vehy cunning.”
“I get that from mother. She’s most frightfully cunning

with father.”
“Audrey,” said Miss Ingate with a strange grin, “I

don’t know how I can sit here and listen to you. You’ll

ruin me with your father, because if you go I’m sure I shall

never be able to keep from him that I knew all about it.”
“Then you shouldn’t have sworn,” retorted Audrey.

“But I’m glad you did swear, because I had to tell somebody,

and there was nobody but you.”
Miss Ingate might possibly have contrived to employ

some of that sagacity in which she took a secret pride

upon a very critical and urgent situation, had not Mrs.

Moze, with a white handkerchief wrapped round her forehead,

at that moment come into the room. Immediately

the study was full of neuralgia and eau-de-Cologne.
When Mrs. Moze and Miss Ingate at length recovered

from the tenderness of meeting each other after a separation

of ten days or more, Audrey had vanished like an illusion.

She was not afraid of her mother; and she could trust

Miss Ingate, though Miss Ingate and Mrs. Moze were

dangerously intimate; but she was too self-conscious to

remain in the presence of her fellow-creatures; and in spite

of her faith in Miss Ingate she thought of the spinster

as of a vase filled now with a fatal liquor which by any

accident might spill and spread ruin—so that she could

scarcely bear to look upon Miss Ingate.
At the back of the house a young Pomeranian dog,

which had recently solaced Miss Ingate in the loss of a

Pekingese done to death by a spinster’s too-nourishing

love, was prancing on his four springs round the chained

yard-dog, his friend and patron. In a series of marvellous

short bounds, he followed Audrey with yapping eagerness

down the slope of the garden; and the yard-dog, aware

that none but the omnipotent deity, Mr. Moze, sole source

of good and evil, had the right to loose him, turned

round once and laid himself flat and long on the ground,

sighing.
The garden, after developing into an orchard and

deteriorating into a scraggy plantation, ended in a low

wall that was at about the level of the sea-wall and

separated from it by a water-course and a strip of very

green meadow. Audrey glanced instinctively back at the

house to see if anybody was watching her.
Flank Hall, which for a hundred years had been called

“the new hall,” was a seemly Georgian residence, warm

in colour, with some quaint woodwork; and like most such

buildings in Essex, it made a very happy marriage with

the landscape. Its dormers and fine chimneys glowed amid

the dark bare trees, and they alone would have captivated

a Londoner possessing those precious attributes, fortunately

ever spreading among the enlightened middle-classes, a

motor-car, a cultured taste in architecture, and a desire

to enter the squirearchy. Audrey loathed the house. For

her it was the last depth of sordidness and the commonplace.

She could imagine positively nothing less romantic.

She thought of the ground floor on chill March mornings

with no fires anywhere save a red gleam in the dining-room,

and herself wandering about in it idle, at a loss

for a diversion, an ambition, an effort, a real task; and

she thought of the upper floor, a mainly unoccupied wilderness

of iron bedsteads and yellow chests of drawers and

chipped earthenware and islands of carpets, and her mother

plaintively and weariedly arguing with some servant over

a slop-pail in a corner. The images of the interior, indelibly

printed in her soul, desolated her.
Mozewater she loved, and every souvenir of it was exquisite—red

barges beating miraculously up the shallow

puddles to Moze Quay, equinoctial spring-tides when the

estuary was a tremendous ocean covered with foam and the

sea-wall felt the light lash of spray, thunderstorms in

autumn gathering over the yellow melancholy of deathlike

sunsets, wild birds crying across miles of uncovered mud at

early morning and duck-hunters crouching in punts behind

a waving screen of delicate grasses to wing them, and the

mysterious shapes of steamers and warships in the offing

beyond the Sand.... The sail of the receding yacht

gleamed now against the Sand, and its flashing broke her

heart; for it was the flashing of freedom. She thought of

the yachtsman; he was very courteous and deferential; a

mild creature; he had behaved to her as to a woman....

Oh! To be the petted and capricious wife of such a man,

to nod commands, to enslave with a smile, to want a thing

and instantly to have it, to be consulted and to decide, to

spend with large gestures, to be charitable, to be adored by

those whom you had saved from disaster, to increase

happiness wherever you went ... and to be free!....
The little dog jumped up at her because he was tired of

being ignored, and she caught him and kissed him again and

again passionately, and he wriggled with ecstasy and licked

her ears with all the love in him. And in kissing him she

kissed grave and affectionate husbands, she kissed the lovely

scenery of the Sound, and she kissed the magnificent ideal

of emancipation. But the dog had soon had enough of her

arms; he broke free, sprang, alighted, and rolled over, and

arose sniffing, with earth on his black muzzle....
He looked up at her inquiringly.... Strange, short-frocked

blue figure looking down at him! She had a bulging

forehead; her brown eyes were tunnelled underneath it.

But what living eyes, what ardent eyes, that blazed up and

sank like a fire! What delicate and exact mirrors of the

secret traffic between her soul and the soul of the world!

She had full cheeks, and a large mouth ripe red, inviting

and provocative. In the midst, an absurd small unprominent

nose that meant nothing! Her complexion was divine, surpassing

all similes. To caress that smooth downy cheek (if

you looked close you could see the infinitesimal down against

the light like an aura on the edge of the silhouette), even to

let the gaze dwell on it, what an enchantment!... She

considered herself piquant and comely, and she was not

deceived. She had long hands.
The wind from afar on her cheek reminded her

poignantly that she was a prisoner. She could not go to the

clustered village on the left, nor into the saltings on the

right, nor even on to the sea-wall where the new rushes and

grasses were showing. All the estuary was barred, and the

winding road that mounted the slope towards Colchester.

Her revolt against injustice was savage. Hatred of her

father surged up in her like glittering lava. She had long

since ceased to try to comprehend him. She despised herself

because she was unreasonably afraid of him, ridiculously

mute before him. She could not understand how anybody

could be friendly with him—for was he not notorious? Yet

everywhere he was greeted with respect and smiles, and he

would chat at length with all manner of people on a note of

mild and smooth cordiality. He and Miss Ingate would

enjoy together the most enormous talks. She was, however,

aware that Miss Ingate’s opinion of him was not very

different from her own. Each time she saw her father and

Miss Ingate in communion she would say in her heart to

Miss Ingate: “You are disloyal to me.” ...
Was it possible that she had confided to Miss Ingate her

fearful secret? The conversation appeared to her unreal

now. She went over her plan. In the afternoon her father

was always out, and to-morrow afternoon her mother would

be out too. She would have a few things in a light bag that

she could carry—her mother’s bag! She would put on her

best clothes and a veil from her mother’s wardrobe. She

would take the 4.5 p.m. train. The stationmaster would be

at his tea then. Only the booking-clerk and the porter

would see her, and neither would dare to make an observation.

She would ask for a return ticket to Ipswich; that

would allay suspicion, and at Ipswich she would book again.

She had cut out the addresses of the boarding-houses. She

would have to buy things in London. She knew of two

shops—Harrod’s and Shoolbred’s; she had seen their

catalogues. And the very next morning after arrival she

would go to Pitman’s School. She would change the first

of the £5 notes at the station and ask for plenty of silver.

She glanced at the unlimited wealth still crushed in her

hand, and then she carefully dropped the fortune down the

neck of her frock.... Stealing? She repulsed the idea

with violent disdain. What she had accomplished against

her father was not a crime, but a vengeance.... She

would never be found in London. It was impossible. Her

plan seemed to her to be perfect in each detail, except one.

She was not the right sort of girl to execute it. She was

very shy. She suspected that no other girl could really be

as shy as she was. She recalled dreadful rare moments with

her mother in strange drawing-rooms. Still, she would

execute the plan even if she died of fright. A force within

her would compel her to execute it. This force did not make

for happiness; on the contrary, it uncomfortably scared her;

but it was irresistible.
Something on the brow of the road from Colchester

attracted her attention. It was a handcart, pushed by a

labourer and by Police Inspector Keeble, whom she liked.

Following the handcart over the brow came a loose procession

of villagers, which included no children, because the

children were in school. Except on a Sunday Audrey had

never before seen a procession of villagers, and these

villagers must have been collected out of the fields, for the

procession was going in the direction of, and not away

from, the village. The handcart was covered with a

tarpaulin.... She knew what had happened; she knew

infallibly. Skirting the boundary of the grounds, she

reached the main entrance to Flank Hall thirty seconds

before the handcart. The little dog, delighted in a new

adventure, yapped ecstatically at her heels, and then

bounded onwards to meet the Inspector and the handcart.
“Run and tell yer mother, Miss Moze,” Inspector

Keeble called out in a carrying whisper. “There’s been

an accident. He ditched the car near Ardleigh cross-roads,

trying to avoid some fowls.”
Mr. Moze, hurrying too fast to meet the Bishop of

Colchester, had met a greater than the Bishop.
Audrey glanced an instant with a sick qualm at the outlines

of the shape beneath the tarpaulin, and ran.
In the dining-room, over the speck of fire, Mrs. Moze

and Miss Ingate were locked in a deep intimate gossip.
“Mother!” cried Audrey, and then sank like a sack.
“Why! The little thing’s fainted!” Miss Ingate exclaimed

in a voice suddenly hoarse.

CHAPTER III
THE LEGACY
Audrey and Miss Ingate were in the late Mathew Moze’s

study, fascinated—as much unconsciously as consciously—by

the thing which since its owner’s death had grown every

hour more mysterious and more formidable—the safe. It

was a fine afternoon. The secondary but still grandiose

enigma of the affair, Mr. Cowl, could be heard walking

methodically on the gravel in the garden. Mr. Cowl was

the secretary of the National Reformation Society.
Suddenly the irregular sound of crunching receded.
“He’s gone somewhere else,” said Audrey.
“I’m so relieved,” said Miss Ingate. “I hope he’s gone

a long way off.”
“Are you?” murmured Audrey, with an air of surprised

superiority.
But in secret Audrey felt just as relieved as Miss Ingate,

despite the fact that, her mother being prostrate, she was

the mistress of the situation, and could have ordered Mr.

Cowl to leave, with the certainty of being obeyed. She was

astonished at her illogical sensations, and she had been frequently

so astonished in the previous four days.
For example, she was free; she knew that she could

impose herself on her mother; never again would she be the

slave of an unreasoning tyrant; yet she was gloomy and

without hope. She had hated the unreasoning tyrant; yet

she felt very sorry for him because he was dead. And

though she felt very sorry for him, she detested hearing the

panegyrics upon him of the village, and particularly of those

persons with whom he had quarrelled; she actually stopped

Miss Ingate in the midst of an enumeration of his good

qualities—his charm, his smile, his courtesy, his integrity,

et cetera; she could not bear it. She thought that no child

had ever had such a strange attitude to a deceased parent as

hers to Mr. Moze. She had anticipated the inquest with an

awful dread; it proved to be a trifle, and a ridiculous trifle.

In the long weekly letter which she wrote to her adored

school-friend Ethel at Manningtree she had actually likened

the coroner to a pecking fowl! Was it possible that a

daughter could write in such a strain about the inquest on

her father’s body?
The funeral had seemed a function by itself, with some

guidance from the undertaker and still more from Mr. Cowl.

Villagers and district acquaintances had been many at the

ceremony, but relatives rare. Mr. Moze’s four younger

brothers were all in the Colonies; Mrs. Moze had apparently

no connections. Madame Piriac, daughter of Mr. Moze’s

first wife by that lady’s first husband, had telegraphed

sympathies from Paris. A cousin or so had come in person

from Woodbridge for the day.
It was from the demeanour of these cousins, grave men

twice her age or more, that Audrey had first divined her new

importance in the world. Their deference indicated that in

their opinion the future mistress of Flank Hall was not Mrs.

Moze, but Audrey. Audrey admitted that they were right.

Yet she took no pleasure in issuing commands. She spoke

firmly, but she said to herself: “There is no backbone to

this firmness, and I am a fraud.” She had always yearned

for responsibility, yet now that it was in her hand she

trembled, and she would have dropped it and run away from

it as from a bomb, had she not been too cowardly to show

her cowardice.
The instance of Aguilar, the head-gardener and mechanic,

well illustrated her pusillanimity. She loathed Aguilar; her

mother loathed him; the servants loathed him. He had said

at the inquest that the car was in perfect order, but that Mr.

Moze was too excitable to be a good driver. His evidence

was true, but the jury did not care for his manner. Nor did

the village. He had only two good qualities—honesty and

efficiency; and these by their rarity excited jealousy rather

than admiration. Audrey strongly desired to throw the

gardener-mechanic upon the world; it nauseated her to see

his disobliging face about the garden. But he remained

scathless, to refuse demanded vegetables, to annoy the

kitchen, to pronounce the motor-car utterly valueless, and to

complain of his own liver. Audrey had legs; she had a

tongue; she could articulate. Neither wish nor power was

lacking in her to give Aguilar the supreme experience of his

career. And yet she did not walk up to him and say:

“Aguilar, please take a week’s notice.” Why? The

question puzzled her and lowered her opinion of herself.
She was similarly absurd in the paramount matter of the

safe. The safe could not be opened. The village, having

been thrilled by four stirring days of the most precious and

rare fever, had suffered much after the funeral from a severe

reaction of dullness. It would have suffered much more had

the fact not escaped that the safe could not be opened. In

the deep depression of the day following the funeral the

village could still say to itself: “Romance and excitement

are not yet over, for the key of the Moze safe is lost, and the

will is in the safe!”
The village did not know that there were two keys to the

safe and that they were both lost. Nobody knew that except

Audrey and Miss Ingate and Mr. Cowl. The official key was

lost because Mr. Moze’s key-ring was lost. The theory was

that it had been jerked out of his pocket in the accident.

Persistent search for it had been unsuccessful. As for the

unofficial or duplicate key, Audrey could not remember

where she had put it after her burglary, the conclusion of

which had been disturbed by Miss Ingate. At one moment

she was quite sure that she had left the key in the safe, but

at another moment she was equally sure that she was holding

the key in her right hand (the bank-notes being in her

left) when Miss Ingate entered the room; at still another

moment she was almost convinced that before Miss Ingate’s

arrival she had run to the desk and slipped the key back

into its drawer. In any case the second key was irretrievable.

She discussed the dilemma very fully with Miss Ingate, who

had obligingly come to stay in the house. They examined

every aspect of the affair, except Audrey’s guiltiness of

theft, which both of them tacitly ignored. In the end they

decided that it might be wiser not to conceal Audrey’s

knowledge of the existence of a second key; and they told

Mr. Cowl, because he happened to be at hand. In so doing

they were ill-advised, because Mr. Cowl at once acted in a

characteristic and inconvenient fashion which they ought to

have foreseen.
On the day before the funeral Mr. Cowl had telegraphed

from some place in Devonshire that he should represent

the National Reformation Society at the funeral, and asked

for a bed, on the pretext that he could not get from

Devonshire to Moze in time for the funeral if he postponed

his departure until the next morning. The telegram was

quite costly. He arrived for dinner, a fat man about thirty-eight,

with chestnut hair, a low, alluring voice, and a small

handbag for luggage. Miss Ingate thought him very

interesting, and he was. He said little about the National

Reformation Society, but a great deal about the late Mr.

Moze, of whom he appeared to be an intimate friend;

presumably the friendship had developed at meetings of

the Society. After dinner he strolled nonchalantly to the

sideboard and opened a box of the deceased’s cigars, and

suggested that, as he was well acquainted with the brand,

having often enjoyed the hospitality of Mr. Moze’s cigar-case,

he should smoke a cigar now to the memory of the

departed. Miss Ingate then began to feel alarmed. He

smoked four cigars to the memory of the departed, and on

retiring ventured to take four more for consumption during

the night, as he seldom slept.
In the morning he went into the bathroom at eight

o’clock and remained there till noon, reading and smoking

in continually renewed hot water. He descended blandly,

begged Miss Moze not to trouble about his breakfast, and

gently assumed a certain control of the funeral. After the

funeral he announced that he should leave on the morrow;

but the mystery of the safe held him to the house. When

he heard of the existence of the second key he organised

and took command of a complete search of the study, and

in the course of the search he inspected every document

in the study. He said he knew that the deceased had

left a legacy to the Society, and he should not feel justified

in quitting Moze until the will was found.
Now in these circumstances Audrey ought certainly to

have telegraphed to her father’s solicitor at Chelmsford

at once. In the alternative she ought to have hired a

safe-opening expert or a burglar from Colchester. She

had accomplished neither of these downright things. With

absolute power, she had done nothing but postpone. She

wondered at herself, for up to her father’s death she had

been a great critic of absolute power.

The heavy policemanish step of Mr. Cowl was heard

on the landing.
“He’s coming down on us!” exclaimed Miss Ingate,

partly afraid, and partly ironic at her own fear. “I’m

sure he’s coming down on us. Audrey, I liked that man

at first, but now I tremble before him. And I’m sure his

moustache is dyed. Can’t you ask him to leave?”
“Is his moustache dyed, Winnie? Oh, what fun!”
Miss Ingate’s apprehension was justified. There was

a knock at the study door, discreet, insistent, menacing,

and it was Mr. Cowl’s knock. He entered, smiling

gravely and yet, as it were, teasingly. His easy bigness,

florid and sinister, made a disturbing contrast with the

artless and pure simplicity of Audrey in her new black robe,

and even with Miss Ingate’s pallid maturity, which, after all,

was passably innocent and ingenuous. Mr. Cowl resembled

a great beast good-humouredly lolloping into the cage in

which two rabbits had been placed for his diversion and

hunger.
Pulling a key from the pocket of his vast waistcoat,

he said in his quiet voice, so seductive and ominous:
“Is this the key of the safe?”
He offered it delicately to Audrey.
It was the key of the safe.
“Did they find it in the ditch?” Audrey demanded,

blushing, for she knew that the key had not been found

in the ditch; she knew by a certain indentation on it that it

was the duplicate key which she herself had mislaid.
“No,” said Mr. Cowl. “I found it myself, and not

in the ditch. I remembered you had said that you had

changed at the dressmaker’s in the village and had left

there an old frock.”
“Did I?” murmured Audrey, with a deeper blush.
Mr. Cowl nodded.
“I had the happy idea that you might have had the

key and left it in the pocket of the frock. So I trotted

down to the dressmaker’s and asked for the frock, in your

name, and lo! the result!”
He pointed to the key lying in Audrey’s long hand.
“But how should I have had the key, Mr. Cowl? Why

should I have had the key?” Audrey burst out like a

simpleton.
“That, Miss Moze,” said he, with a peculiar grin and

in an equally peculiar tone, “is a matter about which

obviously you are better informed than I am. Shall we

try the key?”
With a smooth undeniable gesture he took the key

again from Audrey, and bent his huge form to open the

safe. As he did so Miss Ingate made a sarcastic and yet

affrighted face at Audrey, and Audrey tried to send a signal

in reply, but failed, owing to imperfect self-control. However,

she managed to say to Mr. Cowl’s curved back:
“You couldn’t have found the key in the pocket of

my old frock, Mr. Cowl.”
“And why?” he inquired benevolently, raising and

turning his chestnut head. Even in that exciting instant

Audrey could debate within herself whether or not his

superb moustache was dyed.
“Because it has no pocket.”
“So I discovered,” said Mr. Cowl, after a little pause.

“I merely stated that I had the happy idea—for it proved

to be a happy idea—that you might have left the key in

the pocket. I discovered it, as a fact, in a slit of the

lining of the belt.... Conceivably you had slipped it in

there—in a hurry.” He put strange implications into the

last three words. “Yes, it is the authentic key,” he

concluded, as the door of the safe swung heavily and

silently open.
Audrey, for the first time, felt rather like a thief as

she beheld the familiar interior of the safe which a few

days earlier she had so successfully rifled. “Is it possible,”

she thought, “that I really took bank-notes out of that

safe, and that they are at this very moment in my bedroom

between the leaves of ‘Pictures of Palestine’?”
Mr. Cowl was cautiously fumbling among the serried

row of documents which, their edges towards the front,

filled the steel shelf above the drawers. Audrey had never

experienced any curiosity concerning the documents. Lucre

alone had interested the base creature. No documents

would have helped her to freedom. But now she thought

apprehensively: “My fate may be among those documents.”

She was quite prepared to learn that her father had done

something silly in his will.
“This resembles a testament,” said Mr. Cowl, smiling

to himself, and pulling out a foolscap scrip, folded and

endorsed. “Yes. Dated last year.”
He unfolded the document; a letter slipped from the

interior of it; he placed the letter on the small occasional

table next to the desk, and offered the will to Audrey with

precisely the same gesture as he had offered the key.
Audrey tried to decipher the will, and completely failed.
“Will you read it, Miss Ingate?” she muttered.
“I can’t! I can’t!” answered Miss Ingate in excitement.

“I’m sure I can’t. I never could read wills. They’re

so funny, somehow. And I haven’t got my spectacles.”

She flushed slightly.
“May I venture to tell you what it contains?” Mr.

Cowl suggested. “There can be no indiscretion on my

part, as all wills after probate are public property and

can be inspected by any Tom, Dick or Harry for a fee

of one shilling.”
He took the document and gazed at it intently, turning

over a page and turning back, for an extraordinarily

long time.
Audrey said to herself again and again, with exasperated

impatience: “He knows now, and I don’t know. He

knows now, and I don’t know. He knows now, and I

don’t know.”
At length Mr. Cowl spoke:
“It is a perfectly simple will. The testator leaves the

whole of his property to Mrs. Moze for life, and afterwards

to you, Miss Moze. There are only two legacies.

Ten pounds to James Aguilar, gardener. And the testator’s

shares in the Zacatecas Oil Development Corporation to the

National Reformation Society. I may say that the testator

had expressed to me his intention of leaving these shares

to the Society. We should have preferred money, free

of legacy duty, but the late Mr. Moze had a reason for

everything he did. I must now bid you good-bye, ladies,”

he went on strangely, with no pause. “Miss Moze, will

you convey my sympathetic respects to your mother and

my thanks for her most kind hospitality? My grateful

sympathies to yourself. Good-bye, Miss Ingate....

Er, Miss Ingate, why do you look at me in that

peculiar way?”
“Well, Mr. Cowl, you’re a very peculiar man. May

I ask whether you were born in this part of the

country?”
“At Clacton, Miss Ingate,” answered Mr. Cowl imperturbably.
“I knew it,” said Miss Ingate, and the corners of her

lips went sardonically down.
“Please don’t trouble to come downstairs,” said Mr.

Cowl. “My bag is packed. I have tipped the parlourmaid,

and there is just time to catch the train,”
He departed, leaving the two women speechless.
After a moment, Miss Ingate said dryly:
“He was so very peculiar I knew he must belong to

these parts.”
“How did he know I left my blue frock at Miss

Pannell’s?” cried Audrey. “I never told him.”
“He must have been eavesdropping!” cried Miss Ingate.

“He never found the key in your frock. He must have

found it here somewhere; I feel sure it must have dropped

by the safe, and I lay anything he had opened the safe

before and read the will before. I could tell from the

way he looked.”
“And why should he suppose that I’d the key?”

Audrey put in.
“Eavesdropping! I’m convinced that man knows too

much.” Audrey reddened once more. “I believe he thought

you’d be capable of burning the will. That’s why he made

you handle it in his presence and mine.”
“Well, Winnie,” said Audrey, “I think you might have

told him all that while he was here, instead of letting

him go off so triumphant.”
“I did begin to,” said Miss Ingate with a snigger.

“But you wouldn’t back me up, you little coward.”
“I shall never be a coward again!” Audrey said

violently.
They read the will together. They had no difficulty at

all in comprehending it now that they were alone.
“I do think it’s a horrid shame Aguilar should have

that ten pounds,” said Audrey. “But otherwise I don’t

care. You can’t guess how relieved I am, Winnie. I

imagined the most dreadful things. I don’t know what

I imagined. But now we shall have all the property and

everything, just as much as ever there was, and only me

and mother to spend it.” Audrey danced an embryonic

jig. “Won’t I keep mother in order! Winnie, I shall

make her go with me to Paris. I’ve always wanted to

know that Madame Piriac—she does write such funny

English in her letters.”
“What’s that you’re saying?” murmured Miss Ingate,

who had picked up the letter which Mr. Cowl had laid

on the small table.
“I say I shall make mother go to Paris with me.”
“You won’t,” said Miss Ingate. “Because she won’t

go. I know your mother better than you do.... Oh!

Audrey!”
Audrey saw Miss Ingate’s face turn scarlet from the

roots of her hair to her chin.
Miss Ingate had dropped the letter. Audrey snatched it.
“My dear Moze,” the letter ran. “I send you herewith

a report of the meeting of the Great Mexican Oil Company at

New York. You will see that they duly authorised the contract

by which the Zacatecas Oil Corporation transfers our

property to them in exchange for shares at the rate of four

Great Mexican shares for one Zacatecas share. As each of

the Development Syndicate shares represents ten of the

Corporation shares, and as on my recommendation you put

£4,500 into the Syndicate, you will therefore own 180,000

Great Mexican shares. They are at present above par.

Mark my words, they will be worth from seven to ten dollars

apiece in a year’s time. I think you now owe me a good

turn, eh?”
The letter was signed with a name unknown to either

of them, and it was dated from Coleman Street, E.C.

CHAPTER IV
MR. FOULGER
Half an hour later the woman and the girl, still in the study

and severely damaged by the culminating events of Mr.

Cowl’s visit, were almost prostrated by the entirely unexpected

announcement of the arrival of Mr. Foulger. Mr.

Foulger was the late Mr. Moze’s solicitor from Chelmsford.

Audrey’s first thought was: “Has heaven telegraphed to

him on my behalf?” But her next was that all the solicitors

in the world would now be useless in the horrible calamity

that had befallen.
It is to be noted that Audrey was no worse off than

before the discovery of the astounding value of the

Zacatecas shares. The Moze property, inherited through

generations and consisting mainly in farms and tithe-rents,

was not in the slightest degree impaired. On the contrary,

the steady progress of agriculture in Essex indicated that its

yield must improve with years. Nevertheless Audrey felt as

though she and her mother were ruined, and as though the

National Reformation Society had been guilty of a fearful

crime against a widow and an orphan. The lovely vision of

immeasurable wealth had flashed and scintillated for a month

in front of her dazzled eyes—and then blackness, nothingness,

the dark void! She knew that she would never be

happy again.
And she thought, scornfully, “How could father

have been so preoccupied and so gloomy, with all those

riches?” She could not conceive anybody as rich as her

father secretly was not being day and night in a condition

of pure delight at the whole spectacle of existence.

Her opinion of Mathew Moze fell lower than ever, and

fell finally.
The parlourmaid, in a negligence of attire indicating that

no man was left alive in the house, waited at the door of the

study to learn whether or not Miss Moze was in.
“You’ll have to see him,” said Miss Ingate firmly.

“It’ll be all right. I’ve known him all my life. He’s a very

nice man.”
After the parlourmaid had gone, and while Audrey was

upbraiding her for not confessing earlier her acquaintance

with Mr. Foulger, Miss Ingate added:
“Only his wife has a wooden leg.”
Then Mr. Foulger entered. He was a shortish man of

about fifty, with a paunch, but not otherwise fat; dressed

like a sportsman. He trod very lightly. The expression on

his ruddy face was amiable but extremely alert, hardening at

intervals into decision or caution. He saw before him a

nervous, frowning girl in inelegant black, and Miss Ingate

with a curious look in her eyes and a sardonic and timid

twitching of her lips. For an instant he was discountenanced;

but he at once recovered, accomplishing a

bright salute.
“Here you are at last, Mr. Foulger!” Miss Ingate

responded. “But you’re too late.”
These mysterious words, and the speechlessness of

Audrey, upset him again.
“I was away in Somersetshire for a little fishing,” he

said, after he had deplored the death of Mr. Moze, the illness

of Mrs. Moze, and the bereavement of Miss Moze, and had

congratulated Miss Moze on the protective friendship of his

old friend, Miss Ingate. “I was away for a little fishing,

and I only heard the sad news when I got back home at

noon to-day. I came over at once.” He cleared his throat

and looked first at Audrey and then at Miss Ingate. He felt

that he ought to be addressing Audrey, but somehow he

could not help addressing Miss Ingate instead. His grey

legs were spread abroad as he sat very erect on a chair,

and between them his dependent paunch found a comfortable

space for itself.
“You must have been getting anxious about the will.

I have brought it with me,” he said. He drew a white

document from the breast-pocket of his cutaway coat, and

he perched a pair of eyeglasses carelessly on his nose. “It

was executed before your birth, Miss Moze. But a will

keeps like wine. The whole of the property of every

description is left to Mrs. Moze, and she is sole executrix. If

she should predecease the testator, then everything is left

to his child or children. Not perhaps a very businesslike

will—a will likely to lead to unforeseen complications, but the

sort of will that a man in the first flush of marriage often

does make, and there is no stopping him. Your father had

almost every quality, but he was not businesslike—if I may

say so with respect. However, I confess that for the present

I see no difficulties. Of course the death duties will

have to be paid, but your father always kept a considerable

amount of money at call. When I say ‘considerable,’ I

mean several thousands. That was a point on which he and

I had many discussions.”
Mr. Foulger glanced around with satisfaction. Already

the prospect of legal business and costs had brought about

a change in his official demeanour of an adviser truly

bereaved by the death of a client. He saw the young girl,

gazing fiercely at the carpet, suddenly begin to weep. This

phenomenon, to which he was not unaccustomed, did not by

itself disturb him; but the face of Miss Ingate gave him

strange apprehensions, which reached a climax when Miss

Ingate, obviously not at all at ease, muttered:
“There is a later will, Mr. Foulger. It was made last

year.”
“I see,” he breathed, scarcely above a whisper.
He thought he did see. He thought he understood why

he had been kept waiting, why Mrs. Moze pretended to be

ill, why the girl had frowned, why the naively calm Miss

Ingate was in such a state of nerves. The explanation was

that he was not wanted. The explanation was that Mr.

Moze had changed his solicitor. His face hardened, for he

and his uncle between them had “acted” for the Moze

family for over seventy years.
He rose from the chair.
“Then I need not trouble you any longer,” he said in a

firm tone, and turned with real dignity to leave.
He was exceedingly astonished when with one swift

movement Audrey rose, and flashed like a missile to the door,

and stood with her back to it. The fact was that Audrey

had just remembered her vow never again to be afraid of

anybody. When Miss Ingate with extraordinary agility also

jumped up and approached him, he apprehended, recalling

rumours of Miss Ingate’s advanced feminism, that the fate

of an anti-suffragette Cabinet Minister might be awaiting

him, and he prepared his defence.
“You mustn’t go,” said Miss Ingate.
“You are my solicitor, whatever mother may say, and

you mustn’t go,” added Audrey in a soft voice.
The man was entranced. It occurred to him that

he would have a tale to tell and to re-tell at his club

for years, about “a certain fair client who shall be

nameless.”
The next minute he had heard a somewhat romantic, if

not hysterical, version of the facts of the case, and he was

perusing the original documents. By chance he read first

the letter about the Zacatecas shares. That Mathew Moze

had made a will without his aid was a shock; that Mathew

Moze had invested money without his advice was another

shock quite as severe. But he knew the status of the Great

Mexican Oil Company, and his countenance lighted as he

realised the rich immensity of the business of proving the

will and devolving the estate; his costs would run to the most

agreeable figures. As soon as he glanced at the testament

which Mr. Cowl had found, he muttered, with satisfaction

and disdain:
“H’m! He made this himself.”
And he gazed at it compassionately, as a cabinetmaker

might gaze at a piece of amateur fretwork.
Standing, he read it slowly and with extreme care. And

when he had finished he casually remarked, in the classic

legal phrase:
“It isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.”
Then he sat down again, and his neat paunch resumed

its niche between his legs. He knew that he had made a

tremendous effect.
“But—but——” Miss Ingate began.
“Not worth the paper it’s written on,” he repeated.

“There is only one witness, and there ought to be two, and

even the one witness is a bad one—Aguilar, because he

profits under the will. He would have to give up his legacy

before his attestation could count, and even then it would be

no good alone. Mr. Moze has not even expressly revoked

the old will. If there hadn’t been a previous will, and if

Aguilar was a thoroughly reliable man, and if the family had

wished to uphold the new will, I dare say the Court might

have pronounced for it. But under the circumstances it

hasn’t the ghost of a chance.”
“But won’t the National Reformation Society make

trouble?” demanded Miss Ingate faintly.
“Let ’em try!” said Mr. Foulger, who wished that the

National Reformation Society would indeed try.
Even as he articulated the words, he was aware of

Audrey coming towards him from the direction of the door;

he was aware of her black frock and of her white face, with

its bulging forehead and its deliciously insignificant nose.

She held out her hand.
“You are a dear!” she whispered.
Her lips seemed to aim uncertainly for his face. Did

they just touch, with exquisite contact, his bristly chin, or

was it a divine illusion? ... She blushed in a very marked

manner. He blinked, and his happy blinking seemed to say:

“Only wills drawn by me are genuine.... Didn’t I tell

you Mr. Moze was not a man of business?”
Audrey ran to Miss Ingate.
Mr. Foulger, suddenly ashamed, and determined to be a

lawyer, said sharply:
“Has Mrs. Moze made a will?”
“Mother made a will? Oh no!”
“Then she should make one at once, in your favour, of

course. No time should be lost.”
“But Mrs. Moze is ill in bed,” protested Miss Ingate.
“All the more reason why she should make a will. It

may save endless trouble. And it is her duty. I shall

suggest that I be the executor and trustee, of course with

the usual power to charge costs.” His face was hard again.

“You will thank me later on, Miss Moze,” he added.
“Do you mean now?“ shrilled Miss Ingate.
“I do,” said he. “If you will give me some paper, we

might go to her at once. You can be one of the witnesses.

I could be a witness, but as I am to act under the will for a

consideration somebody else would be preferable.”
“I should suggest Aguilar,” answered Miss Ingate, the

corners of her lips dropping.
Miss Ingate went first, to prepare Mrs. Moze.
When Audrey was alone in the study—she had not even

offered to accompany her elders to the bedroom—she made a

long sound: “Ooo!” Then she gave a leap and stood still,

staring out of the window at the estuary. She tried to force

her mood to the colour of her dress, but the sense of propriety

was insufficient for the task. The magnificence of all

the world was unfolding itself to her soul. Events had

hitherto so dizzyingly beaten down upon her head that she

had scarcely been conscious of feeling. Now she luxuriously

felt. “I am at last born,” she thought. “Miracles have

happened.... It’s incredible.... I can do what I like

with mother.... But if I don’t take care I shall die of

relief this very moment!”

CHAPTER V
THE DEAD HAND
Audrey was wakened up that night, just after she had

gone to sleep, by a touch on the cheek. Her mother,

palely indistinct in the darkness, was standing by the bedside.

She wore a white wrap over her night attire, and the

customary white bandage from which emanated a faint odour

of eau-de-Cologne, was around her forehead.
“Audrey, darling, I must speak to you.”
Instantly Audrey became the wise directress of her poor

foolish mother’s existence.
“Mother,” she said, with firm kindness, “please do go

back to bed at once. This sort of thing is simply frightful

for your neuralgia. I’ll come to you in one moment.”
And Mrs. Moze meekly obeyed; she had gone even

before Audrey had had time to light her candle. Audrey

was very content in thus being able to control her mother

and order everything for the best. She guessed that the

old lady had got some idea into her head about the

property, or about her own will, or about the solicitor, or

about a tombstone, and that it was worrying her. She

and Miss Ingate (who had now returned home) had had

a very extensive palaver, in low voices that never ceased,

after the triumphant departure of Mr. Foulger. Audrey

had cautiously protested; she was afraid her mother would

be fatigued, and she saw no reason why her mother should

be acquainted with all the details of a complex matter;

but the gossiping habit of a quarter of a century was too

powerful for Audrey.
In the large parental bedroom the only light was Audrey’s

candle. Mrs. Moze was lying on the right half of the

great bed, where she had always lain. She might have

lain luxuriously in the middle, with vast spaces at either

hand, but again habit was too powerful.
The girl, all in white, held the candle higher, and the

shadows everywhere shrunk in unison. Mrs. Moze blinked.
“Put the candle on the night-table,” said Mrs. Moze

curtly.
Audrey did so. The bedroom, for her, was full of

the souvenirs of parental authority. Her first recollections

were those of awe in regard to the bedroom. And when

she thought that on that bed she had been born, she had

a very queer sensation.
“I’ve decided,” said Mrs. Moze, lying on her back,

and looking up at the ceiling, “I’ve decided that your

father’s wishes must be obeyed.”
“What about, mother?”
“About those shares going to the National Reformation

Society. He meant them to go, and they must go to the

Society. I’ve thought it well over and I’ve quite decided.

I didn’t tell Miss Ingate, as it doesn’t concern her. But

I felt I must tell you at once.”
“Mother!” cried Audrey. “Have you taken leave of

your senses?” She shivered; the room was very cold,

and as she shivered her image in the mirror of the wardrobe

shivered, and also her shadow that climbed up the

wall and bent at right-angles at the cornice till it reached

the middle of the ceiling.
Mrs. Moze replied obstinately:
“I’ve not taken leave of my senses, and I’ll thank

you to remember that I’m your mother. I have always

carried out your father’s wishes, and at my time of life

I can’t alter. Your father was a very wise man. We

shall be as well off as we always were. Better, because

I can save, and I shall save. We have no complaint to

make; I should have no excuse for disobeying your father.

Everything is mine to do as I wish with it, and I shall

give the shares to the Society. What the shares are

worth can’t affect my duty. Besides, perhaps they aren’t

worth anything. I always understood that things like that

were always jumping up and down, and generally worthless

in the end.... That’s all I wanted to tell you.”
Why did Audrey seize the candle and walk straight out

of the bedroom, leaving darkness behind her? Was it

because the acuteness of her feelings drove her out, or was

it because she knew instinctively that her mother’s decision

would prove to be immovable? Perhaps both.
She dropped back into her own bed with a soundless

sigh of exhaustion. She did not blow out the candle, but

lay staring at it. Her dream was annihilated. She foresaw

an interminable, weary and futile future in and about

Moze, and her mother always indisposed, always fretful,

and curiously obstinate in weakness. But Audrey, despite

her tragic disillusion, was less desolated than made solemn.

In the most disturbing way she knew herself to be the

daughter of her father and her mother; and she comprehended

that her destiny could not be broken off suddenly

from theirs. She was touched because her mother deemed

her father a very wise man, whereas she, Audrey, knew

that he was nothing of the sort. She felt sorry for both

of them. She pitied her father, and she was a mother

to her mother. Their relations together, and the mystic

posthumous spell of her father over her mother, impressed

her profoundly.... And she was proud of herself for

having demonstrated her courage by preventing the solicitor

from running away, and extraordinarily ashamed of her

sentimental and brazen behaviour to the solicitor afterwards.

These various thoughts mitigated her despair as

she gazed at the sinking candle. Nevertheless her dream

was annihilated.

CHAPTER VI
THE YOUNG WIDOW
It was early October. Audrey stood at the garden door

of Flank Hall.
The estuary, in all the colours of unsettled, mild,

bright weather, lay at her feet beneath a high arch of

changing blue and white. The capricious wind moved in

her hair, moved in the rich grasses of the sea-wall, bent

at a curtseying angle the red-sailed barges, put caps on

the waves in the middle distance, and drew out into long

horizontal scarves the smoke of faint steamers in the

offing.
Audrey was dressed in black, but her raiment had

obviously not been fashioned in the village, nor even at

Colchester, nor yet at Ipswich, that great and stylish city.

She looked older; she certainly had acquired something

of an air of knowledge, assurance, domination, sauciness

and challenge, which qualities were all partly illustrated

in her large, audacious hat. The spirit which the late

Mr. Moze had so successfully suppressed was at length

coming to the surface for all beholders to see, and the

process of evolution begun at the moment when Audrey

had bounced up and prevented an authoritative solicitor

from leaving the study was already advanced. Nevertheless,

at frequent intervals Audrey’s eyes changed, and she seemed

for an instant to be a very naive, very ingenuous and

wistful little thing—and this though she had reached the

age of twenty. Perhaps she was feeling sorry for the

girl she used to be.
And no doubt she was also thinking of her mother,

who had died within eight hours of their nocturnal interview.

The death of Mrs. Moze surprised everyone, except possibly

Mrs. Moze. As an unsuspected result of the operation

upon her, an embolism had been wandering in her veins;

it reached the brain, and she expired, to the great loss of

the National Reformation Society. Such was the brief

and simple history. When Audrey stood by the body, she

had felt that if it could have saved her mother she would

have enriched the National Reformation Society with all she

possessed.
Gradually the sense of freedom had grown paramount

in her, and she had undertaken the enterprise of completely

subduing Mr. Foulger to her own ends.
The back hall was carpetless and pictureless, and the

furniture in it was draped in grey-white. Every room in

the abode was in the same state, and, since all the

windows were shuttered, every room lay moribund in a

ghostly twilight. Only the clocks remained alive, probably

thinking themselves immortal. The breakfast things were

washed up and stored away. The last two servants had

already gone. Behind Audrey, forming a hilly background,

were trunks and boxes, a large bunch of flowers encased

in paper, and a case of umbrellas and parasols; the whole

strikingly new, and every single item except the flowers

labelled “Paris via Charing Cross and Calais.”
Audrey opened her black Russian satchel, and the

purse within it. Therein were a little compartment full of

English gold, another full of French gold, another full

of multicoloured French bank-notes; and loose in the satchel

was a blue book of credit-notes, each for five hundred

francs, or twenty pounds—a thick book! And she would

not have minded much if she had lost the whole satchel

—it would be so easy to replace the satchel with all its

contents.
Then a small brougham came very deliberately up the

drive. It was the vehicle in which Miss Ingate went

her ways; in accordance with Miss Ingate’s immemorial

command, it travelled at a walking pace up all the hills

to save the horse, and at a walking pace down all hills

lest the horse should stumble and Miss Ingate be destroyed.

It was now followed by a luggage-cart on which was a

large trunk.
At the same moment Aguilar, the gardener, appeared

from somewhere—he who had been robbed of a legacy

of ten pounds, but who by his ruthless and incontestable

integrity had secured the job of caretaker of Flank

Hall.
The drivers touched their hats to Audrey and jumped

down, and Miss Ingate, with a blue veil tied like a handkerchief

round her bonnet and chin—sign that she was a

traveller—emerged from the brougham, sardonically smiling

at her own and everybody’s expense, and too excited to

be able to give greetings. The three men started to move

the trunks, and the two women whispered together in

the back-hall.
“Audrey,” demanded Miss Ingate, with a start, “what

are those rings on your finger?”
Audrey replied:
“One’s a wedding ring and the other’s a mourning ring.

I bought them yesterday at Colchester.... Hsh!” She

stilled further exclamations from Miss Ingate until the

men were out of the hall.
“Look here! Quick!” she whispered, hastily unlocking

a large hat-case that was left. And Miss Ingate looked

and saw a block toque, entirely unsuitable for a young

girl, and a widow’s veil.
“I look bewitching in them,” said Audrey, relocking

the case.
“But, my child, what does it mean?”
“It means that I’m not silly enough to go to Paris

as a girl. I’ve had more than enough of being a girl.

I’m determined to arrive in Paris as a young widow. It

will be much better in every way, and far easier for you.

In fact, you’ll have no chaperoning to do at all. I shall

be the chaperon. Now don’t say you won’t go, because

you will.”
“You ought to have told me before.”
“No, I oughtn’t. Nothing could have been more

foolish.”
“But who are you the widow of?”
“Hurrah!” cried Audrey. “You are a sport, Winnie!

I’ll tell you all the interesting details in the train.”
In another minute Aguilar, gloomy and unbending, had

received the keys of Flank Hall, and the procession crunched

down the drive on its way to the station.

CHAPTER VII
THE CIGARETTE GIRL
Audrey did not deem that she had begun truly to live

until the next morning, when they left London, after having

passed a night in the Charing Cross Hotel. During several

visits to London in the course of the summer Audrey had

learnt something about the valuelessness of money in a

metropolis chiefly inhabited by people who were positively

embarrassed by their riches. She knew, for example, that

money being very plentiful and stylish hats very rare, large

quantities of money had to be given for infinitesimal quantities

of hats. The big and glittering shops were full of

people whose pockets bulged with money which they were

obviously anxious to part with in order to obtain goods,

while the proud shop-assistants, secure in the knowledge

that money was naught and goods were everything, did their

utmost, by hauteur and steely negatives, to render any

transaction possible. It was the result of a mysterious

“Law of Exchange.” She was aware of this. She had

lost her childhood’s naive illusions about the sovereignty

of money.
Nevertheless she received one or two shocks on the

journey, which was planned upon the most luxurious scale

that the imagination of Messrs. Thomas Cook & Son could

conceive. There was four pounds and ninepence to pay for

excess luggage at Charing Cross. Half a year earlier four

pounds would have bought all the luggage she could have

got together. She very nearly said to the clerk at the window:

“Don’t you mean shillings?” But in spite of nervousness,

blushings, and all manner of sensitive reactions to new

experiences, her natural sang-froid and instinctive knowledge

of the world saved her from such a terrible lapse, and she

put down a bank-note without the slightest hint that she was

wondering whether it would not be more advantageous to

throw the luggage away.
The boat was crowded, and the sea and wind full of

menace. Fighting their way along the deck after laden

porters, Audrey and Miss Ingate simultaneously espied the

private cabin list hung in a conspicuous spot. They perused

it as eagerly as if it had been the account of a cause célèbre.

Among the list were two English lords, an Honourable Mrs.,

a baroness with a Hungarian name, several Teutonic names,

and Mrs. Moncreiff.
Audrey blushed deeply at the sign of Mrs. Moncreiff, for

she was Mrs. Moncreiff. Behind the veil, and with the touch

of white in her toque, she might have been any age up to

twenty-eight or so. It would have been impossible to say

that she was a young girl, that she was not versed in the

world, that she had not the whole catechism of men at her

finger-ends. All who glanced at her glanced again—with

sympathy and curiosity; and the second glance pricked

Audrey’s conscience, making her feel like a thief. But her

moods were capricious. At one moment she was a thief,

a clumsy fraud, an ignorant ninny, and a suitable prey for

the secret police; and at the next she was very clever,

self-confident, equal to the situation, and enjoying the

situation more than she had ever enjoyed anything, and

determined to prolong the situation indefinitely.
The cabin was very spacious, yet not more so than was

proper, considering that the rent of it came to about sixpence

a minute. There was room, even after all the packages

were stowed, for both of them to lie down. But instead

of lying down they eagerly inspected the little abode. They

found a lavatory basin with hot and cold water taps, but no

hot water and no cold water, no soap and no towels. And

they found a crystal water-bottle, but it was empty. Then

a steward came and asked them if they wanted anything,

and because they were miserable poltroons they smiled and

said “No.” They were secretly convinced that all the other

private cabins, inhabited by titled persons and by financiers,

were superior to their cabin, and that the captain of the

steamer had fobbed them off with an imitation of a real cabin.
Then it was that Miss Ingate, who since Charing Cross

had been a little excited by a glimpsed newspaper contents-bill

indicating suffragette riots that morning, perceived,

through the open door of the cabin, a most beautiful and

most elegant girl, attired impeccably in that ritualistic garb

of travel which the truly cosmopolitan wear on combined

rail-and-ocean journeys and on no other occasions. It was

at once apparent that the celestial creature had put on that

special hat, that special veil, that special cloak, and those

special gloves because she was deeply aware of what was

correct, and that she would not put them on again until

destiny took her again across the sea, and that if destiny

never did take her again across the sea never again would

she show herself in the vestments, whose correctness was

only equalled by their expensiveness.
The young woman, however, took no thought of her impressive

clothes. She was existing upon quite another plane.

Miss Ingate, preoccupied by the wrongs and perils of her

sex, and momentarily softened out of her sardonic irony,

suspected that they might be in the presence of a victim of

oppression or neglect. The victim lay Half-prone upon the

hard wooden seat against the ship’s rail. Her dark eyes

opened piteously at times, and her exquisite profile, surmounted

by the priceless hat all askew, made a silhouette

now against the sea and now against the distant white cliffs

of Albion, according to the fearful heaving of the ship.

Spray occasionally dashed over her. She heeded it not. A

few feet farther off she would have been sheltered by a

weather-awning, but, clinging fiercely to the rail, she would

not move.
Then a sharp squall of rain broke, but she entirely ignored

the rain.
The next moment Miss Ingate and Audrey, rushing forth,

had gently seized her and drawn her into their cabin. They

might have succoured other martyrs to the modern passion

for moving about, for there were many; but they chose this

particular martyr because she was so wondrously dressed,

and also perhaps a little because she was so young. As she

lay on the cabin sofa she looked still younger; she looked a

child. Yet when Miss Ingate removed her gloves in order

to rub those chill, fragile, and miraculously manicured hands,

a wedding ring was revealed. The wedding ring rendered

her intensely romantic in the eyes of Audrey and Miss Ingate,

who both thought, in private:
“She must be the wife of one of those lords!”
Every detail of her raiment, as she was put at her ease,

showed her to be clothed in precisely the manner which

Audrey and Miss Ingate thought peeresses always were

clothed. Hence, being English, they mingled respect with

their solacing pity. Nevertheless, their respect was tempered

by a peculiar pride, for both of them, in taking lemonade

on the Pullman, had taken therewith a certain preventive

or remedy which made them loftily indifferent to the heaving

of ships and the eccentricities of the sea. The specific had

done all that was claimed for it—which was a great deal—so

much so that they felt themselves superwomen among

a cargo of flaccid and feeble sub-females. And they grew

charmingly conceited.
“Am I in my cabin?” murmured the martyr, about a

quarter of an hour after Miss Ingate, having obtained soda

water, had administered to her a dose of the miraculous

specific.
Her delicious cheeks were now a delicate crimson. But

they had been of a delicate crimson throughout.
“No,” said Audrey. “You’re in ours. Which is

yours?”
“It’s on the other side of the ship, then. I came out for

a little air. But I couldn’t get back. I’d just as lief have

died as shift from that seat out there by the railings.”
Something in the accent, something in those fine English

words “lief” and “shift,” destroyed in the minds of Audrey

and Miss Ingate the agreeable notion that they had a peeress

on their hands.
“Is your husband on board?” asked Audrey.
“He just is,” was the answer. “He’s in our cabin.”
“Shall I fetch him?” Miss Ingate suggested. The

corners of her lips had begun to fall once more.
“Will you?” said the young woman. “It’s Lord Southminster.

I’m Lady Southminster.”
The two saviours were thrilled. Each felt that she had

misinterpreted the accent, and that probably peeresses did

habitually use such words as “lief” and “shift.” The

corners of Miss Ingate’s lips rose to their proper position.
“I’ll look for the number on the cabin list,” said she

hastily, and went forth with trembling to summon the peer.
As Audrey, alone in the cabin with Lady Southminster,

bent curiously over the prostrate form, Lady Southminster

exclaimed with an air of childlike admiration:
“You’re real ladies, you are!”
And Audrey felt old and experienced. She decided that

Lady Southminster could not be more than seventeen, and it

seemed to be about half a century since Audrey was seventeen.
“He can’t come,” announced Miss Ingate breathlessly,

returning to the cabin, and supporting herself against the

door as the solid teak sank under her feet. “Oh yes! He’s

there all right. It was Number 12. I’ve seen him. I told

him, but I don’t think he heard me—to understand, that

is. If you ask me, he couldn’t come if forty wives sent

for him.”
“Oh, couldn’t he!” observed Lady Southminster, sitting

up. “Couldn’t he!”
When the boat was within ten minutes of France, the

remedy had had such an effect upon her that she could walk

about. Accompanied by Audrey she managed to work her

way round the cabin-deck to No. 12. It was empty, save

for hand-luggage! The two girls searched, as well as they

could, the whole crowded ship for Lord Southminster, and

found him not. Lady Southminster neither fainted nor wept.

She merely said:
“Oh! All right! If that’s it....!”
Hand-luggage was being collected. But Lady Southminster

would not collect hers, nor allow it to be collected.

She agreed with Miss Ingate and Audrey that her husband

must ultimately reappear either on the quay or in the train.

While they were all standing huddled together in the throng

waiting for the gangway to put ashore, she said in a low

casual tone, à propos of nothing:
“I only married him the day before yesterday. I don’t

know whether you know, but I used to make cigarettes in

Constantinopoulos’s window in Piccadilly. I don’t see why

I should be ashamed of it, d’you?”
“Certainly not,” said Miss Ingate. “But it is rather

romantic, isn’t it, Audrey?”
Despite the terrific interest of the adventure of the

cigarette girl, disappointment began immediately after landing.

This France, of which Audrey had heard so much and

dreamed so much, was a very ramshackle and untidy and

one-horse affair. The custom-house was rather like a battlefield

without any rules of warfare; the scene in the refreshment-room

was rather like a sack after a battle; the station

was a desert with odd files of people here and there; the

platforms were ridiculous, and you wanted a pair of steps to

get up into the train. Whatever romance there might be in

France had been brought by Audrey in her secret heart and

by Lady Southminster.
Audrey had come to France, and she was going to Paris,

solely because of a vision which had been created in her by

the letters and by the photographs of Madame Piriac.

Although Madame Piriac and she had absolutely no tie of

blood, Madame Piriac being the daughter by a first husband

of the French widow who became the first Mrs. Moze—and

speedily died, Audrey persisted privately in regarding

Madame Piriac as a kind of elder sister. She felt a very

considerable esteem for Madame Piriac, upon whom she had

never set eyes, and Madame Piriac had certainly given her

the impression that France was to England what paradise is

to purgatory. Further, Audrey had fallen in love with

Madame Piriac’s portraits, whose elegance was superb. And

yet, too, Audrey was jealous of Madame Piriac, and

especially so since the attainment of freedom and wealth.

Madame Piriac had most warmly invited her, after the death

of Mrs. Moze, to pay a long visit to Paris as a guest in her

home. Audrey had declined—from jealousy. She would not

go to Madame Piriac’s as a raw girl, overdone with money,

who could only speak one language and who knew nothing

at all of this our planet. She would go, if she went, as a

young woman of the world who could hold her own in any

drawing-room, be it Madame Piriac’s or another. Hence

Miss Ingate had obtained the address of a Paris boarding-house,

and one or two preliminary introductions from political

friends in London.
Well, France was not equal to its reputation; and Miss

Ingate’s sardonic smile seemed to be saying: “So this is

your France!”
However, the excitement of escorting the youngest

English peeress to Paris sufficed for Audrey, even if it did

not suffice for Miss Ingate with her middle-aged apprehensions.

They knew that Lady Southminster was the

youngest English peeress because she had told them so. At

the very moment when they were dispatching a telegram for

her to an address in London, she had popped out the

remark: “Do you know I’m the youngest peeress in England?”

And truth shone in her candid and simple smile.

They had not found the peer, neither on the ship, nor on the

quay, nor in the station. And the peeress would not wait.

She was indeed obviously frightened at the idea of remaining

in Calais alone, even till the next express. She said that her

husband’s “man” would meet the train in Paris. She ate

plenteously with Audrey and Miss Ingate in the refreshment-room,

and she would not leave them nor allow them to leave

her. The easiest course was to let her have her way, and

she had it.
By dint of Miss Ingate’s unscrupulous tricks with small

baggage they contrived to keep a whole compartment to

themselves. As soon as the train started the peeress began

to cry. Then, wiping her heavenly silly eyes, and upbraiding

herself, she related to her protectresses the glory of a new

manicure set. Unfortunately she could not show them the

set, as it had been left in the cabin. She was actually in

possession of nothing portable except her clothes, some

English magazines bought at Calais, and a handbag which

contained much money and many bonbons.
“He’s done it on purpose,” she said to Audrey as soon

as Miss Ingate went off to take tea in the tea-car. “I’m

sure he’s done it on purpose. He’s hidden himself, and he’ll

turn up when he thinks he’s beaten me. D’you know why

I wouldn’t bring that luggage away out of the cabin?

Because we had a quarrel about it, at the station, and he

said things to me. In fact we weren’t speaking. And we

weren’t speaking last night either. The radiator of his—our—car

leaked, and we had to come home from the Coliseum

in a motor-bus. He couldn’t get a taxi. It wasn’t his fault,

but a friend of mine told me the day before I was married

that a lady always ought to be angry when her husband

can’t get a taxi after the theatre—she says it does ’em good.

So first I told him he mustn’t leave me to look for one.

Then I said I’d wait where I was, and then I said we’d walk

on, and then I said we must take a motor-bus. It was that

that finished him. He said: ‘Did I expect him to invent a

taxi when there wasn’t one?’ And he swore. So of course

I sulked. You must, you know. And my shoes were too

thin and I felt chilly. But only a fortnight before I was

making cigarettes in the window of Constantinopoulos’s.

Funny, isn’t it? Otherwise he’s behaved splendid. Still,

what I do say is a man’s no right to be ill when he’s taking

you to Paris on your honeymoon. I knew he was going to

be ill when I left him in the cabin, but he stuck me out he

wasn’t. A man that’s so bad he can’t come to his wife when

she’s bad isn’t a man—that’s what I say. Don’t you think

so? You know all about that sort of thing, I lay.”
Audrey said briefly that she did think so, glad that the

peeress’s intense and excusable interest in herself kept her

from being curious about others.
“Marriage ain’t all chocolate-creams,” said the peeress

after a pause. “Have one?” And she opened her bag very

hospitably.
Then she turned to her magazines. And no sooner had

she glanced at the cover of the second one than she gave

a squeal, and, fetching deep breaths, passed the periodical to

Audrey. At the top of the cover was printed in large letters

the title of a story by a famous author of short tales. It

ran:
“MAN OVERBOARD.”
Henceforward a suspicion that had lain concealed in the

undergrowth of the hearts of the two girls stalked boldly

about in full daylight.
“He’s done it, and he’s done it to spite me!” murmured

Lady Southminster tearfully.
“Oh no!” Audrey protested. “Even if he had fallen

overboard he’d have been seen and the captain would have

stopped the boat.”
“Where do you come from?” Lady Southminster

retorted with disdain. “That’s an omen, that is"—pointing

to the words on the cover of the magazine. “What else

could it be? I ask you.”
When Miss Ingate returned the child was fast asleep.

Miss Ingate was paler than usual. Having convinced herself

that the sleeper did genuinely sleep, she breathed to Audrey:
“He’s in the next compartment! ... He must have

hidden himself till nearly the last minute on the boat and then

got into the train while we were sending off that telegram.”
Audrey blenched.
“Shall you wake her?”
“Wake her, and have a scene—with us here? No, I

shan’t. He’s a fool.”
“How d’you know?” asked Audrey.
“Well, he must have been a fool to marry her.”
“Well,” whispered Audrey. “If I’d been a man I’d have

married that face like a shot.”
“It might be all right if he’d only married the face. But

he’s married what she calls her mind.”
“Is he young?”
“Yes. And as good-looking in his own way as she is.”
“Well—”
But the Countess of Southminster stirred, and the slight

movement stopped conversation.
The journey was endless, but it was no longer than the

sleep of the Countess. At length dusk and mist began to

gather in the hollows of the land; stations succeeded one

another more frequently. The reflections of the electric

lights in the compartment could be seen beyond the glass of

the windows. The train still ruthlessly clattered and shook

and swayed and thundered; and weary lords, ladies and

financiers had read all the illustrated magazines and six-penny

novels in existence, and they lolled exhausted and

bored amid the debris of literature and light refreshments.

Then the speed of the convoy slackened, and Audrey, looking

forth, saw a pale cathedral dome resting aloft amid dark

clouds. It was a magical glimpse, and it was the first

glimpse of Paris. “Oh!” cried Audrey, far more like a girl

than a widow. The train rattled through defiles of high

twinkling houses, roared under bridges, screeched, threaded

forests of cold blue lamps, and at last came to rest under a

black echoing vault.
Paris!
And, mysteriously, all Audrey’s illusions concerning

France had been born again. She was convinced that Paris

could not fail to be paradisiacal.
Lady Southminster awoke.
Almost simultaneously a young man very well dressed

passed along the corridor. Lady Southminster, with an

awful start, seized her bag and sprang after him, but was

impeded by other passengers. She caught him only after

he had descended to the platform, which was at the bottom

of a precipice below the windows. He had just been saluted

by, and given orders to, a waiting valet. She caught

him sharply by the arm. He shook free and walked quickly

away up the platform, guided by a wise instinct for avoiding

a scene in front of fellow-travellers. She followed close

after him, talking with rapidity. They receded. Audrey

and Miss Ingate leaned out of the windows to watch, and

still farther and farther out. Just as the honeymooning

pair disappeared altogether their two forms came into

contact, and Audrey’s eyes could see the arm of Lord

Southminster take the arm of Lady Southminster. They

vanished from view like one flesh. And Audrey and Miss

Ingate, deserted, forgotten utterly, unthanked, buffeted by

passengers and by the valet who had climbed up into the

carriage to take away the impedimenta of his master, gazed

at each other and then burst out laughing.
“So that’s marriage!” said Audrey.
“No,” said Miss Ingate. “That’s love. I’ve seen a

deal of love in my time, ever since my sister Arabella’s

first engagement, but I never saw any that wasn’t vehy,

vehy queer.”
“I do hope they’ll be happy,” said Audrey.
“Do you?” said Miss Ingate.

CHAPTER VIII
EXPLOITATION OF WIDOWHOOD
The carriage had emptied, and the two adventurers stood

alone among empty compartments. The platform was also

empty. Not a porter in sight. One after the other, the

young widow and the elderly spinster, their purses bulging

with money, got their packages by great efforts down on

to the platform.
An employee strolled past.
“Porteur?” murmured Audrey timidly.
The man sniggered, shrugged his shoulders, and

vanished.
Audrey felt that she had gone back to her school days.

She was helpless, and Miss Ingate was the same. She

wished ardently that she was in Moze again. She could

not imagine how she had been such a fool as to undertake

this absurd expedition which could only end in ridicule

and disaster. She was ready to cry. Then another employee

appeared, hesitated, and picked up a bag, scowling and

inimical. Gradually the man, very tousled and dirty,

clustered all the bags and parcels around his person, and

walked off. Audrey and Miss Ingate meekly following.

The great roof of the station resounded to whistles and

the escape of steam and the clashing of wagons.
Beyond the platforms there were droves of people, of

whom nearly every individual was preoccupied and hurried.

And what people! Audrey had in her heart expected a

sort of glittering white terminus full of dandiacal men

and elegant Parisiennes who had stepped straight out of

fashion-plates, and who had no cares—for was not this

Paris? Whereas, in fact, the multitude was the dingiest

she had ever seen. Not a gleam of elegance! No hint of

dazzling colour! No smiling and satiric beauty! They

were just persons.
At last, after formalities, Audrey and Miss Ingate

reached the foul and chilly custom-house appointed for the

examination of luggage. Unrecognisable peers and other

highnesses stood waiting at long counters, forming bays,

on which was nothing at all. Then, far behind, a truck

hugely piled with trunks rolled in through a back door

and men pitched the trunks like toys here and there on

the counters, and officials came into view, and knots of

travellers gathered round trunks, and locks were turned

and lids were lifted, and the flash of linen showed in spots

on the drabness of the scene. Miss Ingate observed with

horror the complete undoing of a lady’s large trunk, and

the exposure to the world’s harsh gaze of the most intimate

possessions of that lady. Soon the counters were like a

fair. But no trunk belonging to Audrey or to Miss Ingate

was visible. They knew then, what they had both privately

suspected ever since Charing Cross, that their trunks would

be lost on the journey.
“Oh! My trunk!” cried Miss Ingate.
Beneath a pile of other trunks on an incoming truck

she had espied her property. Audrey saw it, too. The

vision was magical. The trunk seemed like a piece of

home, a bit of Moze and of England. It drew affection

from them as though it had been an animal. They sped

towards it, forgetting their small baggage. Their porteur

leaped over the counter from behind and made signs for

a key. All Audrey’s trunks in turn joined Miss Ingate’s;

none was missing. And finally an official, small and fierce,

responded to the invocations of the porteur and established

himself at the counter in front of them. He put his hand

on Miss Ingate’s trunk.
“Op-en,” he said in English.
Miss Ingate opened her purse, and indicated to the

official by signs that she had no key for the trunk,

and she also cried loudly, so that he should comprehend:
“No key! ... Lost!”
Then she looked awkwardly at Audrey.
“I’ve been told they only want to open one trunk

when there’s a lot. Let him choose another one,” she

murmured archly.
But the official merely walked away, to deal with the

trunks of somebody else close by.
Audrey was cross.
“Miss Ingate,” she said formally, “you had the key

when we started, because you showed it to me. You can’t

possibly have lost it.”
“No,” answered Winnie calmly and knowingly. “I

haven’t lost it. But I’m not going to have the things in

my trunk thrown about for all these foreigners to see. It’s

simply disgraceful. They ought to have women officials

and private rooms at these places. And they would have,

if women had the vote. Let him open one of your trunks.

All your things are new.”
The porteur had meanwhile been discharging French

into Audrey’s other ear.
“Of course you must open it, Winnie,” said she.

“Don’t be so absurd!” There was a persuasive lightness

in her voice, but there was also command. For a moment

she was the perfect widow.
“I’d rather not.”
“The porteur says we shall be here all night,” Audrey

persisted.
“Do you know French?”
“I learnt French at school, Winnie,” said the perfect

widow. “I can’t understand every word, but I can make

out the drift.” And Audrey went on translating the porter

according to her own wisdom. “He says there have been

dreadful scenes here before, when people have refused to

open their trunks, and the police have had to be called

in. He says the man won’t upset the things in your trunk

at all.”
Miss Ingate gazed into the distance, and privately smiled.

Audrey had never guessed that in Miss Ingate were such

depths of obstinate stupidity. She felt quite distinctly that

her understanding of human nature was increasing.
“Oh! Look!” said Miss Ingate casually. “I’m sure

those must be real Parisians!” Her offhandedness, her

inability to realise the situation, were exasperating to the

young widow. Audrey glanced where Miss Ingate had

pointed, and saw in the doorway of the custom-house two

women and a lad, all cloaked but all obviously in radiant

fancy dress, laughing together.
“Don’t they look French!” said Miss Ingate.
Audrey tapped her foot on the asphalt floor, while people

whose luggage had been examined bumped strenuously

against her in the effort to depart. She was extremely

pessimistic; she knew she could do nothing with Miss

Ingate; and the thought of the vast, flaring, rumbling city

beyond the station intimidated her. The porteur, who had

gone away to collect their neglected small baggage, now

returned, and nudged her, pointing to the official who had

resumed his place behind the trunks. He was certainly

a fierce man, but he was a little man, and there was an

agreeable peculiarity in his eye.
Audrey, suddenly inspired and emboldened, faced him;

she shrugged her shoulders Gallically at Miss Ingate’s

trunk, and gave a sad, sweet, wistful smile, and then

put her hand with an exquisite inviting gesture on the

smallest of her own trunks. The act was a deliberate

exploitation of widowhood. The official fiercely shrugged

his shoulders and threw up his arms, and told the porteur

to open the small trunk.
“I told you they would,” said Miss Ingate negligently.
Audrey would have turned upon her and slain her had

she not been busy with the tremendous realisation of the

fact that by a glance and a gesture she had conquered the

customs official—a foreigner and a stranger. She wanted

to be alone and to think.
Just as the trunk was being relocked, Audrey heard

an American girlish voice behind her:
“Now, you must be Miss Ingate!”
“I am,” Miss Ingate almost ecstatically admitted.
The trio in cloaked fancy dress were surrounding Miss

Ingate like a bodyguard.

CHAPTER IX
LIFE IN PARIS
Miss Thompkins and Miss Nickall were a charm to

dissipate all the affrighting menace of the city beyond the

station. Miss Thompkins had fluffy red hair, with the

freckles which too often accompany red hair, and was

addressed as Tommy. Miss Nickall had fluffy grey hair,

with warm, loving eyes, and was addressed as Nick. The

age of either might have been anything from twenty-four

to forty. The one came from Wyoming, the other from

Arizona; and it was instantly clear that they were close

friends. They had driven up to the terminus before going

to a fancy-dress ball to be given that night in the studio

of Monsieur Dauphin, a famous French painter and a

delightful man. They had met Monsieur Dauphin on the

previous evening on the terrace of the Café de Versailles,

and Monsieur had said, in response to their suggestion,

that he would be enchanted and too much honoured if they

would bring their English friends to his little “leaping"—that

was, hop.
Also they had thought that it would be nice for the

travellers to be met at the terminus, especially as Miss

Ingate had been very particularly recommended to Miss

Thompkins by a whole group of people in London. It

was Miss Thompkins who had supplied the address of

reliable furnished rooms, and she and Nick would personally

introduce the ladies to their landlady, who was a

sweet creature.
Tommy and Nick and Miss Ingate were at once on

terms of cordial informality; but the Americans seemed to

be a little diffident before the companion. Their voices,

at the introduction, had reinforced the surprise of their

first glances. “Oh! Mrs. Moncreiff!” The slightest

insistence, no more, on the “Mrs."! Nothing said, but

evidently they had expected somebody else!
Then there was the boy, whom they called Musa. He

was dark, slim, with timorous great eyes, and attired in

red as a devil beneath his student’s cloak. He apologised

slowly in English for not being able to speak English.

He said he was very French, and Tommy and Nick smiled,

and he smiled back at them rather wistfully. When Tommy

and Nick had spoken with the chauffeurs in French he

interpreted their remarks. There were two motor-taxis,

one for the luggage.
Miss Thompkins accompanied the luggage; she insisted

on doing so. She could tell sinister tales of Paris cabmen,

and she even delayed the departure in order to explain

that once in the suburbs and in the pre-taxi days a cabman

had threatened to drive her and himself into the Seine

unless she would be his bride, and she saved herself by

promising to be his bride and telling him that she lived

in the Avenue de l’Opéra; as soon as the cab reached a

populous thoroughfare she opened the cab door and squealed

and was rescued; she had let the driver go free because

of his good taste.
As the procession whizzed through nocturnal streets,

some thunderous with traffic, others very quiet, but all

lined with lofty regular buildings, Audrey was penetrated

by the romance of this city where cabmen passionately and

to the point of suicide and murder adored their fares.

And she thought that perhaps, after all, Madame Piriac’s

impression of Paris might not be entirely misleading. Miss

Ingate and Nick talked easily, very charmed with one

another, both excited. Audrey said little, and the dark

youth said nothing. But once the dark youth murmured

shyly to Audrey in English:
“Do you play at ten-nis, Madame?”
They crossed a thoroughfare that twinkled and glittered

from end to end with moving sky-signs. Serpents pursued

burning serpents on the heights of that thoroughfare, invisible

hands wrote mystic words of warning and invitation,

and blazing kittens played with balls of incandescent wool.

Throngs of promenaders moved under theatrical trees that

waved their pale emerald against the velvet sky, and the

ground floor of every edifice was a glowing café, whose

tables, full of idle sippers and loungers, bulged out on to

the broad pavements.... The momentary vision was shut

off instantly as the taxis shot down the mouth of a dark

narrow street; but it had been long enough to make Audrey’s

heart throb.
“What is that?” she asked.
“That?” exclaimed Nick kindly. “Oh! That’s only

the grand boulevard.”
Then they crossed the sombre, lamp-reflecting Seine, and

soon afterwards the two taxis stopped at a vast black door

in a very wide street of serried palatial façades that were

continually shaken by the rushing tumult of electric cars.

Tommy jumped out and pushed a button, and the door

automatically split in two, disclosing a vast and dim tunnel.

Tommy ran within, and came out again with a coatless man

in a black-and-yellow striped waistcoat and a short white

apron. This man, Musa, and the two chauffeurs entered

swiftly into a complex altercation, which endured until

Audrey had paid the chauffeurs and all the trunks had been

transported behind the immense door and the door bangingly

shut.
“Vehy amusing, isn’t it?” whispered Miss Ingate

caustically to Audrey. “Aren’t they dears?”
“Madame Dubois’s establishment is on the third and

fourth floors,” said Nick.
They climbed a broad, curving, carpeted staircase.
“We’re here,” said Audrey to Miss Ingate after scores

of stairs.
Miss Ingate, breathless, could only smile.
And Audrey profoundly felt that she was in Paris. The

mere shape of the doorknob by the side of a brass plate

lettered “Madame Dubois” told her that she was in an

exotic land.
And in the interior of Madame Dubois’s establishment

Tommy and Nick together drew apart the curtains, opened

the windows, and opened the shutters of a pleasantly stuffy

sitting-room. Everybody leaned out, and they saw the

superb thoroughfare, straight and interminable, and the

moving roofs of the tram-cars, and dwarfs on the pavements.

The night was mild and languorous.
“You see that!” Nick pointed to a blaze of electricity

to the left on the opposite side of the road. “That’s where

we shall take you to dine, after you’ve spruced yourselves up.

You needn’t bother about fancy dress. Monsieur Dauphin

always has stacks of kimonos—for his models, you know.”
While the travellers spruced themselves up in different bedrooms,

Tommy chattered through one pair of double doors

ajar, and Nick through the other, and Musa strummed with

many mistakes on an antique Pleyel piano. And as Audrey

listened to the talk of these acquaintances, Tommy and Nick,

who in half an hour had put on the hue of her lifelong friends,

and as she heard the piano, and felt the vibration of cars far

beneath, she decided that she was still growing happier and

happier, and that life and the world were marvellous.
A little later they passed into the café-restaurant through

a throng of seated sippers who were spread around its portals

like a defence. The interior, low, and stretching backwards,

apparently endless, into the bowels of the building,

was swimming in the brightest light. At a raised semicircular

counter in the centre two women were enthroned,

plump, sedate, darkly dressed, and of middle age. To these

priestesses came a constant succession of waiters, in the

classic garb of waiters, bearing trays which they offered

to the gaze of the women, and afterwards throwing down

coins that rang on the marble of the counter. One of the

women wrote swiftly in a great tome. Both of them, while

performing their duties, glanced continually into every part

of the establishment, watching especially each departure and

each arrival.
At scores of tables were the most heterogeneous collection

of people that Audrey had ever seen; men and women,

girls and old men, even a few children with their mothers.

Liquids were of every colour, ices chromatic, and the scarlet

of lobster made a luscious contrast with the shaded tints of

salads. In the extreme background men were playing billiards

at three tables. Though nearly everybody was talking,

no one talked loudly, so that the resulting monotone of

conversation was a gentle drone, out of which shot up at

intervals the crash of crockery or a hoarse command. And

this drone combined itself with the glittering light, and with

the mild warmth that floated in waves through the open windows,

and with the red plush of the seats, and with the rosiness

of painted nymphs on the blue walls, and with the

complexions of women’s faces, and their hats and frocks,

and with the hues of the liquids—to produce a totality of

impression that made Audrey dizzy with ecstasy. This was

not the Paris set forth by Madame Piriac, but it was a wondrous

Paris, and in Audrey’s esteem not far removed from

heaven.
Miss Ingate, magnificently pale, followed Tommy and

Nick with ironic delight up the long passage between the

tables. Her eyes seemed to be saying: “I am overpowered,

and yet there is something in me that is not overpowered, and

by virtue of my kind-hearted derision I, from Essex, am

superior to you all!” Audrey, with glance downcast, followed

Miss Ingate, and Musa came last, sinuously. Nobody

looked up at them more than casually, but at intervals during

the passage Tommy and Nick nodded and smiled: “How

d’ye do? How d’ye do?” “Bon soir,“ and answers were

given in American or French voices.
They came to rest near the billiard tables, and near an

aperture with a shelf where all the waiters congregated to

shout their orders. A grey-haired waiter, with the rapidity

and dexterity of a conjurer, laid a cloth over the marble

round which they sat, Audrey and Miss Ingate on the plush

bench, and Tommy and Nick, with Musa between them, on

chairs opposite. The waiter then discussed with them for

five minutes what they should eat, and he argued the problem

seriously, wisely, helpfully, as befitted. It was Audrey,

in full view of a buffet laden with shell-fish and fruit, who

first suggested lobster, and lobster was chosen, nothing but

lobster. Miss Ingate said that she was not a bit tired, and

that lobster was her dream. The sentiment was universal

at the table. When asked what she would drink, Audrey

was on the point of answering “lemonade.” But a doubt

about the propriety of everlasting lemonade for a widow with

much knowledge of the world, stopped her.
“I vote we all have grenadines,” said Nick.
Grenadine was agreeable to Audrey’s ear, and everyone

concurred.
The ordering was always summarised and explained by

Musa in a few phrases which, to Audrey, sounded very different

from the French of Tommy and Nick. And she took

oath that she would instantly begin to learn to speak French,

not like Tommy and Nick, whose accent she cruelly despised,

but like Musa.
Then Tommy and Nick removed their cloaks, and sat displayed

as a geisha and a contadina, respectively. Musa had

already unmasked his devilry. The café was not in the least

disturbed by these gorgeous and strange apparitions. An

orchestra began to play. Lobster arrived, and high glasses

full of glinting green. Audrey ate and drank with gusto,

with innocence, with the intensest love of life. And she was

the most beautiful and touching sight in the café-restaurant.

Miss Ingate, grinning, caught her eye with joyous mockery.

“We are going it, aren’t we, Audrey?” shrieked Miss Ingate.
Miss Thompkins and Miss Nickall began slowly to differentiate

themselves in Audrey’s mind. At first they were

merely two American girls—the first Audrey had met. They

were of about the same age—whatever that age might be—and

if they were not exactly of the same age, then Tommy

with red hair was older than Nick with grey hair. Indeed,

Nick took the earliest opportunity to remark that her hair

had turned grey at nineteen. They both had dreamy eyes

that looked through instead of looking at; they were both

hazy concerning matters of fact; they were both attached

like a couple of aunts to Musa, who nestled between them

like a cat between two cushions; they were both extraordinarily

friendly and hospitable; they both painted and both

had studios—in the same house; they both showed quite

a remarkable admiration and esteem for all their acquaintances;

and they both lacked interest in their complexions

and their hair.
The resemblance did not go very much farther. Tommy,

for all her praising of friends, was of a critical, curious, and

analytical disposition, and her greenish eyes were always at

work qualifying in a very subtle manner what her tongue

said, when her tongue was benevolent, as it often was.

Feminism and suffragism being the tie between the new

acquaintances, these subjects were the first material of conversation,

and an empress of militancy known to the world

as “Rosamund” having been mentioned, Miss Ingate said

with enthusiasm:
“She lives only for one thing.”
“Yes,” replied Tommy. “And if she got it, I guess no

one would be more disgusted than she herself.”
There was an instant’s silence.
“Oh, Tommy!” Nick lovingly protested.
Said Miss Ingate with a comprehending satiric grin:
“I see what you mean. I quite see. I quite see. You’re

right, Miss Thompkins. I’m sure you’re right.”
Audrey decided she would have to be very clever in

order to be equal to Tommy’s subtlety. Nick, on the other

hand, was not a bit subtle, except when she tried to imitate

Tommy. Nick was kindness, and sympathy, and vagueness.

You could see these admirable qualities in every curve of her

face and gleam of her eyes. She was very sympathetic, but

somewhat shocked when Audrey blurted out that she had not

come to Paris in order to paint.
“There are at least fifty painters in this café this very

minute,” said Tommy. And somehow it was just as if she

had said: “If you haven’t come to Paris to paint, what have

you come for?”
“Does Mr. Musa paint, too?” asked Audrey.
“Oh no!” Both his protectresses answered together,

pained. Tommy added: “Musa plays the violin—of course.”
And Musa blushed. Later, he murmured to Audrey

across the table, while Tommy was ordering a salad, that

there were tennis courts in the Luxembourg gardens.
“I used to paint,” Miss Ingate broke out. “And I’m

beginning to think I should like to paint again.”
Said Nick, enraptured:
“I’ll let you use my studio, if you will. I’d just love you

to, now! Where did you study?”
“Well, it was like this,” said Miss Ingate with satisfaction.

“It was a long time ago. I finished painting a

dog-kennel because the house-painter’s wife died and he had

to go to her funeral, and the dog didn’t like being kept waiting.

That gave me the idea. I went into water-colours, but

afterwards I went back to oils. Oils seemed more real. Then

I started on portraits, and I did a portrait of my Aunt Sarah

from memory. After she saw it she tore up her will, and

before I could get her into a good temper again she married

her third husband and she had to make a new will in favour

of him. So I found painting very expensive. Not that it

would have made any difference, I suppose, would it? After

that I went into miniatures. The same dog that I painted

the kennel for ate up the best miniature I ever did. It killed

him. I put a cross over his grave in the garden. All that

made me see what a fool I’d been, and I exchanged my painting

things for a lawn-mower, but it never turned out to be

any good.”
“You dear! You precious! You priceless!” cooed Nick.

“I shall fix up my second best easel for you to-morrow.”
“Isn’t she just too lovely!” Tommy murmured aside to

Audrey.
“I not much understand,” said Musa.
Tommy translated to him, haltingly, and Audrey was

moved to say, with energy:
“What I want most is to learn French, and I’m going

to begin to-morrow morning.”
Nick was kindly confusing and shaming Miss Ingate

with a short history and catechism of modern art, including

such names as Vuillard, Bonnard, Picasso, Signac, and

Matisse—all very eagerly poured out and all very unnerving

for Miss Ingate, whose directory of painting was practically

limited to the names of Raphael, Sir Joshua, Rembrandt,

Rubens, Gainsborough, Turner, Leighton, Millais, Gustave

Doré and Frank Dicksee. When, however, Nick referred

to Monsieur Dauphin, Miss Ingate was as it were washed

safely ashore and said with assurance: “Oh yes! Oh

yes! Oh yes!”
Tommy listened for a few moments, and then, leaning

across the table and lighting a cigarette, she said in an

intimate undertone to Audrey: “I hope you don’t mind

coming to the ball to-night. We really didn’t know———”

She stopped. Her eyes, ferreting in Audrey’s black, completed

the communication.
Unnerved for the tenth of a second, Audrey recovered

and answered:
“Oh, no! I shall like it very much.”
“You’ve been up against life!” murmured Tommy in a

melting voice, gazing at her. “But how wonderful all experience

is, isn’t it. I once had a husband. We separated—at

least, he separated. But I know the feel of being a wife.”
Audrey blushed deeply. She wanted to push away all

that sympathy, and she was exceedingly alarmed by the

revelation that Tommy was an initiate. The widow was

the merest schoolgirl once more. But her blush had saved

her from a chat in which she could not conceivably have

held her own.
“Excuse me being so clumsy,” said Tommy contritely.

“Another time.” And she waved her cigarette to the waiter

in demand for the bill.
It was after the orchestra had finished a tango, and

while Tommy was examining the bill, that the first violin

and leader, in a magenta coat, approached the table, and

with a bow offered his violin deferentially to Musa. Many

heads turned to watch what would happen. But Musa only

shrugged his shoulders and with an exquisite gesture of

refusal signified that he had to leave. Whereupon the

magenta coat gracefully retired, starting a Hungarian

dance as he went.
“Musa is supposed to be the greatest violinist in Paris—perhaps

in the world,” Tommy whispered casually to

Audrey. “He used to play here, till Dauphin discovered

him.”
Audrey, overcome by this prodigious blow, trembled at

the contemplation of her blind stupidity.
Beyond question, Musa now looked extremely important,

vivid, masterful. She had been mistaking him for a nice,

ornamental, useless boy.

CHAPTER X
FANCY DRESS
Just as the café-restaurant had been an intensification of

ordinary life, so was the ball in Dauphin’s studio an intensification

of the café-restaurant. It had more colour, more

noise, more music, more heat, more varied kinds of people,

and, of course, far more riotous movement than the café-restaurant.

The only quality in which the café-restaurant

stood first was that of sustenance. Monsieur Dauphin had

not attempted to rival the café-restaurant in the matter of

food and drink. And that there was no general hope of

his doing so could be deduced from the fact that many

of the more experienced guests arrived with bottles, fruit,

sausages, and sandwiches of their own.
When Audrey and her friends entered the precincts of

the vast new white building in the Boulevard Raspail, upon

whose topmost floor Monsieur Dauphin painted the portraits

of the women of the French, British, and American plutocracies

and aristocracies, a lift full of gay-coloured figures

was just shooting upwards past the wrought-iron balustrades

of the gigantic staircase. Tommy and Nick stopped to speak

to a columbine who hovered between the pavement and the

threshold of the house.
“I don’t know whether it’s the grenadine or the lobster,

or whether it’s Paris,” said Miss Ingate confidentially in the

interval; “but I can scarcely tell whether I’m standing on

my head or my heels.”
Before the Americans rejoined them, the lift had returned

and ascended with another covey of fancy costumes, including

a man with a nose a foot long and a girl with bright

green hair, dressed as an acrobat. On its next journey the

lift held Tommy and Nick’s party, and it held no more.
When the party emerged from it, they were greeted with

a cheer, hoarse and half human, by a band of light amateur

mountebanks of both sexes who were huddled in a doorway.

Within a quarter of an hour Audrey and Miss Ingate, after

astounding struggles in a dressing-room in which Nick alone

saved their lives and reputations, appeared in Japanese disguise

according to promise, and nobody could tell whether

Audrey was maid, wife, or widow. She might have been a

creature created on the spot, for the celestial purpose of a

fancy-dress ball in Monsieur Dauphin’s studio.
The studio was very large and rather lofty. Its walls

had been painted by gifted pupils of Monsieur Dauphin

and by fellow-artists, with scenes of life according to

Catullus, Theocritus, Propertius, Martial, Petronius, and

other classical writers. It is not too much to say that the

walls of the studio constituted a complete novelty for Audrey

and Miss Ingate. Miss Ingate opened her mouth to say

something, but, saying nothing, forgot for a long time to

shut it again.
Chinese lanterns, electrically illuminated, were strung

across the studio at a convenient height so that athletic

dancers could prodigiously leap up and make them swing.

Beneath this incoherent but exciting radiance the guests

swayed and glided, in a joyous din, under the influence of

an orchestra of men snouted like pigs and raised on a dais.

In a corner was a spiral staircase leading to the flat roof

of the studio and a view of all Paris. Up and down this

corkscrew contending parties fought amiably for the right

of way.
Tommy and Nick began instantly to perform introductions

between Audrey and Miss Ingate and the other guests.

In a few moments Audrey had failed to catch the names of

a score and a half of people—many Americans, some French,

some Argentine, one or two English. They were all very

talented people, and, according to Miss Ingate, the most

characteristically French were invariably either Americans

or Argentines.
A telephone bell rang in the distance, and presently a

toreador stood on a chair and pierced the music with a

message of yells in French, and the room hugely guffawed

and cheered.
“Where is the host?” Audrey asked.
“That’s what the telephoning was about,” said Tommy,

speaking loudly against the hubbub. “He hasn’t come yet.

He had to rush off this afternoon to do pastel portraits of two

Russian princesses at St. Germain, and he hasn’t got back

yet. The telephone was to say that he’s started.”
Then one of the introduced—it was a girl wearing a mask

—took Audrey by the waist and whirled her strongly away

and she was lost in the maze. Audrey’s first impulse was to

protest, but she said to herself: “Why protest? This is

what we’re here for.” And she gave herself up to the dance.

Her partner held her very firmly, somewhat bending over

her. Neither spoke. Gyrating in long curves, with the other

dancers swishing mysteriously about them like the dancers of

a dream, and the music as far off as another world, they

clung together in the rhythm and in the enchantment, until

the music ceased.... The strong girl threw Audrey carelessly

off, and walked away, breathing hard. And there was

something in the strong girl’s nonchalant and curt departure

which woke a chord in Audrey’s soul that had never been

wakened before. Audrey could scarcely credit that she was

on the same planet as Essex. She had many dances with

men whom she hoped and believed she had been introduced to

by Tommy, and no less than seventeen persons of either sex

told her in unusual English that they had heard she wanted

to learn French and that they would like to teach her; and

then she met Musa, the devil.
Musa, with an indolent and wistful smile, suggested the

roof. Audrey was now just one of the throng, and quite

unconscious of herself; she fought archly and gaily on the

spiral staircase exactly as she had seen others do, and at last

they were on the roof, and the silhouettes of other fantastic

figures and of cowled chimney pots stood out dark against the

vague yellow glow of the city beneath. While Musa was

pointing out the historic landmarks to her, she was thinking

how she could never again be the girl who had left Moze

on the previous morning. And yet Musa was so natural and

so direct that it was impossible to take him for anything but

a boy, and hence Audrey sank back into early girlhood,

talking spasmodically to Musa as she used in school days to

talk to the brother of her school friend.
“I will teach you French,” said Musa, unaware that he

had numerous predecessors in the offer. “But will you play

tennis with me in the gardens of the Luxembourg?”
Audrey said she would, and that she would buy a

racket.
“Tell me about all those artists Miss Nickall spoke of,”

she said. “I must know about all the artists, and all the

musicians, and all the authors. I must know all about them

at once. I shan’t sleep until I know all their names and I

can talk French. I shan’t sleep.”
Musa began the catalogue. When a girl came and

chucked him under the chin, he angrily slapped her face.

Then, to avoid complications, they descended.
In the middle of the studio, wearing a silk hat, a morning

coat, striped trousers, yellow gloves, and boots with spats,

stood a smiling figure.
“Voilà Dauphin!” said Musa.
“Musa!” called Monsieur Dauphin, espying the youth on

the staircase. Then he made a gesture to the orchestra:

“Give him a violin!”
Audrey stood by Musa while he played a dance that nobody

danced to, and when he had finished she was rather

ashamed, under the curtain of wild cheering, because with her

Essex incredulity she had not sufficiently believed in Musa’s

greatness.
“Permit your host to introduce himself,” said a voice

behind her, not in the correct English of a linguistic Frenchman,

but in utterly English English. She had now

descended to the floor of the studio.
Emile Dauphin raised his glossy hat, and then asked to

be allowed to put it on again, as the company had decided

that it was part of his costume. He had a delicious smile, at

once respectful and intimate. Audrey had read somewhere

that really great men were always simple and unaffected—indeed

that it was often impossible to guess from their

demeanour that, etc., etc.—and this experience of the first

celebrity with whom she had ever spoken (except Musa, who

was somehow only Musa) confirmed the statement, and confirmed

also her young instinctive belief that what is printed

must be true. She was beginning to feel the stealthy on-comings

of fatigue, and certainly she was very nervous, but

Monsieur Dauphin’s quite particularly sympathetic manner,

and her own sudden determination not to be a little blushing

fool gave her new power.
“I can’t express to you,” he said, moving towards the

dais and mesmerising her to keep by his side. “I can’t

express to you how sorry I was to be so late.” He made

the apology with lightness, but with sincerity. Audrey knew

how polite the French were. “But truly circumstances were

too much for me. Those two Russian princesses—they came

to me through a mutual friend, a dear old friend of mine,

very closely attached also to them. They leave to-morrow

morning by the St. Petersburg express, on which they have

engaged a special coach. What was I to do? I tried to

tear myself away earlier, but of course there were the portrait

sketches to finish, and no doubt you know the usage of the

best society in Russia.”
“Yes,” murmured Audrey.
“Come up on the dais, will you?” he suggested. “And

let us survey the scene together.”
They surveyed the scene together. The snouted band

was having supper on the floor in a corner, and many

of the guests also were seated on the floor. Miss Ingate,

intoxicated by the rapture of existence, and Miss

Thompkins were carefully examining the frescoes on

the walls. A young woman covered from head to foot with

gold tinsel was throwing chocolates into Musa’s mouth, or

as near to it as she could.
“What a splendid player Mr. Musa is!” Audrey inaugurated

her career as a woman of the world. “I doubt

if I have ever heard such violin playing.”
“I’m so glad you think so,” replied Monsieur Dauphin.

“Of course you know I’m very conceited about my

painting. Anybody will tell you so. But beneath all that

I’m not so sure. I often have the gravest doubts about

my work. But I never had any doubt that when I took

Musa out of the orchestra in the Café de Versailles I was

giving a genius to the world. And perhaps that’s how

I shall be remembered by posterity. And if it is I shall

be content.”
Never before had Audrey heard anybody connect himself

with posterity, and she was very much impressed. Monsieur

Dauphin was resigned and yet brave. By no means convinced

that posterity would do the right thing, he nevertheless

had no grudge against posterity.
Just then there was a sharp scream at the top of the

spiral staircase. With a smile that condoned the scream

and excused his flight, Monsieur Dauphin ran to the

staircase, and up it, and disappeared on to the roof.

Nobody seemed to be perturbed. Audrey was left alone

and conspicuous on the dais.
“Charming, isn’t he?” said Miss Thompkins, arriving

with Miss Ingate in front of the flower-screened

platform.
“Oh! he is!” answered Audrey with sincerity, leaning

downwards.
“Has he told you all about the Russian princesses?”
“Oh, yes,” said Audrey, pleased.
“I thought he would,” said Miss Thompkins, with a

peculiar intonation.
Audrey knew then that Miss Thompkins, having first

maliciously made sure that she was a ninny, was now

telling her to her face that she was a ninny.
Tommy continued:
“Then I guess he told you he’d given Musa to the

world.”
Audrey nodded.
“Ah! I knew he would. Well, when he comes back

he’ll tell you that you must come to one of his real

entertainments here, and that this one is nothing. Then

he’ll tell you about all the nobs he knows in London. And

at last he’ll say that you have a strangely expressive face,

and he’d like to paint it and show the picture in the

Salon. But he won’t tell you it’ll cost you forty thousand

francs. So I’ll tell you that, because perhaps later on,

if you don’t know, you might find yourself making a noise

like a tenderfoot. You see, Miss Ingate hasn’t concealed

that you’re a lady millionaire.”
“No, I haven’t,” said Miss Ingate, glowing and yet

sarcastic. “I couldn’t bring myself to, because I was so

anxious to see if human nature in Paris is anything like

what it is in Essex.”
“And why should you hide it, Winnie?” Audrey stoutly

demanded.
“Well, au revoir,” Tommy murmured delicately, with

a very original gesture. “He’s coming back.”
As Monsieur Dauphin, having apparently established

peace on the roof, approached again, Audrey discreetly

examined his face and his demeanour, to see if she could

perceive in him any of the sinister things that Tommy

had implied. She was unable to make up her mind whether

she could or not. But in the end she decided that she

was as shrewd as anybody in the place.
“Have you been to my roof-garden, Mrs. Moncreiff?”

he asked in a persuasive voice, raising his eyebrows.
She said she had, and that she thought the roof was

heavenly.
Then from the corner of her eye she saw Miss Ingate

and Tommy sidling mischievously away, like conspirators

who have lighted a time fuse. She considered that Tommy,

with her red hair and freckles, and strange glances and

strange tones full of a naughty and malicious sweetness,

was even more peculiar than Miss Ingate. But she was

not intimidated by them nor by the illustrious Monsieur

Dauphin, so perfectly master of his faculties. Rather she

was exultant in the contagion of their malice. Once more

she felt as if she had ceased to be a girl a very long

time ago. And she was aware of agreeable and exciting

temptations.
“Are you taking a house in Paris?” inquired Monsieur

Dauphin.
Audrey answered primly:
“I haven’t decided. Should you advise me to do so?”
He waved a hand.
“Ah! It depends on the life you wish to lead. Who

knows—with a young woman who has all experience behind

her and all life before her! But I do hope I may see

you again. And I trust I may persuade you to come to

my studio again.” Audrey felt the thrill of drama as he

proceeded. “This is scarcely a night for you. I ought

to tell you that I give three entertainments during the

autumn. To-night is the first. It is for students and those

English and Americans who think they are seeing Paris

here. Then I give another for the political and dramatic

worlds. Each is secretly proud to meet the other. The

third I reserve to my friends. Some of my many friends

in London are good enough to come over specially for it.

It is on Christmas Eve. I do wish you would come to

that one.”
“I suppose,” she said, catching the diabolic glances of

Miss Ingate and Tommy, “I suppose you know almost

more people in London than in Paris?”
He answered:
“Well, I count among my friends more than two-thirds

of the subscribers to Covent Garden Opera.... By the

way, do you happen to be connected with the Moncreiffs

of Suddon Wester? They have a charming house in Hyde

Park Terrace. But probably you know it?”
Audrey burst out laughing. She laughed loud and

violently till the tears stood in her eyes.
“Well,” he said, at a loss, deprecatingly. “Perhaps

these Moncreiffs are rather weird.”
“I was only laughing,” she said in gasps, but with a

complete secret composure. “Because we had such an awful

quarrel with them last year. I couldn’t tell you the details.

They’re too shocking.”
He gave a dubious smile.
“D’you know, dear young lady,” he recommenced after

a brief pause, “I should adore to paint a portrait of you

laughing. It would be very well hung in the Salon. Your

face is so strangely expressive. It is utterly different, in

expression, from any other face I ever saw—and I have

studied faces.”
Heedless of the general interest which she was arousing,

Audrey leaned on the rail of the screen of flowers, and

gave herself up afresh to laughter. Monsieur Dauphin

was decidedly puzzled. The affair might have ended in

hysteria and confusion had not Miss Ingate, with Nick

and Tommy, come hurrying up to the dais.

CHAPTER XI
A POLITICAL REFUGEE
“Rosamund has come to my studio and wants to see me

at once. She has sent for me. Miss Ingate says she

shall go, too.”
It was these words in a highly emotionalised voice from

Miss Nickall that, like a vague murmured message of vast

events, drew the entire quartet away from the bright

inebriated scene created by Monsieur Dauphin.
The single word “Rosamund” sufficed to break one

mood and induce another in all bosoms save that of Audrey,

who was in a state of permanent joyous exultation that

she scarcely even attempted to control. The great militant

had a surname, but it was rarely used save by police

magistrates. Her Christian name alone was more impressive

than the myriad cognomens of queens and princesses. Miss

Nickall ran away home at once. Miss Thompkins was

left to deliver Miss Ingate and Audrey at Nick’s studio,

which, being in the Rue Delambre, was not far away.

And not the shedding of the kimono and the re-assumption

of European attire could affect Audrey’s spirits. Had

she been capable of regret in that hour, she would have

regretted the abandonment of the ball, where the refined,

spiritual, strange faces of the men, and the enigmatic

quality of the women, and the exceeding novelty of the

social code had begun to arouse in her sentiments of

approval and admiration. But she quitted the staggering

frolic without a sigh; for she carried within her a frolic

surpassing anything exterior or physical.
The immense flickering boulevard with its double

roadway stretched away to the horizon on either hand,

empty.
“What time is it?” asked Miss Ingate.
Tommy looked at her wrist-watch.
“Don’t tell me! Don’t tell me!” cried Audrey.
“We might get a taxi in the Rue de Babylone,” Tommy

suggested. “Or shall we walk?”
“We must walk,” cried Audrey.
She knew the name of the street. In the distance she

could recognise the dying lights of the café-restaurant where

they had eaten. She felt already like an inhabitant of

the dreamed-of city. It was almost inconceivable to her

that she had been within it for only a few hours, and that

England lay less than a day behind her in the past, and

Moze less than two days. And Aguilar the morose, and

the shuttered rooms of Flank Hall, shot for an instant into

her mind and out again.
The other two women walked rather quickly, mesmerised

possibly by the magic of the illustrious Christian name,

and Audrey gave occasional schoolgirlish leaps by their

side. A little policeman appeared inquisitive from a by-street,

and Audrey tossed her head as if saying: “Pooh! I belong

here. All the mystery of this city is mine, and I am as

at home as in Moze Street.”
And as they surged through the echoing solitude of

the boulevard, and as they crossed the equally tremendous

boulevard that cut through it east and west, Tommy told

the story of Nick’s previous relations with Rosamund. Nick

had met Rosamund once before through her English chum,

Betty Burke, an art student who had ultimately sacrificed

art to the welfare of her sex, but who with Mrs. Burke

had shared rooms and studio with Nick for many months.

Tommy’s narrative was spotted with hardly perceptible

sarcasms concerning art, women, Betty Burke, Mrs. Burke,

and Nick; but she put no barb into Rosamund. And

when Miss Ingate, who had never met Rosamund, asked

what Rosamund amounted to in the esteem of Tommy,

Tommy evaded the question. Miss Ingate remembered,

however, what she had said in the café-restaurant.
Then they turned into the Rue Delambre, and Tommy

halted them in the deep obscurity in front of another of

those huge black doors which throughout Paris seemed

to guard the secrets of individual life. An automobile

was waiting close by. A little door in the huge one

clicked and yielded, and they climbed over a step into

black darkness.
“Thompkins!” called Miss Thompkins loudly to the

black darkness, to reassure the drowsy concierge in his

hidden den, shutting the door with a bang behind them;

and, groping for the hands of the others, she dragged

them forward stumbling.
“I never have a match,” she said.
They blundered up tenebrous stairs.
“We’re just passing my door,” said Tommy. “Nick’s

is higher up.”
Then a perpendicular slit of light showed itself—and

a portal slightly open could be distinguished.
“I shall quit here,” said Tommy. “You go right in.”
“You aren’t leaving us?” exclaimed Miss Ingate in

alarm.
“I won’t go in,” Tommy persisted in a quiet satiric

tone. “I’ll leave my door open below, and see you when

you come down.”
She could be heard descending.
“Why, I guess they’re here,” said a voice, Nick’s,

within, and the door was pulled wide open.
“My legs are all of a tremble!” muttered Miss Ingate.
Nick’s studio seemed larger than reality because of its

inadequate illumination. On a small paint-stained table

in the centre was an oil-lamp beneath a round shade that

had been decorated by some artist’s hand with a series

of reclining women in many colours. This lamp made a

moon in the midnight of the studio, but it was a moon

almost without rays; the shade seemed to imprison the

light, save that which escaped from its superior orifice.

Against the table stood a tall thin woman in black. Her

face was lit by the rays escaping upward; a pale, firm,

bland face, with rather prominent cheeks, loose grey hair

above, surmounted by a toque. The dress was dark, and

the only noticeable feature of it was that the sleeves were

finished in white linen; from these the hands emerged

calm and veined under the lampshade; in one of them

a pair of gloves were clasped. On the table lay a thin

mantle.
At the back of the studio there sat another woman, so

engloomed that no detail of her could be distinguished.
“As I was saying,” the tall upright woman resumed as

soon as Miss Ingate and Audrey had been introduced.

“Betty Burke is in prison. She got six weeks this morning.

She may never come out again. Almost her last words from

the dock were that you, Miss Nickall, should be asked to go

to London to look after Mrs. Burke, and perhaps to take

Betty’s place in other ways. She said that her mother preferred

you to anybody else, and that she was sure you would

come. Shall you?”
The accents were very clear, the face was delicately

smiling, the little gestures had a quite tranquil quality.

Rosamund did not seem to care whether Miss Nickall obeyed

the summons or not. She did not seem to care about anything

whatever except her own manner of existing. She was

the centre of Paris, and Paris was naught but a circumference

for her. All phenomena beyond the individuality of the

woman were reduced to the irrelevant and the negligible. It

would have been absurd to mention to her costume balls.

The frost of her indifference would have wilted them into

nothingness.
“Yes, of course, I shall go,” Nick answered.
“When?” was the implacable question.
“Oh! By the first train,” said Nick eagerly. As she

approached the lamp, the gleam of the devotee could be seen

in her gaze. In one moment she had sacrificed Paris and art

and Tommy and herself, and had risen to the sacred ardour

of a vocation. Rosamund was well accustomed to watching

the process, and she gave not the least sign of satisfaction or

approval.
“I ought to tell you,” she went on, “that I came over

from London suddenly by the afternoon service in order to

escape arrest. I am now a political refugee. Things have

come to this pass. You will do well to leave by the first

train. That is why I decided to call here before going to

bed.”
“Where’s Tommy?” asked Nick, appealing wildly to

Miss Ingate and Audrey. Upon being answered she said,

still more wildly: “I must see her. Can you—No, I’ll run

down myself.” In the doorway she turned round: “Mrs.

Moncreiff, would you and Miss Ingate like to have my studio

while I’m away? I should just love you to. There’s a very

nice bed over there behind the screen, and a fair sort of couch

over here. Do say you will! Do!”
“Oh! We will!” Miss Ingate replied at once, reassuringly,

as though in haste to grant the supreme request of

some condemned victim. And indeed Miss Nickall appeared

ready to burst into tears if she should be thwarted.
As soon as Nick had gone, Miss Ingate’s smiling face,

nervous, intimidated, audacious, sardonic, and good

humoured, moved out of the gloom nearer to Rosamund.
“You knew I played the barrel organ all down Regent

Street?” she ventured, blushing.
“Ah!” murmured Rosamund, unmoved. “It was you

who played the barrel-organ? So it was.”
“Yes,” said Miss Ingate. “But I’m like you. I don’t

care passionately for prison. Eh! Eh! I’m not so vehy,

vehy fond of it. I don’t know Miss Burke, but what a pity

she has got six weeks, isn’t it? Still, I was vehy much

struck by what someone said to me to-day—that you’d be

vehy sorry if women did get the vote. I think I should be

sorry, too—you know what I mean.”
“Perfectly,” ejaculated Rosamund, with a pleasant smile.
“I hope I’m not skidding,” said Miss Ingate still more

timidly, but also with a sardonic giggle, looking round into

the gloom. “I do skid sometimes, you know, and we’ve just

come away from a——”
She could not finish.
“And Mrs. Moncreiff, if I’ve got the name right, is she

with us, too?” asked Rosamund, miraculously urbane. And

added: “I hear she has wealth and is the mistress of it.”
Audrey jumped up, smiling, and lifting her veil. She

could not help smiling. The studio, the lamp, Rosamund

with her miraculous self-complacency, Nick with her soft,

mad eyes and wistful voice, the blundering ruthless Miss

Ingate, all seemed intensely absurd to her. Everything

seemed absurd except dancing and revelry and coloured lights

and strange disguises and sensuous contacts. She had the

most careless contempt, stiffened by a slight loathing, for

political movements and every melancholy effort to reform

the world. The world did not need reforming and did not

want to be reformed.
“Perhaps you don’t know my story,” Audrey began, not

realising how she would continue. “I am a widow. I made

an unhappy marriage. My husband on the day after our

wedding-day began to eat peas with his knife. In a week

I was forced to leave him. And a fortnight later I heard

that he was dead of blood-poisoning. He had cut his

mouth.”
And she thought:
“What is the matter with me? I have ruined myself.”

All her exultation had collapsed.
But Rosamund remarked gravely:
“It is a common story.”
Suddenly there was a movement in the obscure corner

where sat the unnamed and unintroduced lady. This lady

rose and came towards the table. She was very elegant in

dress and manner, and she looked maturely young.
“Madame Piriac,” announced Rosamund.
Audrey recoiled.... Gazing hard at the face, she saw

in it a vague but undeniable resemblance to certain admired

photographs which had arrived at Moze from France.
“Pardon me!” said Madame Piriac in English with a

strong French accent. “I shall like very much to hear the

details of this story of petits pois.” The tone of Madame

Piriac’s question was unexceptionable; it took account of

Audrey’s mourning attire, and of her youthfulness; but

Audrey could formulate no answer to it. Instead of speaking

she gave a touch to her veil, and it dropped before her

piquant, troubled, inscrutable face like a screen.
Miss Ingate said with noticeable calm, but also with

the air of a conspirator who sees danger to a most secret

machination:
“I’m afraid Mrs. Moncreiff won’t care to go into details.”
It was neatly done. Madame Piriac brought the episode

to a close with a sympathetic smile and an apposite gesture.

And Audrey, safe behind her veil, glanced gratefully and

admiringly at Miss Ingate, who, taken quite unawares, had

been so surprisingly able thus to get her out of a scrape.

She felt very young and callow among these three women,

and the mere presence of Madame Piriac, of whom years

ago she had created for herself a wondrous image, put her

into a considerable flutter. On the whole she was ready to

believe that the actual Madame Piriac was quite equal to the

image of her founded on photographs and letters. She set

her teeth, and decided that Madame Piriac should not

learn her identity—yet! There was little risk of her discovering

it for herself, for no photograph of Audrey had

gone to Paris for a dozen years, and Miss Ingate’s loyalty

was absolute.
As Audrey sat down again, the illustrious Rosamund took

a chair near her, and it could not be doubted that the woman

had the mien and the carriage of a leader.
“You are very rich, are you not?” asked Rosamund, in

a tone at once deferential and intimate, and she smiled very

attractively in the gloom. Impossible not to reckon with

that smile, as startling as it was seductive!
Evidently Nick had been communicative.
“I suppose I am,” murmured Audrey, like a child, and

feeling like a child. Yet at the same time she was asking

herself with fierce curiosity: “What has Madame Piriac got

to do with this woman?”
“I hear you have eight or ten thousand a year and can

do what you like with it. And you cannot be more than

twenty-three.... What a responsibility it must be for you!

You are a friend of Miss Ingate’s and therefore on our side.

Indeed, if a woman such as you were not on our side, I

wonder whom we could count on. Miss Ingate is, of course,

a subscriber to the Union—”
“Only a very little one,” cried Miss Ingate.
Audrey had never felt so abashed since an ex-parlourmaid

at Flank Hall, who had left everything to join the Salvation

Army, had asked her once in the streets of Colchester

whether she had found salvation. She knew that she, if any

one, ought to subscribe to the Suffragette Union, and to

subscribe largely. For she was a convinced suffragette by

faith, because Miss Ingate was a convinced suffragette. If

Miss Ingate had been a Mormon, Audrey also would have

been a Mormon. And, although she hated to subscribe, she

knew also that if Rosamund demanded from her any subscription,

however large—even a thousand pounds—she would

not know how to refuse. She felt before Rosamund as

hundreds of women, and not a few men, had felt.
“I may be leaving for Germany to-morrow,” Rosamund

proceeded. “I may not see you again—at any rate for many

weeks. May I write to London that you mean to support

us?”
Audrey was giving herself up for lost, and not without

reason. She foreshadowed a future of steely self-sacrifice,

propaganda, hammers, riots, and prison; with no self-indulgence

in it, no fine clothes, no art, and no young men

save earnest young men. She saw herself in the iron clutch

of her own conscience and sense of duty. And she was

frightened. But at that moment Nick rushed into the room,

and the spell was broken. Nick considered that she had the

right to monopolise Rosamund, and she monopolised her.
Miss Ingate prudently gathered Audrey to her side, and

was off with her. Nick ran to kiss them, and told them that

Tommy was waiting for them in the other studio. They

groped downstairs, guided by a wisp of light from Tommy’s

studio.
“Why didn’t you come up?” asked Miss Ingate of

Tommy in Tommy’s antechamber. “Have you and she

quarrelled?”
“Oh no!” said Tommy. “But I’m afraid of her. She’d

grab me if she had the least chance, and I don’t want to be

grabbed.”
Tommy was arranging to escort them home, and had

already got out on the landing, when Rosamund and Madame

Piriac, followed by Nick holding a candle aloft, came down

the stairs. A few words of explanation, a little innocent

blundering on the part of Nick, a polite suggestion by

Madame Piriac, and an imperious affirmative by Rosamund—and

the two strangers to Paris found themselves

in Madame Piriac’s waiting automobile on the way to

their rooms!
In the darkness of the car the four women could not distinguish

each other’s faces. But Rosamund’s voice was

audible in a monologue, and Miss Ingate trembled for

Audrey and for the future.
“This is the most important political movement in the

history of the world,” Rosamund was saying, not at all in a

speechifying manner, but quite intimately and naturally.

“Everybody admits that, and that’s what makes it so extraordinarily

interesting, and that is why we have had such

magnificent help from women in the very highest positions

who wouldn’t dream of touching ordinary politics. It’s a

marvellous thing to be in the movement, if we can only

realise it. Don’t you think so, Mrs. Moncreiff?”
Audrey made no response. The other two sat silent.

Miss Ingate thought:
“What’s the girl going to do next? Surely she could

mumble something.”
The car curved and stopped.
“Here we are,” said Miss Ingate, delighted. “And

thank you so much. I suppose all we have to do is just

to push the bell and the door opens. Now Audrey, dear.”
Audrey did not stir.
“Mon Dieu!“ murmured Madame Piriac, “What has

she, little one?”
Rosamund said stiffly and curtly:
“She is asleep.... It is very late. Four o’clock.”
Excellent as was Audrey’s excuse for her lapse, Rosamund

was not at all pleased. That slumber was one of

Rosamund’s rare defeats.

CHAPTER XII
WIDOWHOOD IN THE STUDIO
Audrey was in a white piqué coat and short skirt, with

pale blue blouse and pale blue hat—and at the extremity

blue stockings and white tennis shoes. She picked up a

tennis racket in its press, and prepared to leave the studio.

She had bought the coat, the skirt, the blouse, the hat, the

tennis shoes, the racket, the press, and practically all she

wore, visible and invisible, at that very convenient and immense

shop, the Bon Marché, whose only drawback was

that it was always full. Everybody in the Quarter, except

a few dolls not in earnest, bought everything at the Bon

Marché, because the Bon Marché was so comprehensive and

so reliable. If you desired a toothbrush, the Bon Marché

not only supplied it, but delivered it in a 30-h.p. motor-van

manned by two officials in uniform. And if you desired a

bedroom suite, a pair of corsets, a box of pastels, an anthracite

stove, or a new wallpaper, the Bon Marché would never

shake its head.
And Audrey was now of the Quarter. Many simple

sojourners in the Quarter tried to imply the Latin Quarter

when they said the Quarter. But the Quarter was only the

Montparnasse Quarter. Nevertheless, it sufficed. It had

its own boulevards, restaurants, cafés, concerts, theatres,

palaces, shops, gardens, museums, and churches. There

was no need to leave it, and if you were a proper amateur

of the Quarter, you never did leave it save to scoff at other

Quarters. Sometimes you fringed the Latin Quarter in the

big cafés of the Boulevard St. Michel, and sometimes you

strolled northwards as far as the Seine, and occasionally

even crossed the Seine in order to enter the Louvre, which

lined the other bank, but you did not go any farther. Why

should you?
Audrey had become so acclimatised to the Quarter that

Miss Nickall’s studio seemed her natural home. It was very

typically a woman’s studio of the Quarter. About thirty feet

each way and fourteen feet high, with certain irregularities

of shape, it was divided into corners. There were the two

bed-corners, which were lounge-corners during the day; the

afternoon-tea corner, with a piece or two of antique furniture

and some old silk hangings, where on high afternoons

tea was given to droves of visitors; and there was the culinary

corner, with spirit-lamps, gas-rings, kettles, and a bowl

or two over which you might spend a couple of arduous hours

in ineffectually whipping up a mayonnaise for an impromptu

lunch. Artistic operations were carried out in the middle of

the studio, not too far from the stove, which never went out

from November to May. A large mirror hung paramount

on one wall. The remaining spaces of the studio were filled

with old easels, canvases, old frames, old costumes and

multifarious other properties for pictures, trunks, lamps,

boards, tables, and bric-à-brac bought at the Ham-and-Old-Iron

Fair. There were a million objects in the studio, and

their situations had to be, and were, learnt off by heart.

The scene of the toilette was a small attached chamber.
The housekeeping combined the simplicity of the early

Christians with the efficient organising of the twentieth century.

It began at about half-past seven, when unseen but

heard beings left fresh rolls and the New York Herald or

the Daily Mail at the studio door. You made your own bed,

just as you cleaned your own boots or washed your own face.

The larder consisted of tins of coffee, tea, sugar, and cakes,

with an intermittent supply of butter and lemons. The infusing

of tea and coffee was practised in perfection. It

mattered not in the least whether toilette or breakfast came

first, but it was exceedingly important that the care of the

stove should precede both. Between ten and eleven the concierge’s

wife arrived with tools and utensils; she swept and

dusted under a considerable percentage of the million objects—and

the responsibilities of housekeeping were finished until

the next day, for afternoon tea, if it occurred, was a diversion

and not a toil.
A great expanse of twelve to fifteen hours lay in front

of you. It was not uncomfortably and unchangeably cut

into fixed portions by the incidence of lunch and dinner.

You ate when you felt inclined to eat, and nearly always at

restaurants where you met your acquaintances. Meals were

the least important happenings of the day. You had no

reliable watch, and you needed none, for you had no fixed

programme. You worked till you had had enough of work.

You went forth into the world exactly when the idea took

you. If you were bored, you found a friend and went to

sit in a café. You were ready for anything. The word

“rule” had been omitted from your dictionary. You retired

to bed when the still small voice within murmured

that there was naught else to do. You woke up in the

morning amid cups and saucers, lingerie, masterpieces, and

boots. And the next day was the same. All the days were

the same. Weeks passed with inexpressible rapidity, and

all things beyond the Quarter had the quality of vague

murmurings and noises behind the scenes.
May had come. Audrey and Miss Ingate had lived in

the studio for six months before they realised that they had

settled down there and that habits had been formed. Still,

they had accomplished something. Miss Ingate had gone

back into oils and was attending life classes, and Audrey,

by terrible application and by sitting daily at the feet of an

oldish lady in black, and by refusing to speak English between

breakfast and dinner, had acquired a good accent and

much fluency in the French tongue. Now, when she spoke

French, she thought in French, and she was extremely proud

of the achievement. Also she was acquainted with the names

and styles of all known modern painters from pointillistes to

cubistes, and, indeed, with the latest eccentricities in all the

arts. She could tell who was immortal, and she was fully

aware that there was no real painting in England. In brief,

she was perhaps more Parisian even than she had hoped. She

had absorbed Paris into her system. It was still not the Paris

of her early fancy; in particular, it lacked elegance; but it

richly satisfied her.
She had on this afternoon of young May an appointment

with a young man. And the appointment seemed quite

natural, causing no inward disturbance. Less than ever could

she understand her father’s ukases against young men and

against every form of self-indulgence. Now, when she had

the idea of doing a thing, she merely did it. Her instincts

were her only guide, and, though her instincts were often

highly complex, they seldom puzzled her. The old instinct

that the desire to do a thing was a sufficient reason against

doing it, had expired. For many weeks she had lived with

a secret fear that such unbridled conduct must lead to terrible

catastrophes, but as nothing happened this fear also

expired. She was constantly with young men, and often with

men not young; she liked it, but just as much she liked being

with women. She never had any difficulties with men. Miss

Thompkins insinuated at intervals that she flirted, but she

had the sharpest contempt for flirtation, and as a practice

put it on a level with embezzlement or arson. Miss Thompkins,

however, kept on insinuating. Audrey regarded herself

as decidedly wiser than Miss Thompkins. Her opinions

on vital matters changed almost weekly, but she was always

absolutely sure that the new opinion was final and incontrovertible.

Her scorn of the old English Audrey, though concealed,

was terrific.
And it is to be remembered that she was a widow. She was

never half a second late, now, in replying when addressed

as “Mrs. Moncreiff.” Frequently she thought that she in

fact was a widow. Widowhood was a very advantageous

state. It had a free pass to all affairs of interest. It opened

wide the door of the world. It recked nothing of girlish

codes. It abolished discussions concerning conventional propriety.

Its chief defect, for Audrey, was that if she met

another widow, or even a married woman, she had to take

heed lest she stumbled. Fortunately, neither widows nor

wives were very prevalent in the Quarter. And Audrey had

attained skill in the use of the state of widowhood. She told

no more infantile perilous tales about husbands who ate peas

with a knife. In her thankfulness that the tyrannic Rosamund

had gone to Germany, and that Madame Piriac had

vanished back into unknown Paris, Audrey was at pains to

take to heart the lesson of a semi-hysterical blunder.
She descended the dark, dusty oak stairs utterly content.

And at the door of the gloomy den of the concierge the concierge’s

wife was standing. She was a new wife, the young

mate of a middle-aged husband, and she had only been illuminating

the den (which was kitchen, parlour, and bedroom

in a space of ten feet by eight) for about a month. She was

plump and pretty, and also she was fair, which was unusual

for a Frenchwoman. She wore a striped frock and a little

black apron, and her yellow hair was waved with art. Audrey

offered her the key of the studio with a smile, and, as Audrey

expected, the concierge’s wife began to chatter. The concierge’s

wife loved to chatter with Anglo-Saxon tenants, and

she specially enjoyed chattering with Audrey, because of the

superior quality of Audrey’s French and of her tips. Audrey

listened, proud because she could understand so well and

answer so fluently.
The sun, which in May shone on the courtyard for about

forty minutes in the afternoon on clear days, caught these

two creatures in the same beam. They made a delicious

sight—Audrey dark, with her large forehead and negligible

nose, and the concierge’s wife rather doll-like in the regularity

of her features. They were delicious not only because

of their varied charm, but because they were so absurdly

wise and omniscient, and because they had come to settled

conclusions about every kind of worldly problem. Youth and

vitality equalised their ranks, and the fact that Audrey possessed

many ascertained ancestors, and a part of the earth’s

surface, and much money, and that the concierge’s wife possessed

nothing but herself and a few bits of furniture, was

not of the slightest importance.
The concierge’s wife, after curiosity concerning tennis,

grew confidential about herself, and more confidential. And

at last she lowered her tones, and with sparkling eyes

communicated information to Audrey in a voice that was

little more than a whisper.
“Oh! truly? I must go,” hastily said Audrey, blushing,

and off she ran, reduced in an instant to the schoolgirl.

Her departure was a retreat. These occasional discomfitures

made a faint blot on the excellence of being a

widow.

CHAPTER XIII
THE SWOON
In the north-east corner of the Luxembourg Gardens,

where the lawn-tennis courts were permitted by a public

authority which was strangely impartial and cosmopolitan

in the matter of games, Miss Ingate sat sketching a group

of statuary with the Rue de Vaugirard behind it. She

was sketching in the orthodox way, on the orthodox stool,

with the orthodox combined paint-box and easel, and the

orthodox police permit in the cover of the box.
The bright and warm weather was tonic; it accounted

for the whole temperament of Parisians. Under such a

sky, with such a delicate pricking vitalisation in the air,

it was impossible not to be Parisian. The trees, all

arranged in beautiful perspectives, were coming into leaf,

and through their screens could be seen everywhere children

shouting as they played at ball and top, and both kinds

of nurses, and scores of perambulators and mothers, and

a few couples dallying with their sensations, and old men

reading papers, and old women knitting and relating

anecdotes or entire histories. And nobody was curious

beyond his own group. The people were perfectly at home

in this grandiose setting of gardens and fountains and

grey palaces, with theatres, boulevards and the odour and

roar of motor-buses just beyond the palisades. And Miss

Ingate in the exciting sunshine gazed around with her

subdued Essex grin, as if saying: “It’s the most topsy-turvy

planet that I was ever on, and why am I, of all

people, trying to make this canvas look like a piece of

sculpture and a street?”
“Now, Miss Ingate,” said tall red-haired Tommy, who

was standing over her. “Before you go any farther, do

look at the line of roofs and see how interesting it is;

it’s really full of interest. And you’ve simply not got on

speaking terms with it yet.”
“No more I have! No more I have!” cried Miss

Ingate, glancing round at Audrey, who was swinging her

racket. “Thank you, Tommy. I ought to have thought

of it for my own sake, because roofs are so much

easier than statues, and I must get an effect somewhere,

mustn’t I?”
Tommy winked at Audrey. But Tommy’s wink was

as naught to the great invisible wink of Miss Ingate,

the everlasting wink that derided the universe and the sun

himself.
Then Musa appeared, with paraphernalia, at the end

of a path. Accompanying him was a specimen of the

creature known on tennis lawns as “a fourth.” He was

almost nameless, tall, very young, with the seedlings of

a moustache and a space of nude calf between his knickerbockers

and his socks. He was very ceremonious, shy,

ungainly and blushful. He played a fair-to-middling game;

and nothing more need be said of him.
Musa by contrast was an accomplished man of the

world, and the fact that the fourth obviously regarded

him as a hero helped Musa to behave in a manner satisfactory

to himself in front of these English and American

women, so strange, so exotic, so kind, and so disconcerting.

Musa looked upon Britain as a romantic isle where people

died for love. And as for America, in his mind it was

as sinister, as wondrous, and as fatal as the Indies might

seem to a bank clerk in Bradford. He had need of every

moral assistance in this or any other social ordeal. For,

though he was still the greatest violinist in Paris, and

perhaps in the world, he could not yet prove this profound

truth by the only demonstration which the world

accepts.
If he played in studios he was idolised. If he played

at small concerts in unknown halls he was received with

rapture. But he was never lionised. The great concert

halls never saw him on their platforms; his name was

never in the newspapers; and hospitable personages never

fought together for his presence at their tables, even if

occasionally they invited him to perform for charity in

return for a glass of claret and a sandwich. Monsieur

Dauphin had attempted to force the invisible barriers for

him, but without success. All his admirers in the Quarter

stuck to it that he was in the rank of Kreisler and Ysaye;

at the same time they were annoyed with him inasmuch

as he did not force the world to acknowledge the prophetic

good taste of the Quarter. And Musa made mistakes.

He ought to have arrived at studios in a magnificent

automobile, and to have given superb and uproarious

repasts, and to have rendered innumerable women exquisitely

unhappy. Whereas he arrived by tube or bus, never

offered hospitality of any sort, and was like a cat with

women. Hence the attitude of the Quarter was patronising,

as if the Quarter had said: “Yes, he is the greatest

violinist in Paris and perhaps in the world; but that’s all,

and it isn’t enough.”
The young man and the boy made ready for the game

as for a gladiatorial display. Their frowning seriousness

proved that they had comprehended the true British idea

of sport. Musa came round the net to Audrey’s side, but

Audrey said in French:
“Miss Thompkins and I will play together. See, we

are going to beat you and Gustave.”
Musa retired. A few indifferent spectators had collected.

Gustave, the fourth, had to serve.
“Play!” he muttered, in a thick and threatening voice,

whose depth was the measure of his nervousness.
He served a double fault to Tommy, and then a fault

to Audrey. The fourth ball he got over. Audrey played it.

The two males rushed with appalling force together on

the centre line in pursuit, and a terrible collision occurred.

Musa fell away from Gustave as from a wall. When he

arose out of the pebbly dust his right arm hung very

limp from the shoulder. No sooner had he risen than he

sank again, and the blood began to leave his face, and

his eyes closed. The fourth, having recovered from the

collision, knelt down by his side, and gazed earnestly at

him. Tommy and Audrey hurried towards the statuesque

group, and Audrey was thinking: “Why did I refuse to

let him play with me? If he had played with me there

would have been no accident.” She reproached herself

because she well knew that only out of the most absurd

contrariness had she repulsed Musa. Or was it that she

had repulsed him from fear of something that Tommy

might say or look?
In a few seconds, strongly drawn by this marvellous

piece of luck, promenaders were darting with joyous rapidity

from north, south, east and west to witness the tragedy.

There were nurses with coloured streamers six feet long,

lusty children, errand boys, lads, and sundry nondescript

men, some of whom carefully folded up their newspapers

as they hurried to the cynosure. They beheld the body

as though it were a corpse, and the corpse of an enemy;

they formulated and discussed theories of the event; they

examined minutely the rackets which had been thrown on

the ground. They were exercising the immemorial rights

of unmoved curiosity; they held themselves as indifferent

as gods, and the murmur of their impartial voices floated

soothingly over Musa, and the shadow of their active

profiles covered him from the sparkling sunshine. Somebody

mentioned policemen, in the plural, but none came.

All remarked in turn that the ladies were English, as

though that were a sufficient explanation of the whole

affair.
No one said:
“It is Musa, the greatest violinist in Paris and perhaps

in Europe.”
Desperately Audrey stooped and seized Musa beneath

the armpits to lift him to a sitting position.
“You’d better leave him alone,” said Tommy, with a

kind of ironic warning and innuendo.
But Audrey still struggled with the mass, convinced that

she was showing initiative and firmness of character. The

fourth with fierce vigour began to aid her, and another

youth from the crowd was joining the enterprise when

Miss Ingate arrived from her stool.
“Drop him, you silly little thing!” adjured Miss

Ingate. “Instead of lifting his head you ought to lift

his feet.”
Audrey stared uncertain for a moment, and then let

the mass subside. Whereupon Miss Ingate with all her

strength lifted both legs to the height of her waist, giving

Musa the appearance of a wheelless barrow.
“You want to let the blood run into his head,” said

Miss Ingate with a self-conscious grin at the increasing

crowd. “People only faint because the blood leaves their

heads—that’s why they go pale.”
Musa’s cheeks showed a tinge of red. You could almost

see the precious blood being decanted by Miss Ingate out

of the man’s feet into his head. In a minute he opened

his eyes. Miss Ingate lowered the legs.
“It was only the pain that made him feel queer,” she

said.
The episode was over, and the crowd very gradually

and reluctantly scattered, disappointed at the lack of a

fatal conclusion. Musa stood up, smiling apologetically,

and Audrey supported him by the left arm, for the right

could not be touched.
“Hadn’t you better take him home, Mrs. Moncreiff?”

Tommy suggested. “You can get a taxi here in the

Rue de Vaugirard.” She did not smile, but her green

eyes glinted.
“Yes, I will,” said Audrey curtly.
And Tommy’s eyes glinted still more.
“And I shall get a doctor,” said Audrey. “His arm

may be broken.”
“I should,” Tommy concurred with gravity.
“Well, if it is, I can’t set it,” said Miss Ingate

quizzically. “I was getting on so well with the high

lights on that statue. I’ll come along back to the studio

in about half an hour.”
The fourth, who had been hovering near like a criminal

magnetised by his crime, bounded off furiously at the

suggestion that he should stop a taxi at the entrance to

the gardens.
“I hope he has broken his arm and he can never play

any more,” thought Audrey, astoundingly, as she and

the fourth helped pale Musa into the open taxi. “It will

just serve those two right.” She meant Miss Ingate and

Tommy.
No sooner did the taxi start than Musa began to cry.

He did not seem to care that he was in the midst of a

busy street, with a piquant widow by his side.

CHAPTER XIV
MISS INGATE POINTS OUT THE DOOR
“Why did you cry this afternoon, Musa?”
Musa made no reply.
Audrey was lighting the big lamp in the Moncreiff-Ingate

studio. It made exactly the same moon as it had

made on the night in the previous autumn when Audrey

had first seen it. She had brought Musa to the studio

because she did not care to take him to his own lodgings.

(As a fact, nobody that she knew, except Musa, had ever

seen Musa’s lodgings.) This was almost the first moment

they had had to themselves since the visit of the little

American doctor from the Rue Servandoni. The rumour

of Musa’s misfortune had spread through the Quarter like

the smell of a fire, and various persons of both sexes

had called to inspect, to sympathise, and to take tea,

which Audrey was continually making throughout the late

afternoon. Musa had had an egg for his tea, and more

than one girl had helped to spread the yolk and the

white on pieces of bread-and-butter, for the victim of

destiny had his right arm in a sling. Audrey had let

them do it, as a mother patronisingly lets her friends

amuse her baby.
In the end they had all gone; Tommy had enigmatically

looked in and gone, and Miss Ingate had gone to dine at

the favourite restaurant of the hour in the Rue Léopold

Robert. Audrey had refused to go, asserting that which

was not true; namely, that she had had an enormous

tea, including far too many petits fours. Miss Ingate in

departing had given a glance at her sketch (fixed on the

easel), and another at Audrey, and another at Musa, all

equally ironic and kindly.
Musa also had declined dinner, but he had done nothing

to indicate that he meant to leave. He sat mournful and

passive in a basket chair, his sling making a patch of

white in the gloom. The truth was that he suffered from

a disability not uncommon among certain natures: he did

not know how to go. He could arrive with ease, but he

was no expert at vanishing. Audrey was troubled. As

suited her age and condition, she was apt to feel the

responsibility of the whole universe. She knew that she

was responsible for Musa’s accident, and now she was

beginning to be aware that she was responsible for his

future as well. She was sure that he needed encouragement

and guidance. She pictured him with his fiddle under

his chin, masterful, confident, miraculous, throwing a spell

over everyone within earshot. But actually she saw him

listless and vanquished in the basket chair, and she

perceived that only a strongly influential and determined

woman, such as herself, could save him from disaster.

No man could do it. His tears had shaken her. She was

willing to make allowances for a foreigner, but she had

never seen a man cry before, and the spectacle was very

disturbing. It inspired her with a fear that even she

could not be the salvation of Musa.
“I demanded something of you,” she said, after lowering

the wick of the lamp to exactly the right point, and

staring at it for a greater length of time than was

necessary or even seemly. She spoke French, and as she

listened to her French accent she heard that it was good.
“I am done for!” came the mournful voice of Musa

out of the obscurity behind the lamp.
“What! You are done for? But you know what the

doctor said. He said no bone was broken. Only a little

strain, and the pain from your——” Admirable though

her French accent was, she could not think of the French

word for “funny-bone.” Indeed she had never learnt it.

So she said it in English. Musa knew not what she

meant, and thus a slight chasm was opened between them

which neither could bridge. She finished: “In one week

you are going to be able to play again.”
Musa shook his head.
Relieved as she was to discover that Musa had cried

because he was done for, and not because he was hurt,

she was still worried by his want of elasticity, of resiliency.

Nevertheless she was agreeably worried. The doctor had

disappointed her by his light optimism, but he could not

smile away Musa’s moral indisposition. The large vagueness

of the studio, the very faint twilight still showing

through the great window, the silence and intimacy, the

sounds of the French language, the gleam of the white

sling, all combined to permeate her with delicious melancholy.

And not for everlasting bliss would she have had Musa

strong, obstinate, and certain of success.
“A week!” he murmured. “It is for ever. A week

of practice lost is eternally lost. And on Wednesday one

had invited me to play at Foa’s. And I cannot.”
“Foa? Who is Foa?”
“What! You do not know Foa? In order to succeed

it is necessary, it is essential, to play at Foa’s. That

alone gives the cachet. Dauphin told me last week. He

arranged it. After having played at Foa’s all is possible.

Dauphin was about to abandon me when he met Foa.

Now I am ruined. This afternoon after the tennis I was

going to Durand’s to get the new Caprice of Roussel—he

is an intimate friend of Foa. I should have studied

it in five days. They would have been ravished by the

attention .... But why talk I thus? No, I could not

have played Caprice to please them. I am cursed. I will

never again touch the violin, I swear it. What am I?

Do I not live on the money lent to me regularly by

Mademoiselle Thompkins and Mademoiselle Nickall?”
“You don’t, Musa?” Audrey burst out in English.
“Yes, yes!” said Musa violently. “But last month,

from Mademoiselle Nickall—nothing! She is in London;

she forgets. It is better like that. Soon I shall be

playing in the Opéra orchestra, fourth desk, one hundred

francs a month. That will be the end. There can be

no other.”
Instead of admiring the secret charity of Tommy and

Nick, which she had never suspected, Audrey was very

annoyed by it. She detested it and resented it. And

especially the charity of Miss Thompkins. She considered

that from a woman with eyes and innuendoes like Tommy’s

charity amounted to a sneer.
“It is extremely unsatisfactory,” she said, dropping on

to Miss Ingate’s sofa.
Not another word was spoken. Audrey tapped her foot.

Musa creaked in the basket chair. He avoided her eyes,

but occasionally she glared at him like a schoolmistress.

Then her gaze softened—he looked so ill, so helpless, so

hopeless. She wanted to light a cigarette for him, but she

was somehow bound to the sofa. She wanted him

to go—she hated the prospect of his going. He could not

possibly go, alone, to his solitary room. Who would

tend him, soothe him, put him to bed? He was an

infant....
Then, after a long while, Miss Ingate entered sharply.

Audrey coughed and sprang up.
“Oh!” ejaculated Miss Ingate.
“I—I think I shall just change my boots,” said Audrey,

smoothing out the short white skirt. And she disappeared

into the dressing-room that gave on to the studio.
As soon as she was gone, Miss Ingate went close up

to Musa’s chair. He had not moved.
She said, smiling, with the corners of her mouth well

down:
“Do you see that door, young man?”
And she indicated the door.
When Audrey came back into the studio.
“Audrey,” cried Miss Ingate shrilly. “What you been

doing to Musa? As soon as you went out he up vehy

quickly and ran away.”
At this information Audrey was more obviously troubled

and dashed than Miss Ingate had ever seen her, in Paris.

She made no answer at all. Fortunately, lying on the table

in front of the mirror was a letter for Miss Ingate which had

arrived by the evening post. Audrey went for it, pretending

to search, and then handed it over with a casual gesture.
“It looks as if it was from Nick,” she murmured.
Miss Ingate, as she was putting on her spectacles,

remarked:
“I hope you weren’t hurt—me not coming with you and

Musa in the taxi from the gardens this afternoon, dear.”
“Me? Oh no!”
“It wasn’t that I was so vehy interested in my sketch.

But to my mind there’s nothing more ridiculous than

several women all looking after one man. Miss Thompkins

thought so, too.”
“Oh! Did she?... What does Nick say?”
Miss Ingate had put the letter flat on the table in the full

glare of the lamp, and was leaning over it, her grey hair

brilliantly illuminated. Audrey kept in the shadow and in

the distance. Miss Ingate had a habit of reading to herself

under her breath. She read slowly, and turned pages over

with a deliberate movement.
“Well,” said Miss Ingate twisting her head sideways so

as to see Audrey standing like a ghost afar off. “Well, she

has been going it! She’s broken a window in Oxford

Street with a hammer; she had one night in the cells for

that. And she’d have had to go to prison altogether only

some unknown body paid the fine for her. She says:

’There are some mean persons in the world, and he was

one. I feel sure it was a man, and an American, too.

The owners of the shops are going to bring a law action

against me for the value of the plate-glass. It is such fun.

And our leaders are splendid and so in earnest. They say

we are doing a great historical work, and we are. The

London correspondent of the New York Times interviewed

me because I am American. I did not want to be interviewed,

but our instructions are—never to avoid publicity.

There is to be no more window breaking for the present.

Something new is being arranged. The hammer is so

heavy, and sometimes the first blow does not break the

window. The situation is very serious, and the Government

is at its wits’ end. This we know. We have our

agents everywhere. All the most thoughtful people are

strongly in favour of votes for women; but of course some

of them are afraid of our methods. This only shows that

they have not learnt the lessons of history. I wonder that

you and dear Mrs. Moncreiff do not come and help. Many

women ask after you, and everybody at Kingsway is very

curious to know Mrs. Moncreiff. Since Mrs. Burke’s

death, Betty has taken rooms in this house, but perhaps

Tommy has told you this already. If so, excuse. Betty’s

health is very bad since they let her out last. With regard

to the rent, will you pay the next quarter direct to the

concierge yourselves? It will save so much trouble. I

must tell you——’”
Slowly Audrey moved up to the table and leaned over the

letter by Miss Ingate’s side.
“So you see!” said Miss Ingate. “Well, we must

show it to Tommy in the morning. ‘Not learnt the lessons

of history,’ eh? I know who’s been talking to Nick. I

know as well as if I could hear them speaking.”
“Do you think we ought to go to London?” Audrey

demanded bluntly.
“Well,” Miss Ingate answered, with impartial irony on

her long upper lip. “I don’t know. Of course I played the

organ all the way down Regent Street. I feel very strongly

about votes for women, and once when I was helping in the

night and day vigil at the House of Commons and some

Ministers came out smoking their cigahs and asked us how

we liked it, I was vehy, vehy angry. However, the next

morning I had a cigarette myself and felt better. But I’m

not a professional reformer, like a lot of them are at Kingsway.

It isn’t my meat and drink. And I don’t think it

matters much whether we get the vote next year or in ten

years. I’m Winifred Ingate before I’m anything else. And

so long as I’m pretty comfortable no one’s going to make

me believe that the world’s coming to an end. I know one

thing—if we did get the vote it would take me all my time

to keep most of the women I know from, voting for something

silly.”
“Winnie,” said Audrey. “You’re very sensible sometimes.”
“I’m always very sensible,” Winnie retorted, “until I

get nervous. Then I’m apt to skid.”
Without more words they transformed the studio, by a

few magical strokes, from a drawing-room into a bedroom.

Audrey, the last to retire, extinguished the lamp, and

tripped to her bed behind her screen. Only a few slight

movements disturbed the silence.
“Winnie,” said Audrey suddenly. “I do believe you’re

one of those awful people who compromise. You’re always

right in the middle of the raft.”
But Miss Ingate, being fast asleep, offered no answer.

CHAPTER XV
THE RIGHT BANK
The next day, after a studio lunch which contained too

much starch and was deficient in nitrogen, Miss Ingate,

putting on her hat and jacket, said with a caustic gesture:
“Well, I must be off to my life class. And much good

may it do me!”
The astonishing creature had apparently begun existence

again, and begun it on the plane of art, but this did not prevent

the observer within her from taking the same attitude

towards her second career as she had taken towards her first.

Nothing seemed more meet for Miss Ingate’s ironic contemplation

than the daily struggle for style and beauty in

the academies of the Quarter.
Audrey made no reply. The morning had been unusually

silent, giving considerable scope for Miss Ingate’s faculty

for leaving well alone.
“I suppose you aren’t coming out?” added Miss Ingate.
“No. I went out a bit this morning. You know I have

my French lesson in twenty minutes.”
“Of course.”
Miss Ingate seized her apparatus and departed. The

instant she was alone Audrey began in haste to change into

all her best clothes, which were black, and which the

Quarter seldom saw. Fashionably arrayed, she sat down

and wrote a note to Madame Schmitt, her French instructress,

to say that she had been suddenly called away on

urgent business, and asking her nevertheless to count the

time as a lesson given. This done, she put her credit notes

and her cheque-book into her handbag, and, leaving the note

with the concierge’s wife, who bristled with interesting

suspicions, she vanished into Paris.
The weather was even more superb than on the previous

day. Paris glittered around her as she drove, slowly, in a

horse-taxi, to the Place de l’Opéra on the right bank,

where the grand boulevard meets the Avenue de l’Opéra and

the Rue de la Paix. Here was the very centre of the

fashionable and pleasure-ridden district which the Quarter

held in noble scorn. She had seen it before, because she had

started a banking account (under advice from Mr. Foulger),

and the establishment of her bankers was situate at the

corner of the Avenue de l’Opéra and the Rue de la Paix.

But she knew little of the district, and such trifling information

as she had acquired was tinged by the natural hostility

of a young woman who for over six months, with no compulsion

to do so, had toiled regularly and fiercely in the

pursuit of knowledge. She paid off the cab, and went to

test the soundness of her bankers. The place was full of

tourists, and in one department of it young men in cages,

who knew not the Quarter, were counting, and ladling, and

pinning together, and engorging, and dealing forth, the

currency and notes of all the great nations of the earth.

The spectacle was inspiring.
In half a year the restive but finally obedient Mr. Foulger

had sent three thousand pounds to Paris in the unpoetic

form of small oblong pieces of paper signed with his own

dull signature. Audrey desired to experience the thrill of

authentic money. She waited some time in front of a cage,

with her cheque-book open on the counter, until a young

man glanced at her interrogatively through the bars.
“How much money have I got here, please?” she asked.

She ought to have said: “What is my balance, please?”

But nobody had taught her the sacred formula.
“What name?” said the clerk.
“Moze—Audrey Moze,” she answered, for she had not

dared to acquaint Mr. Foulger with her widowhood, and his

cheques were made out to herself.
The clerk vanished, and in a moment reappeared,

silently wrote something on a little form, and pushed it to

her under the grille. She read:
/*

“73,065 frs. 50c.”

*/
The fact was that in six months she had spent little more

than the amount which she had brought with her from

London. Having begun in simplicity, in simplicity she had

continued, partly because she had been too industrious and

too earnest for luxurious caprices, partly because she had

never been accustomed to anything else but simplicity, and

partly from wilfulness. It had pleased her to think that she

was piling tens of thousands upon tens of thousands—in

francs.
But in the night she had decided that the moment had

arrived for a change in the great campaign of seeing life

and tasting it.
She timorously drew a cheque for eleven thousand

francs, and asked for ten thousand in notes and a thousand

in gold. The clerk showed no trace of either astonishment

or alarm; but he insisted on her endorsing the cheque.

When she saw the gold, she changed half of it for ten notes

of fifty francs each.
Emerging with false but fairly plausible nonchalance

from the crowded establishment, where other clerks were

selling tickets to Palestine, Timbuctoo, Bagdad, Berlin, and

all the abodes of happiness in the world, she saw at the

newspaper kiosk opposite the little blue poster of an

English daily. It said: “More Suffragette Riots.” She

had a qualm, for her conscience was apt to be tyrannic, and

its empire over her had been strengthened by the long,

steady course of hard work which she had accomplished.

Miss Ingate’s arguments had not placated that conscience.

It had said to her in the night: “If ever there was a girl

who ought to assist heartily in the emancipation of women,

that girl is you, Audrey Moze.”
“Pooh!” she replied to her conscience, for she could

always confute it with a sharp word—for a time.
And she crossed to the grand boulevard, and turned

westward along the splendid, humming, roaring thoroughfare

gay with flags and gleaming with such plate-glass as

Nick the militant would have loved to shatter. Certainly

there was nothing like this street in the Quarter. The

Quarter could equal it neither in shops, nor in cafés, nor in

vehicles, nor in crowds. It was an exultant thoroughfare,

and Audrey caught its buoyancy, which could be distinctly

seen in the feather on her hat. At the end of it she passed

into the cool shade of a music-shop with the name

“Durand” on its façade. She had found the address, and

another one, in the telephone book at the Café de Versailles

that morning. It was an immense shop containing millions

of pieces of music for all instruments and all tastes. Yet

when she modestly asked for the Caprice for violin of

Roussel, the morceau was brought to her without the slightest

hesitation, together with the pianoforte accompaniment.

The price was twelve francs.
Her gloved hand closed round the slim roll with the

delicate firmness which was actuating all her proceedings on

that magnificent afternoon. She was determined to save

Musa not merely from himself, but from Miss Thompkins

and everybody. It was not that she was specially interested

in Musa. No! She was interested in a clean, neat job—that

was all. She had begun to take charge of Musa, and

she intended to carry the affair through. He had the ability

to succeed, and he should succeed. It would be ridiculous

for him not to succeed. From certain hints, and from a

deeply sagacious instinct, she had divined that money and

management were the only ingredients lacking to Musa’s

triumph. She could supply both these elements; and she

would. And her reward would be the pride of the workman

in his job.
Now her firmness hesitated. She retraced the boulevard

to the Place de l’Opéra, and then took the Rue de la Paix.

In the first shop on the left-hand side, next to her bankers,

she saw amid a dazzling collection of jewelled articles for

travellers and letter-writers and diary-keepers, a sublime

gold handbag, or, as the French say, hand-sack. Its clasp

was set with a sapphire. Impulse sent her gliding right

into the shop, with the words already on her lips: “How

much is that gold hand-sack in the window?” But when

she reached the hushed and shadowed interior, which was

furnished like a drawing-room with soft carpets and

tapestried chairs, she beheld dozens of gold hand-sacks

glinting like secret treasure in a cave; and she was

embarrassed by the number and variety of them. A well-dressed

and affable lady and gentleman, with a quite remarkable

similarity of prominent noses, welcomed her in general

terms, and seemed surprised, and even a little pained, when

she talked about buying and selling. She came out of the

shop with a gold hand-sack which had cost twelve hundred

francs, and all her money was in it.
Fortified by the impressive bauble, she walked along the

street to the Place Vendôme, where she descried in the distance

the glittering signs and arms of the Hôtel du Danube.

Then she walked up the opposite pavement of the Rue de la

Paix, and down again and up again until she had grasped

its significance.
It was a street of jewellery, perfumes, antiques, gloves,

hats, frocks, and furs. It was a street wherein the lily was

painted and gold was gilded. Every window was a miracle

of taste, refinement, and costliness. Every article in every

window was so dear that no article was ticketed with its

price, save a few wafer-like watches and jewelled rings that

bore tiny figures, such as 12,500 francs, 40,000 francs.

Despite her wealth, Audrey felt poor. The upper windows

of nearly all the great buildings were arrayed with plants

in full bloom. The roadway was covered with superb

automobiles, some of them nearly as long as trains. About

half of them stood in repose at the kerb, and Audrey as she

strolled could see through their panes of bevelled glass the

complex luxury within of toy dogs, clocks, writing-pads,

mirrors, powder boxes, parasols, and the lounging arrogance

of uniformed menials. At close intervals women passed

rapidly across the pavements to or from these automobiles.

If they were leaving a shop, the automobile sprang into life,

dogs, menials, and all, the door was opened, the woman

slipped in like a mechanical toy, the door banged, the

menial jumped, and with trumpet tones the entire machine

curved and swept away. The aspect of these women made

Audrey feel glad that she was wearing her best clothes, and

simultaneously made her feel that her best clothes were worse

than useless.
She saw an automobile shop with a card at the door:

“Town and touring cars for hire by day, week, or month.”

A gorgeous Mercédès, too spick, too span, altogether too

celestial for earthly use, occupied most of the shop.
“Good afternoon, Madame,” said a man in bad English.

For Audrey had misguided herself into the emporium. She

did not care to be addressed in her own tongue; she even

objected to the instant discovery of her nationality, of which

at the moment she was ashamed. And so it was with

frigidity that she inquired whether cars were to be hired.
The shopman hesitated. Audrey knew that she had

committed an indiscretion. It was impossible that cars

should be handed out thus unceremoniously to anybody who

had the fancy to enter the shop! Cars were naturally the

subject of negotiations and references.... And then the

shopman, espying the gold bag, and being by it and by the

English frigidity humbled to his proper station, fawned and

replied that he had cars for hire, and the best cars. Did the

lady want a large car or a small car? She wanted a large

car. Did she want a town or a touring car? She wanted a

town car, and by the week. When did she want it? She

wanted it at once—in half an hour.
“I can hire you a car in half an hour, with liveried

chauffeur,” said the shopman, after telephoning. “But he

cannot speak English.”
“Ça m’est égal,” answered Audrey with grim satisfaction.

“What kind of a car will it be?”
“Mercédès, Madame.”
The price was eight hundred francs a week, inclusive.

As Audrey was paying for the first week the man murmured:
“What address, Madame?”
“Hôtel du Danube,” she answered like lightning—indeed

far quicker than thought. “But I shall call here for

the car. It must be waiting outside.”
The dispenser of cars bowed.
“Can you get a taxi for me?” Audrey suggested. “I

will leave this roll here and this bag,” producing her old

handbag which she had concealed under her coat. And she

thought: “All this is really very simple.”
At the other address which she had found in the

telephone book—a house in the Rue d’Aumale—she said to

an aged concierge:
“Monsieur Foa—which floor?”
A very dark, rather short and negligently dressed man

of nearly middle-age who was descending the staircase,

raised his hat with grave ceremony:
“Pardon, Madame. Foa—it is I.”
Audrey was not prepared for this encounter. She had

intended to compose her face and her speech while mounting

the staircase. She blushed.
“I come from Musa—the violinist,” she began hesitatingly.

“You invited him to play at your flat on Friday

night, Monsieur.”
Monsieur Foa gave a sudden enchanting smile:
“Yes, Madame. I hear much good of him from my

friend Dauphin, much good. And we long to hear him

play. It appears he is a great artist.”
“He has had an accident,” said Audrey. Monsier Foa’s

face grew serious. “It is nothing—a few days. The elbow—a

trifle. He cannot play next Friday. But he will be

desolated if he may not play to you later. He has so few

friends.... I came.... I....”
“Madame, every Friday we are at home, every Friday.

My wife will be ravished. I shall be ravished. Believe

me. Let him be reassured.”
“Monsieur, you are too amiable. I shall tell Musa.”
“Musa, he may have few friends—it is possible, Madame—but

he is nevertheless fortunate. Madame is English,

is it not so? My wife and I adore England and the

English. For us there is only England. If Madame would

do us the honour of coming when Musa plays.... My

wife will send an invitation, to the end of remaining within

the rules. You, Madame, and any of your friends.”
“Monsieur is too amiable, truly.”
In the end they were standing together on the pavement

by the waiting taxi. She gave him her card, and

breathed the words “Hôtel du Danube.” He was enchanted.

She offered her hand. He took it, raised it,

and kissed the back of it. Then he stood with his hat

off until she had passed from his sight.
Audrey was burning with excitement. She said to

herself:
“I have discovered Paris.”
When the taxi turned again into the Rue de la Paix,

she thought:
“The car will not be waiting. It would be too lovely

if it were.”
But there the car was, huge, glistening, unreal, incredible.

And a chauffeur gloved and liveried in brown,

to match the car, stood by its side, and the shopman

was at the door, holding the Caprice of Roussel and the

old handbag ready in his hand.
“Here is Madame,” said he.
The chauffeur saluted.
The car was closed.
“Will Madame have the carriage open or closed?”
“Closed.”
Having paid the taxi-driver, Audrey entered the car,

and as she did so, she threw over her shoulder:
“Hôtel du Danube.”
While the chauffeur started the engine, the shopman

with brilliant smiles delivered the music and the bag. The

door clicked. Audrey noticed the clock, the rug, the powder-box,

the speaking-tube, and the mirror. She gazed, and

saw a face triumphant and delicious in the mirror. The

car began to glide forward. She leaned back against the

pale grey upholstery, but in her soul she was standing

and crying with a wild wave of the hand, to the whole

street:
“It is a miracle!”
In a moment the gigantic car stopped in front of the

Hôtel du Danube. Two attendants rushed out in uniforms

of delicate blue. They did not touch their hats—they raised

them. Audrey descended and penetrated into the portico,

where a tall dandy saluted and inquired her will. She

wanted rooms; she wanted a flat? Certainly. They had

nothing but flats. A large flat on the ground-floor was at

her disposal absolutely. Two bedrooms, sitting-room,

bathroom. It had its own private entrance in the courtyard.

She inspected it. The suite was furnished in the

Empire style. Herself and maid? No. A friend! Well,

the maids could sleep upstairs. It could arrange itself. She

had no maid? Her friend had no maid? Ah! So much

the better. Sixty francs a day.
“Where is the dining-room?” demanded Audrey.
“Madame,” said the dandy, shocked. “We have no

dining-room. All meals are specially cooked to order and

served in the private rooms. We have the reputation....”

He opened his arms and bowed.
Good! Good! She would return with her friend in one

hour or so.
“106 Rue Delambre,” she bade the chauffeur, after being

followed to the pavement by the dandy and a suite.
“Rue de Londres?” said the chauffeur.
“No. Rue Delambre.”
It had to be looked out on the map, but the chauffeur,

trained to the hour, did not blench. However, when he

found the Rue Delambre, the success with which he

repudiated it was complete.
“Winnie!” began Audrey in the studio, with assumed

indifference. Miss Ingate was at tea.
“Oh! You are a swell. Where you been?”
“Winnie! What do you say to going and living on the

right bank for a bit?”
“Well, well!” said Miss Ingate. “So that’s it, is it?

I’ve been ready to go for a long time. Of course you want

to go first thing to-morrow morning. I know you.”
“No, I don’t,” said Audrey. “I want to go to-night.

Now! Pack the trunks quick. I’ve got the finest auto you

ever saw waiting at the door.”

CHAPTER XVI
ROBES
On the second following Friday evening, Audrey’s suite of

rooms at the Hôtel du Danube glowed in every corner with

pink-shaded electricity. According to what Audrey had

everywhere observed to be the French custom, there was in

this flat the minimum of corridor and the maximum of doors.

Each room communicated directly with all the other rooms.

The doors were open, and three women continually in a

feverish elation passed to and fro. Empire chairs and sofas

were covered with rich garments of every colour and form

and material, from the transparent blue silk matinée to the

dark heavy cloak of velvet ornamented with fur. The place

was in fact very like the showrooms of a cosmopolitan dressmaker

after a vast trying-on. Sundry cosmopolitan dressmakers

had contributed to the rich confusion. None had

hesitated for an instant to execute Audrey’s commands.

They had all been waiting, apparently since the beginning

of time, to serve her. All that district of Paris had been

thus waiting. The flat had been waiting, the automobile

had been waiting, the chauffeur had been waiting, and

purveyors of every sort. A word from her seemed to have

released them from an enchantment. For the most part

they were strange people, these magical attendants, never

mentioning money, but rather deprecating the sound of it,

and content to supply nothing but the finest productions of

their unquestionable genius. Still, Audrey reckoned that

she owed about twenty-five thousand francs to Paris.
The third woman was the maid, Elise. The hotel had

invented and delivered Elise, and thereafter seemed easier

in its mind. Elise was thirty years of age and not repellent

of aspect. On a black dress she wore the smallest white

muslin apron that either Audrey or Miss Ingate had ever

seen. She kept pins in her mouth, but in other respects

showed few eccentricities beyond an extreme excitability.

When at eight o’clock Mademoiselle’s new gown, promised

for seven, had not arrived, Elise begged permission to use

Madame’s salts. When the bell rang at eight-thirty, and a

lackey brought in an oval-shaped box with a long loop to it

of leathern strap, she only just managed not to kiss the

lackey. The rapid movement of Mademoiselle and Elise

with the contents of the box from the drawing-room into

Mademoiselle’s bedroom was the last rushing and swishing

that preceded a considerable peace.
Madame was absolutely ready, in her bedroom. In the

large mirror of the dark wardrobe she surveyed her

victoriously young face, the magnificent grey dress, the

coiffure, the jewels, the spangled shoes, the fan; and the

ensemble satisfied her. She was intensely and calmly happy.

No thought of the past nor of the future, nor of what was

going on in other parts of the earth’s surface could in the

slightest degree impair her happiness. She had done

nothing herself, she had neither earned money nor created

any of the objects which adorned her; nor was she capable

of doing the one or the other. Yet she felt proud as well as

happy, because she was young and superbly healthy, and not

unattractive. These were her high virtues. And her attitude

was so right that nobody would have disagreed with her.
Her left ear was listening for the sound, through the

unlatched window, of the arrival of the automobile with

Musa and his fiddle inside it.
Then the door leading from Mademoiselle’s bedroom

opened sharply, and Mademoiselle appeared, with her grey

hair, her pale shining forehead, her sardonic grin, and the

new dress of those Empire colours, magenta and green.

Elise stood behind, trembling with satisfaction.
“Well——” Audrey began. But she heard the automobile,

and told Elise to run and be ready to open the front

door of the flat.
“Rather showy, isn’t it? Rather daring?” said Miss

Ingate, advancing self-consciously and self-deprecating.
“Winnie,” answered Audrey. “It’s a nice question

between you and the Queen of Sheba.”
Suddenly Miss Ingate beheld in the mirror the masterpiece

of an illustrious male dressmaker-a masterpiece in

which no touch of the last fashion was abated-and little

Essex Winnie grinning from within it.
She screamed. And forthwith putting her hands behind

her neck she began to unhook the corsage.
“What are you doing, Winnie?”
“I’m taking it off.”
“But why?”
“Because I’m not going to wear it.”
“But you’ve nothing else to wear.”
“I can’t help that.”
“But you can’t come. What on earth shall you do?”
“I dare say I shall go to bed. Or I might shoot myself.

But if you think that I’m going outside this room in this

dress, you’re a perfect simpleton, Audrey. I don’t mind

being a fool, but I won’t look one.”
Audrey heard Musa enter the drawing-room.
She pulled the door to, keeping her hand on the knob.
“Very well, Winnie,” she said coldly, and swept into

the drawing-room.
As she and Musa left the pink rose-shaded flat, she heard

a burst of tears from Elise in the bedroom.
“21 Rue d’Aumale,” she curtly ordered the chauffeur,

who sat like a god obscurely in front of the illuminated

interior of the carriage. Musa’s violin case lay amid the

cushions therein.
The chauffeur approvingly touched his hat. The Rue

d’Aumale was a good street.
“I wonder what his surname is?” Audrey thought

curiously. “And whether he’s in love or married, and has

children.” She knew nothing of him save that his Christian

name was Michel.
She was taciturn and severe with Musa.

CHAPTER XVII
SOIRÉE
“Monsieur Foa—which floor?” Audrey asked once again

of the aged concierge in the Rue d’Aumale. This time she

got an answer. It was the fifth or top floor. Musa said

nothing, permitting himself to be taken about like a parcel,

though with a more graceful passivity. There was no lift,

but at each floor a cushioned seat for travellers to use and

a palm in a coloured pot in a niche for travellers to gaze

upon as they rested. The quality of the palms, however,

deteriorated floor by floor, and on the fourth and fifth floors

the niches were empty. A broad embroidered bell-pull,

twitched, gave rise to one clanging sound within the abode

of the Foas, and the clanging sound reacted upon a small

dog which yapped loudly and continued to yap until the

visitors had entered and the door been closed again.

Monsieur came out of a room into the small entrance-hall,

accompanied by a considerable noise of conversation. He

beamed his ravishment; he kissed hands; he helped with the

dark blue cloak.
“I brought Monsieur Musa in my car,” said Audrey.

“The weather——”
Monsieur Foa bowed low to Monsieur Musa, and

Monsieur Musa bowed low to Monsieur Foa.
“Monsieur!”
“Monsieur!”
“Monsieur, your accident I hope....”
And so on.
Cloak, overcoat, hat, stick—everything except the violin

case—were thrown pell-mell on to a piece of furniture in

the entrance-hall. Monsieur Foa, instead of being in evening

dress, was in exactly the same clothes as he had worn

at his first meeting with Audrey.
Madame Foa appeared in the doorway. She was a slim

blonde Italian of pure descent, whereas only the paternal

grandfather of Monsieur Foa had been Italian. Madame

Foa, who had called on Audrey at the Danube, exhibited the

same symptoms of pleasure as her husband.
“But your friend? But your friend?” cried she.
Audrey, being led gradually into the drawing-room, explained

that Miss Ingate had been prevented at the last

moment, etc., etc.
The distinction of Madame Foa’s simple dress had

reassured Audrey to a certain extent, but the size of the

drawing-room disconcerted her again. She had understood

that the house of the Foas was the real esoteric centre of

musical Paris, and she had prepared herself for vast and

luxurious salons, footmen, fountains of wine, rare flowers,

dandies, and the divine shoulders of operatic sopranos who

combined wit with the most seductive charm. The drawing-room

of the Foas was not as large as her own drawing-room

at the Danube. Still it was full, and double doors leading

to an unseen dining-room at right angles to its length produced

an illusion of space. Some of the men and some of

the women were elegant, and even very elegant; others

were not. Audrey instantly with her expert eye saw that

the pictures on the walls were of the last correctness, and a

few by illustrious painters. Here and there she could see

scrawled on them “à mon ami, André Foa.” Such

phenomena were balm. Everybody in the room was presented

to her, and with the greatest particularity, and the

host and hostess gazed on her as on an idol, a jewel, an

exquisite and startling discovery. Musa found two men he

knew. The conversation was resumed with energy.
“And now,” said Madame Foa in English, sitting down

intimately beside Audrey, with a loving gesture, “We will

have a little talk, you and I. I find our friend Madame

Piriac met you last year.”
“Ah! Yes,” murmured Audrey, fatally struck, but

admirably dissembling, for she was determined to achieve

the evening successfully. “Madame Piriac, will she come

to-night?”
“I fear not,” replied Madame Foa. “She would if she

could.”
“I should so like to have seen her again,” said Audrey

eagerly. She was so relieved at Madame Piriac’s not

coming that she felt she could afford to be eager.
And Monsieur Foa, a little distance off, threw a sign into

the duologue, and called:
“You permit me? Your dress ... Exquise! Exquise!

And these pigs of French persist in saying that the English

lack taste!” He clapped his hand to his forehead in

despair of the French.
Then the clanging sound supervened, and the little fox-terrier

yapped, and Monsieur Foa went out, ejaculating

“Ah!” and Madame Foa went into the doorway. Audrey

glanced round for Musa, but he was out of sight in the

dining-room. Several people turned at once and spoke to

her, including two composers who had probably composed

more impossibilities for amateur pianists than any other two

men who ever lived, and a musical critic with large dark

eyes and an Eastern air, who had come from the Opera very

sarcastic about the Opera. One of the composers asked the

critic whether he had not heard Musa play.
“Yes,” said the critic. “I heard him in the Ternes

Quarter—somewhere. He plays very agreeably. Madame,”

he addressed Audrey. “I was discussing with these gentlemen

whether it be not possible to define the principle of

beauty in music. Once it is defined, my trade will be much

simplified, you see. What say you?”
How could she discourse on the principle of beauty in

music when she had the whole weight of the evening on her

shoulders? Musa was the whole weight of the evening.

Would he succeed? She was his mother, his manager, his

creator. He was her handiwork. If he failed she would

have failed. That was her sole interest in him, but it was

an overwhelming interest. When would he be asked to

play? Useless for them to flatter her about her dress, to

treat her like a rarity, if they offered callous, careless, off-hand

remarks, such as “He plays very agreeably.”
She stammered:
“I—I only know what I like.”
One of the composers jumped up excitedly:
“Voilà Madame has said the final word. You hear

me, the final word, the most profound. Argue as you will,

perfect the art of criticism to no matter what point, and you

will never get beyond the final word of Madame.”
The critic shrugged his shoulders, and with a smile bowed

to the ravishing utterer of last words on the most baffling of

subjects. This fluttered person soon perceived that she had

been mistaken in supposing that the room was full. The

clanging sound kept recurring, the dog kept barking, and

new guests continually poured into the room, thereby proving

that it was not full. All comers were introduced to Audrey,

whose head was a dizzy riot of strange names. Then at last

a girl sang, and was applauded. Madame Foa played for

her. “Now,” thought Audrey, “they will ask Musa.”

Then one of the composers played the piano, his themes

punctuated by the clanging sound and by the dog. The

room was asphyxiating, but no one except Audrey seemed

to be inconvenienced. Then several guests rang in quick

succession.
“Madame!” the suave and ardent voice of Foa could

be heard in the entrance-hall. “And thou, Roussel ...

Ippolita, Ippolita!” he called to his wife. “It is Roussel.”
Audrey did not turn her head. She could not. But presently

Roussel, in a blue suit with a wonderful flowing bow

of a black necktie in crêpe de Chine, was led before her. And

Musa was led before Roussel. Audrey, from nervousness, was

moved to relate the history of Musa’s accident to Roussel.
The moment had arrived. Roussel sat down to the piano.

Musa tuned his fiddle.
“From what appears,” murmured Monsieur Foa to nobody

in particular, with an ecstatic expectant smile on his

face, “this Musa is all that is most amazing.”
Then, in the silence, the clanging sound was renewed,

and the fox-terrier reacted.
“André, my friend,” cried Madame Foa, skipping into

the hall. “Will you do me the pleasure of exterminating

this dog?”
Delicate osculatory explosions and pretty exclamations

in the hall! The hostess was encountering an old friend.

There was also a man’s deep English voice. Then a hush.

The man’s voice produced a very strange effect upon Audrey.

Roussel began to play. Musa held his bow aloft. Creeping

steps in the doorway made Audrey look round. A lady

smiled and bowed to her. It was Madame Piriac, resplendent

and serene.
Musa played the Caprice. Audrey did not hear him,

partly because the vision of Madame Piriac, and the man’s

deep voice, had extremely perturbed her, and partly because

she was so desperately anxious for Musa’s triumph. She

had decided that she could make his triumph here the

prelude to tremendous things. When he had finished she

held her breath....
The applause, after an instant, was sudden and extremely

cordial. Monsieur Foa loudly clapped, smiling at Audrey.

Roussel patted Musa on the back and chattered to him

fondly. On each side of her Audrey could catch murmured

exclamations of delight. Musa himself was certainly

pleased and happy.... He had played at Foa’s, where it

was absolutely essential to play if one intended to conquer

Paris and to prove one’s pretensions; and he had found

favour with this satiated and fastidious audience.
“Ouf!” sighed the musical critic Orientally lounging on

a chair. “André, has it occurred to you that we are

expiring for want of air?”
A window was opened, and a shiver went through the

assembly.
The clanging sounded again, but no dog, for the dog had

been exterminated.
“Dauphin, my old pig!” Foa’s greeting from the

entrance floated into the drawing-room, and then a very impressed: “Mademoiselle” from Madame Foa.
“What?” cried Dauphin. “Musa has played? He

played well? So much the better. What did I tell you?”
And he entered the drawing-room with the satisfied air

of having fed Musa from infancy and also of having taught

him all he knew about the violin.
Madame Foa followed him, and with her was Miss Ingate,

gorgeous and blushing. The whole company was now on its

feet and moving about. Miss Ingate scuttered to Audrey.
“Well,” she whispered. “Here I am. I came partly to

satisfy that hysterical Elise, and Monsieur Dauphin met me

on the stairs. But really I came because I’ve had another

letter from Miss Nickall. She’s been and got her arm

broken in a street row. I knew those policemen would do

it one day. I always said they would.”
But Audrey seemed not to be listening. With a side-long

gaze she saw Madame Piriac talking with a middle-aged

Englishman, whose back alone was visible to her.

Madame Piriac laughed and vanished out of sight into the

dining-room. The Englishman turned and met Audrey’s

glance.
Abruptly leaving Miss Ingate, Audrey walked straight

up to the Englishman.
“Good evening,” she said in a low voice. “What is

your name?”
“Gilman,” he answered, with a laugh. “I only this

instant recognised you.”
“Well, Mr. Gilman,” said Audrey, “will you oblige me

very much by not recognising me? I want us to be introduced.

I am most particularly anxious that no one should

know I’m the same girl who helped you to jump off your

yacht at Lousey Hard last year.”
And she moved quickly away.

CHAPTER XVIII
A DECISION
The entire company was sitting or standing round the table

in the dining-room. It was a table at which eight might

have sat down to dinner with a fair amount of comfort; and

perhaps thirty-eight now were successfully claiming an

interest in it. Not at the end, but about a third of the way

down one side, Madame Foa brewed tea in a copper

receptacle over a spirit lamp. At the other extremity was a

battalion of glasses, some syphons and some lofty bottles.

Except for a border of teacups and glasses the rest of the

white expanse was empty, save that two silver biscuit boxes

and a silver cigarette box wandered up and down it according

to the needs of the community. Audrey was sitting next

to the Oriental musical critic, on her left, and on her right

she had a beautiful stout woman who could speak nothing

but Polish, but who expressed herself very clearly in the

language of smiles, nods, and shrugs; to Audrey she seemed

to be extremely romantic; the musical critic could converse

somewhat in Polish, and occasionally he talked across Audrey

to the Pole. Several other languages were flying about.

The subject of discussion was feminism, chiefly as practised

in England. It was Miss Ingate who had begun it; her

striking and peculiar appearance, and in particular her

frock, had given importance to her lightest word. People

who comprehended naught of English listened to her

entranced. The host, who was among these, stood behind

her in a state of ecstasy. Her pale forehead reddened; her

sardonic grin became deliciously self-conscious. “I know

I’m skidding,” she cried. “I know I’m skidding.”
“What does she say? Skeed—skeed?” demanded the

host.
Audrey interpreted. Shouts of laughter!
“Oh! These English! These Englishwomen!” said

the host. “I adore them. I adore them all. They alone

exist.”
“It’s vehy serious!” protested Miss Ingate. “It’s vehy

serious!”
“We shall go to London to-morrow, shan’t we,

Winnie?” said Audrey across the table to her.
“Yes,” agreed Miss Ingate. “I think we ought. We’re

as free as birds. When the police have broken our arms we

can come back to Paris to recover. I shan’t feel comfortable

until I’ve been and had my arm broken—it’s vehy

serious.”
“What does she say? What is it that she says?” from

the host.
More interpretation. More laughter, but this time an

impressed laughter. And Audrey perceived that just as she

was regarding the Polish woman as romantic, so the whole

company was regarding herself and Miss Ingate as romantic.

She could feel the polite, curious eyes of twenty men upon

her; and her mind seemed to stiffen into a formidable

resolve. She grew conscious of the lifting of all depression,

all anxiety. Her conscience was at rest. She had been

thinking for more than a week past: “I ought to go to

London.” How often had she not said to herself: “If any

woman should be in this movement, I should be in this

movement. I am a coward as long as I stay here, dallying

my time away.” Now the decision was made, absolutely.
The Oriental musical critic turned to glance upward

behind his chair. Then he vacated it. The next instant

Madame Piriac was sitting in his place.
She said:
“Are you really going to London to-morrow, Madame?”
“Yes, Madame, really!” answered Audrey firmly, without

the least hesitation.
“How I regret it! For this reason. I wished so much

to make your acquaintance. I mean—to know you a little.

You go perhaps in the afternoon? Could you not do me

the great pleasure of coming to lunch with me? I inhabit

the Quai Voltaire. It is all that is most convenient.”
Audrey was startled and suspicious, but she could not

deny the persuasiveness of the invitation.
“Ah! Madame!” she said. “I know not at what hour

we go. But even if it should be in the afternoon there is

the packing—you know—in a word....”
“Listen,” Madame Piriac proceeded, bending even more

intimately towards her. “Be very, very kind. Come to see

me to-night. Come in my car. I will see that you reach

the Rue Delambre afterwards.”
“But Madame, we are at the Hôtel du Danube. I have

my own car. You are very amiable.”
Madame Piriac was a little taken aback.
“So much the better,” she said, in a new tone. “The

Hôtel du Danube is nearer still. But come in my car.

Mademoiselle Ingate can return in yours. Do not desolate

me.”
“Does she know who I am?” thought Audrey, and

then: “What do I care if she does?”
And she said aloud:
“Madame, it is I who would be desolated to deprive

myself of this pleasure.”
A considerable period elapsed before they could leave,

because of the complex discussion concerning feminism

which was delicately raging round the edge of the table.

The animation was acute, but it was purely intellectual.

The guests discussed the psychology of English suffragettes,

sympathetically, admiringly; they were even wonderstruck;

yet they might have been discussing the psychology of the

ancient Babylonians, so perfect was their detachment, so

completely unclouded by any prejudice was their desire to

reach the truth. Many of the things which they imperturbably

and politely said made Audrey feel glad that she

was a widow. Had she not been a widow, possibly they

would not have been uttered.
And when Madame Piriac and Audrey did rise to go,

both host and hostess began to upbraid. The host, indeed,

barred the doorway with his urbane figure. They were not

kind, they were not true friends, to leave so soon. The

morrow had no sort of importance. The hour was scarcely

one o’clock. Other guests were expected.... Madame

Piriac alone knew how to handle the situation; she appealed

privately to Madame Foa. Having appealed to Madame

Foa, she disappeared with Madame Foa, and could not be

found when Audrey and Miss Ingate were ready to leave.

While these two waited in the antechamber, Monsieur Foa

said suddenly in a confidential tone to Audrey:
“He is charming, Musa, quite charming.”
“Did you like his playing?” Audrey demanded boldly.
She could not understand why it should be necessary for

a violinist to play and to succeed at this house before he could

capture Paris. She was delighted excessively with the

home, but positively it bore no resemblance to what she had

anticipated; nor did it seem to her to possess any of the

attributes of influence; for one of her basic ideas about the

world was that influential people must be dull and formal,

moving about with deliberation in sombrely magnificent

interiors.
“Yes,” said Monsieur Foa. “I like it. He plays

admirably.” And he spoke sincerely. Audrey, however,

was a little disappointed because Monsieur Foa did not

assert that Musa was the most marvellous genius he had

ever listened to.
“I am very, very content to have heard him,” said

Monsieur Foa.
“Do you think he will succeed in Paris?”
“Ah! Madame! There is the Press. There are the

snobs.... In fine....”
“I suppose if he had money?” Audrey murmured.
“Ah! Madame! In Paris, if one has money, one has

everything. Paris—it is not London, where to succeed one

must be truly successful. But he is a player very highly

accomplished. It is miraculous that he should have played

so long in a café—Dauphin told me the history.”
Musa appeared, and after him Madame Piriac. More

appeals, more reproaches, more asseverations that friends

who left so early as one o’clock in the morning were not

friends—and the host at length consented to open the door.

At that very instant the bell clanged. Another guest had

arrived.
When, after the long descent of the stairs (which, however,

unlike the stairs of the Rue Delambre, were lighted),

Audrey saw seven automobiles in the street, she veered again

towards the possibility that the Foas might after all be

influential. Musa and Mr. Gilman, the yachtsman, had

left with the women. Audrey told Miss Ingate to drive

Musa home. She said not a word to him about her

departure the next afternoon, and he made no reference to

it. As the most imposing automobile moved splendidly

away, Mr. Gilman held open the door of Madame Piriac’s

vehicle.
Mr. Gilman sat down opposite to the women. In the

enclosed space the rumour of his heavy breathing was

noticeable. Madame Piriac began to speak in English—her

own English—with a unique accent that Audrey at once

loved.
“You commence soon the yachting, my oncle?” said

she, and turning to Audrey: “Mistair Gilman is no oncle

to me. But he is a great friend of my husband. I call

always him oncle. Do not I, oncle? Mistair Gilman lives

only for the yachting. Every year in May we lose him, till

September.”
“Really!” said Audrey.
Her heart was apprehensively beating. She even suspected

for an instant that both of them knew who she was,

and that Mr. Gilman, before she had addressed him in the

drawing-room, had already related to Madame Piriac the

episode of Mozewater. Then she said to herself that the

idea was absurd; and lastly, repeating within her breast

that she didn’t care, she became desperately bold.
“I should love to buy a yacht,” she said, after a pause.

“We used to live far inland and I know nothing of the sea;

in fact I scarcely saw it till I crossed the Channel, but I

have always dreamed about it.”
“You must come and have a look at my new yacht, Mrs.

Moncreiff,” said Mr. Gilman in his solemn, thick voice. “I

always say that no yacht is herself without ladies on board,

a yacht being feminine, you see.” He gave a little laugh.
“Ah! My oncle!” Madame Piriac broke in. “I see

in that no reason. If a yacht was masculine then I could

see the reason in it.”
“Perhaps not one of my happiest efforts,” said Mf.

Gilman with resignation. “I am a dull man.”
“No, no!” Madame Piriac protested. “You are a dear.

But why have you said nothing to-night at the Foas in the

great discussion about feminism? Not one word have you

said!”
“I really don’t understand it,” said Mr. Gilman.

“Either everybody is mad, or I am mad. I dare say I am

mad.”
“Well,” said Madame Piriac. “I said not much myself,

but I enjoyed it. It was better than the music, music, which

they talk always there. People talk too much shops in

these days. It is out-to-place and done over.”
“Do you mean overdone?” asked Mr. Gilman mildly.
“Well, overdone, if you like better that.”
“Do you mean shop, Hortense?” asked Mr. Gilman

further.
“Shop, shop! The English is impossible!”
The automobile crossed the Seine and arrived in the

CHAPTER XIX
THE BOUDOIR
In the setting of her own boudoir Madame Piriac equalled,

and in some ways surpassed, the finest pictures which

Audrey had imagined of her. Her evening dress made

Audrey doubt whether after all her own was the genuine

triumph which she had supposed; in Madame Piriac’s

boudoir, and close by Madame Piriac, it had disconcertingly

the air of being an ingenious but unconvincing imitation of

the real thing.
But Madame Piriac’s dress had the advantage of being

worn with the highest skill and assurance; Madame Piriac

knew what the least fold of her dress was doing, in the way

of effect, on the floor behind her back. And Madame

Piriac was mistress, not only of her dress, but of herself

and all her faculties. A handsome woman, rather more than

slim, but not plump, she had an expression of confidence, of

knowing exactly what she was about, of foreseeing all her

effects, which Audrey envied more than she had ever envied

anything.
As soon as Audrey came into the room she had said to

herself: “I will have a boudoir like this.” It was an

interior in which every piece of furniture was loaded with

objects personal to its owner. So many signed photographs,

so much remarkable bric-à-brac, so many intimate

contrivances of ornamental comfort, Audrey had never

before seen within four walls. The chandelier, comprising

ten thousand crystals, sparkled down upon a

complex aggregate of richness overwhelming to everybody

except Madame Piriac, who subdued it, understood it, and

had the key to it. Audrey wondered how many servants

took how many hours to dust the room. She was sure,

however, that whatever the number of servants required,

Madame Piriac managed them all to perfection. She longed

violently to be as old as Madame Piriac, whom she

assessed at twenty-nine and a half, and to be French, and to

know all about everything in life as Madame Piriac did.

Yet at the same time she was extremely determined to be

Audrey, and not to be intimidated by Madame Piriac or by

anyone.
Just as they were beginning to suck iced lemonade up

straws—a delightful caprice of Madame Piriac’s, well suited

to catch Audrey’s taste—the door opened softly, and a tall,

very dark, bearded man, appreciably older than Madame

Piriac, entered with a kind of soft energy, and Mr. Gilman

followed him.
“Ah! My friend!” murmured Madame Piriac. “You

give me pleasure. This is Madame Moncreiff, of whom I

have spoken to you. Madame—my husband. We have just

come from the Foas.”
Monsieur Piriac bent over Audrey’s hand, and smiled

with vivacity, and they talked a little of the evening, carelessly,

as though time existed not. And then Monsieur

Piriac said to his wife:
“Dear friend. I have to work with this old Gilman.

We shall therefore ask you to excuse us. Till to-morrow,

then. Good night.”
“Good night, my friend. Do not do harm to yourself.

Good night, my oncle.”
Monsieur Piriac saluted with formality but with sincerity.
“Oh!” thought Audrey, as the men went away. “I

should want to marry exactly him if I did want to marry.

He doesn’t interfere; he isn’t curious; he doesn’t want to

know. He leaves her alone. She leaves him alone. How

clever they are!”
“My husband is now chief of the Cabinet of the Foreign

Minister,” said Madame Piriac with modest pride. “They

kill themselves, you know, in that office—especially in these

times. But I watch. And I tell Monsieur Gilman to watch....

How nice you are when you sit in a chair like that!

Only Englishwomen know how to use an easy chair....

To say nothing of the frock.”
“Madame Piriac,” Audrey brusquely demanded with an

expression of ingenuous curiosity. “Why did you bring me

here?” It was the cry of an animal at once rash and

rather desperate, determined to unmask all the secret

dangers that might be threatening.
“I much desired to see you,” Madame Piriac answered

very smoothly, “in order to apologise to you for my

indiscreet question on the night when we first met. Your

fairy tale about your late husband was a very proper reply to

the attitude of Madame Rosamund—as you all call her. It

was very clever—so clever that I myself did not appreciate

it until after I had spoken. Ever since that moment I have

wanted to explain, to know you more. Also your pretence

of going to sleep in the automobile showed what in a woman

I call distinguished talent.”
“But, Madame, I assure you that I really was asleep.”
“So much the better. The fact proves that your

instinct for the right thing is quite exceptional. It is not

that I would criticise Madame Rosamund, who has genius.

Nevertheless her genius causes her to commit errors of

which others would be incapable.... So she has captured

you, too.”
“Captured me!” Audrey protested—and she was

made stronger by the flattering reference to her distinguished

talent. “I’ve never seen her from that day to

this!”
“No. But she has captured you. You are going.”
“Going where?”
“To London, to take part in these riots.”
“I shan’t have anything to do with riots.”
“Within a month you will have been in a riot, Madame ...

and I shall regret it.”
“And even if I am, Madame! You are a friend of

Rosamund’s. You must be in sympathy.”
“In sympathy with what?”
“With—with all this suffragism, feminism. I am anyway!”

Audrey sat up straight. “It’s horrible that women

don’t have the Vote. And it’s horrible the things they have

to suffer in order to get it. But they will get it!”
“Why do you say ‘they’?”
“I mean ‘we.’”
“Supposing you meant ‘they,’ after all? And you did,

Madame. Let me tell you. You ask me if I sympathise

with suffragism. You might as well ask me if I sympathise

with a storm or with an earthquake, or with a river running

to the sea. Perhaps I do. But perhaps I do not. That

has no importance. Feminism is a natural phenomenon; it

was unavoidable. You Englishwomen will get your vote.

Even we in France will get it one day. It cannot be denied....

Sympathy is not required. But let us suppose that all

women joined the struggle. What would happen to women?

What would happen to the world? Just as nunneries were

a necessity of other ages, so even in this age women must

meditate. Far more than men they need to understand

themselves. Until they understand themselves how can they

understand men? The function of women is to understand.

Their function is also to preserve. All the beautiful and

luxurious things in the world are in the custody of women.

Men would never of themselves keep a tradition. If there is

anything on earth worth keeping, women must keep it.

And the tradition will be lost if every woman listens to

Madame Rosamund. That is what she cannot see. Her

genius blinds her. You say I am a friend of Madame

Rosamund. I am. Madame Rosamund was educated in

Paris, at the same school as my aunt and myself. But I

have never helped her in her mission. And I never will.

My vocation is elsewhere. When she fled over here from

the English police, she came to me. I received her. She

asked me to drive her to certain addresses. I did so. She

was my guest. I surrounded her with all that she had

abandoned, all that her genius had forced her to abandon.

But I never spoke to her of her work, nor she to me of it.

Still, I dare to think that I was of some value to the woman

in Madame Rosamund.”
Audrey felt very young and awkward and defiant. She

felt defiant because Madame Piriac had impressed her,

and she was determined not to be impressed.
“So you wanted to tell me all this,” said she, putting

down her glass, with the straws in it, on a small round

table laden with tiny figures in silver. “Why did you

want to tell me, Madame?”
“I wanted to tell you because I want you to do nothing

that you will regret. You greatly interested me the moment

I saw you. And when I saw you in that studio, in that

Quarter, I feared for you.”
“Feared what?”
“I feared that you might mistake your vocation—that

vocation which is so clearly written on your face. I saw

a woman young and free and rich, and I was afraid that

she might waste everything.”
“But do you know anything about me?”
Madame Piriac paused before replying.
“Nothing but what I see. But I see that you are in

a high degree what all women are to a greater extent

than men—an individualist. You know the feeling that

comes over a woman in hours of complete intimacy with

a man? You know what I mean?”
“Oh, yes!” Audrey agreed, blushing.
“In those moments we perceive that only the individual

counts with us. And with you, above all, the individual

should count. Unless you use your youth and your freedom

and your money for some individual, you will never be

content; you will eternally regret. All that is in your face.”
Audrey blushed more, thinking of certain plans formed

in that head of hers. She said nothing. She was both

very pleased and very exasperated.
“I have a relative in England, a young girl,” Madame

Piriac proceeded, “in some unpronounceable county. We

write to each other. She is excessively English.”
Audrey was scarlet. Several times during the sojourn

in Paris she had sent letters (to Madame Piriac) to be

posted in Essex by Mr. Foulger. These letters were full

of quaint inventions about winter life in Essex, and other

matters.
Madame Piriac, looking reflectively at the red embers

of wood in the grate, went on:
“She says she may come to Paris soon. I have often

asked her to come, but she has refused. Perhaps next

month I shall go to England to fetch her. I should like

her to know you—very much. She is younger than you

are, but only a little, I think.”
“I shall be delighted, if I am here,” Audrey stammered,

and she rose. “You are a very kind woman. Very, very

amiable. You do not know how much I admire you. I

wish I was like you. But I am not. You have seen only

one side of me. You should see the inside. It is very

strange. I must go to London. I am forced to go to

London. I should be a coward if I did not go to London.

Tell me, is my dress really good? Or is it a deception?”
Madame Piriac smiled, and kissed her on both cheeks.
“It is good,” said Madame Piriac. “But your maid is

not all that she ought to be. However, it is good.”
“If you had simply praised it, and only that, I should

not have been content,” said Audrey, and kissed Madame

Piriac in the English way, the youthful and direct way.
Not another word about the male sex, the female sex,

tradition or individualism, passed between them.
Mr. Gilman was summoned to take Audrey across the

river to the right bank. They went in a taxi. He was

protective and very silent. But just as the cab was

turning out of the Rue de Rivoli into the Rue Castiglione

he said:
“I shall obey you absolutely, Mrs. Moncreiff. It is

a great pleasure for an old, lonely man to keep a secret

for a young and charming woman. A greater pleasure

than you can possibly imagine. You may count on me.

I am not a talker, but you have put me under an obligation,

and I am very grateful.”
She took care that her thanks should reward him.
“Winnie,” she burst out in the rose-coloured secrecy

of the bedroom, “has Elise gone to bed? ... All right.

Well, I’m lost. Madame Piniac is going to England to

fetch me.”

CHAPTER XX
PAGET GARDENS
“Has anything happened in this town?” asked Audrey

of Miss Ingate.
It was the afternoon of the day following their arrival

in London from Paris, and it was a fine afternoon. They

were walking from the Charing Cross Hotel, where they

had slept, to Paget Gardens.
“Anything happened?” repeated Miss Ingate. “What

you mean? I don’t see anything vehy particular on the

posters.”
“Everybody looks so sad and worried, compared with

people in Paris.”
“So they do! So they do!” cried Miss Ingate. “Oh,

yes! So they do! I wondered what it was seemed so

queer. That’s it. Well, of course you mustn’t forget we’re

in England. I always did say it was a vehy peculiar place.”
“Do we look like that?” Audrey suggested.
“I expect we do.”
“I’m quite sure that I don’t, Winnie, anyway. I’m

really very cheerful. I’m surprisingly cheerful.”
It was true. Also she both looked and felt more girlish

than ever in Paris. Impossible to divine, watching her in

her light clothes, and with her airy step, that she was the

relict of a man who had so tragically died of blood-poisoning

caused by bad table manners.
“I’ve a good mind to ask a policeman,” said she.
“You’d better not,” Miss Ingate warned her.
Audrey instantly turned into the roadway, treating the

creosoted wood as though it had been rose-strewn velvet,

and reached a refuge where a policeman was standing. The

policeman bent with benevolence and politeness to listen to

her tale.
“Excuse me,” she said, smiling innocently up at him,

“but is anything the matter?”
“What street, miss?” he questioned, bending lower.
“Is anything the matter? All the people round here are

so gloomy.”
The policeman glanced at her.
“There will be something the matter,” he remarked

calmly. “There will be something the matter pretty soon

if I have much more of that suffragette sauce. I thought

you was one of them the moment I saw you, but I wasn’t

sure.”
This was the first time Audrey had ever spoken to a

policeman, save Inspector Keeble, at Moze, who was a

friendly human being. And she had a little pang of fear.

The policeman was like a high wall of blue cloth, with a

marvellous imitation of a human face at the top, and above

the face a cupola.
“Thank you,” she murmured reproachfully, and

hastened back to Miss Ingate, who heard the tale with a

grinning awe that was, nevertheless, sardonic. They

pressed onwards to Piccadilly Circus, where the only normal

and cheerful living creatures were the van horses and the

flower-women; and up Regent Street, through crowds of

rapt and mystical women and romantical men who had

apparently wandered out of a play by Henrik Ibsen.
They then took a motor-bus, which was full of the same

enigmatic, far-gazing heroines and heroes. When they

got off, the conductor pointed dreamily in a certain direction

and murmured the words: “Paget Square.” Their desire

was Paget Gardens, and, after finding Paget Square, Paget

Mansions, Paget Houses, Paget Street, Paget Mews, and

Upper Paget Street, they found Paget Gardens. It was a

terrace of huge and fashionable houses fronting on an

immense, blank brick wall. The houses were very lofty;

so lofty that the architect, presumably afraid of hitting

heaven with his patent chimney cowls, had sunk the lowest

storey deep into the earth. Looking over the high palisades

which protected the pavement from the precipice thus made,

one could plainly see the lowest storey and all that was

therein.
“Whoever can she be staying with?” exclaimed Miss

Ingate. “It’s a marchioness at least. There’s no doubt

the very best people are now in the movement.”
Audrey went first up massive steps, and, choosing with

marked presence of mind the right bell, rang it, expecting

to see either a butler or a footman.
A young woman, however, answered the ring. She wore

a rather shabby serge frock, but no apron, and she did not

resemble any kind of servant. Her ruddy, heavy, and

slightly resentful face fronted the visitors with a steady,

challenging stare.
“Does Miss Nickall live here?” asked Audrey.
“Aye! She does!” came the answer, with a northern

accent.
“We’ve come to see how she is.”
“Happen ye’d better step inside, then,” said the young

woman.
They stepped inside to an enormous and obscure interior;

the guardian banged the door, and negligently led them

forward.
“It is a large house,” Miss Ingate ventured, against the

silent intimidation of the place.
“One o’ them rich uns,” said the guardian. “She

lends it to the Cause when she doesn’t want it herself, to

show her sympathy. Saves her a caretaker—they all know

I’m one to look right well after a house.”
Having passed two very spacious rooms and a wide

staircase, she opened the door of a smaller but still a considerable

room.
“Here y’are,” she muttered.
This room, like the others, was thoroughly sheeted, and

thus presented a misty and spectral appearance. All the

chairs, the chandelier, and all the pictures, were masked

in close-fitting pale yellow. The curtains were down, the

carpet was up, and a dust sheet was spread under the table

in the middle of the floor.
“Here’s some friends of yours,” said the guardian,

throwing her words across the room.
In an easy chair near the fireplace sat Miss Nickall, her

arm in splints and in a sling. She was very thin and very

pallid, and her eyes brightly glittered. The customary kind

expression of her face was modified, though not impaired,

by a look of vague apprehension.
“Mind how ye handle her,” the guardian gave warning,

when Nick yielded herself to be embraced.
“You’re just a bit of my Paris come to see me,” said

Nick, with her American accent. Then through her tears:

“How’s Tommy, and how’s Musa, and how’s—how’s my

studio? Oh! This is Miss Susan Foley, sister of Jane

Foley. Jane will be here for tea. Susan—Miss Ingate and

Mrs. Moncreiff.”
Susan gave a grim bob.
“Is Jane Foley coming? Does she live here?” asked

Miss Ingate, properly impressed by the name of her who

was the St. George of Suffragism, and perhaps the most

efficient of all militants. “Audrey, we are in luck!”
When Nick had gathered items of information about

Paris, she burst out:
“I can’t believe I’ve only met you once before. You’re

just like old friends.”
“So we are old friends,” said Audrey. “Your letters

to Winnie have made us old friends.”
“And when did you come over?”
“Last night,” Miss Ingate replied. “We should have

called this morning to see you, but Mrs. Moncreiff had so

much business to do and people to see. I don’t know what

it all was. She’s very mysterious.”
As a fact, Audrey had had an interview with Mr.

Foulger, who, with laudable obedience, had come up to

town from Chelmsford in response to a telegram. Miss

Ingate was aware of this, but she was not aware of other

and more recondite interviews which Audrey had accomplished.
“And how did this happen?” eagerly inquired Miss

Ingate, at last, pointing to the bandaged arm.
Nick’s face showed discomfort.
“Please don’t let us talk about that,” said Nick. “It

was a policeman. I don’t think he meant it. I had

chained myself to the railings of St. Margaret’s Church.”
Susan Foley put in laconically:
“She’s not to be worried. I hope ye’ll stay for tea.

We shall have tea at five sharp. Janey’ll be in.”
“Can’t they sleep here, Susan?” Nick whimpered.
“Of course they can, and welcome,” said Susan.

“There’s more empty beds in this barracks than they could

sleep in if they slept all day and all night.”
“But we’re staying at an hotel. We can’t possibly put

you to all this trouble,” Audrey protested.
“No trouble. It’s my business. It’s what I’m here

for,” said Susan Foley. “I’d sooner have it than mill work

any day o’ the week.”
“You’re just going to be very mean if you don’t stay

here,” Nick faltered. Tears stood in her eyes again. “You

don’t know how I feel.” She murmured something about

Betty Burke’s doings,
“We will stay! We will stay!” Miss Ingate agreed

hastily. And, unperceived by Nick, she gave Audrey a

glance in which irony and tenderness were mingled. It

was as if she had whispered, “The nerves of this angel have

all gone to pieces. We must humour the little sentimental

simpleton.”

CHAPTER XXI
JANE
“We’ve begun, ye see,” said Susan Foley.
It was two minutes past five, and Miss Ingate and

Audrey, followed by Nick with her slung arm, entered the

sheeted living-room. Tremendous feats had been performed.

All the Moncreiff and Ingate luggage, less than two hours

earlier lying at the Charing Cross Hotel, was now in two

adjoining rooms on the third floor of the great house in

Paget Gardens. Drivers and loiterers had assisted, under

the strict and taciturn control of Susan Foley. Also Nick,

Miss Ingate, and Audrey had had a most intimate conversation,

and the two latter had changed their attire to suit the

station of campers in a palace.
“It’s lovely to be quite free and independent,” Audrey

had said, and the statement had been acclaimed.
Jane Foley was seated opposite her sister at the small

table plainly set for five. She rose vivaciously, and came

forward with outstretched hand. She wore a blue skirt and

a white blouse and brown boots. She was twenty-eight,

but her rather small proportions and her plentiful golden,

fluffy hair made her seem about twenty. Her face was less

homely than Susan’s, and more mobile. She smiled somewhat

shyly, with an extraordinary radiant cheerfulness. It

was impossible for her to conceal the fact that she was very

good-natured and very happy. Finally, she limped.
“Susan will have the meals prompt,” she said, as they

all sat down. “And as Susan left home on purpose to look

after me, of course she’s the mistress. As far as that goes,

she always was.”
Susan was spreading jam on a slice of bread-and-butter

for the one-armed Nick.
“I dare say you don’t remember me playing the barrel

organ all down Regent Street that day, do you?” said

Miss Ingate.
“Oh, yes; quite well. You were magnificent!” answered

Jane, with blue eyes sparkling.
“Well, though I only just saw you—I was so busy—I

should remember you anywhere, Miss Foley,” said Miss

Ingate.
“Do you notice any difference in her?” questioned

Susan Foley harshly.
“N-o,” said Miss Ingate. “Except, perhaps, she looks

even younger.”
“Didn’t you notice she’s lame?”
“Oh, well—yes, I did. But you didn’t expect me to

mention that, did you? I thought your sister had just

sprained her ankle, or something.”
“No,” said Susan. “It’s for life. Tell them about it,

Jenny. They don’t know.”
Jane Foley laughed lightly.
“It was all in the day’s work,” she said. “It was at

my last visit to Holloway.”
Audrey, gazing at her entranced, like a child, murmured

with awe:
“Have you been to prison, then?”
“Three times,” said Jane pleasantly. “And I shall be

going again soon. I’m only out while they’re trying to

think of some new way of dealing with me, poor things!

I’m generally watched. It must cost them a fearful lot of

money. But what are they to do?”
“But how were you lamed? I can’t eat any tea if you

don’t tell me—really I can’t!”
“Oh, all right!” Jane laughed. “It was after that

Liberal mass meeting in Peel Park, at Bradford. I’d begun

to ask questions, as usual, you know—questions they can’t

answer—and then some Liberal stewards, with lovely rosettes

in their buttonholes, came round me and started cutting my

coat with their penknives. They cut it all to pieces. You

see that was the best argument they could think of in the

excitement of the moment. I believe they’d have cut up

every stitch I had, only perhaps it began to dawn on them

that it might be awkward for them. Then two of them

lifted me up, one by the feet and the other by the shoulders,

and carried me off. They wouldn’t let me walk. I told

them they’d hurt my leg, but they were too busy to listen.

As soon as they came across a policeman they said they had

done it all to save me from being thrown into the lake by

a brutal and infuriated mob. I just had enough breath left

to thank them. Of course, the police weren’t going to stand

that, so I was taken that night to London. Everything was

thought of except my tea. But I expect they forgot that on

purpose so that I should be properly hungry when I got to

Holloway. However, I said to myself, ‘If I can’t eat and

drink when I want, I won’t eat and drink when they want!’

And I didn’t.
“After I’d paid my respects at Bow Street, and was

back at Holloway, I just stamped on everything they offered

me, and wrote a petition to the Governor asking to be

treated as a political prisoner. Instead of granting the petition

he kept sending me more and more beautiful food, and

I kept stamping on it. Then three magistrates arrived and

sat on my case, and sentenced me to the punishment cells.

They ran off as soon as they’d sentenced me. I said I

wouldn’t go to their punishment cells. I told everybody

again how lame I was. So five wardresses carried me there,

but they dropped me twice on the way. It was a very

interesting cell, the punishment cell was. If it had been

in the Tower, everybody would go to look at it because of

its quaintness. There were two pools of water near to the

bed. I was three days in the cell, and those pools of water

were always there; I could see them because from where I

lay on the bed the light glinted on them. Just one gleam

from the tiny cobwebby window high up. I hadn’t anything

to read, of course, but even if I’d had something I

couldn’t see to read. The bed was two planks, just raised

an inch or two above the water, and the pillow was wooden.

Never any trouble about making beds like that! The entire

furniture of this cosy drawing-room was—you’ll never

guess—a tree-stump, meant for a chair, I think. And on

this tree-stump was an india-rubber cup. I could just see it

across the cell.
“At night the wardresses were struck with pity, or

perhaps it was the Governor. Anyhow, they brought me

a mattress and a rug. They told me to get up off the

bed, and I told them I couldn’t get up, couldn’t even

turn over. So they said, ‘Very well, then; you can do

without these things,’ and they took them away. The

funny thing was that I really couldn’t get up. If I tried

to move, my leg made me want to shriek.
“After three days they decided to take me to the prison

hospital. I shrieked all the way—couldn’t help it. They

laughed. So then I laughed. In the hospital, the doctor

decided that my left ankle was sprained and my right

thigh broken. So I had the best of them, after all. They

had to admit they were wrong. It was most awkward

for them. Then I thought I might as well begin to eat.

But they had to be very careful what they gave me. I

hadn’t had anything for nearly six days, you see. They

were in a fearful stew. Doctor was there day and night.

And it wasn’t his fault. I told him he had all my sympathies.

He said he was very sorry I should be lame for life, but

it couldn’t be helped, as the thigh had been left too long.

I said, ‘Please don’t mention it.’”
“But did they keep you after that?”
“Keep me! They implored my friends to take me away.

No man was ever more relieved that the poor dear Governor

of Holloway Prison, and the Home Secretary himself, too,

when I left in a motor ambulance. The Governor raised

his hat to two of my friends. He would have eaten out

of my hand if I’d had a few more days to tame him.”
Audrey’s childlike and intense gaze had become extremely

noticeable. Jane Foley felt it upon herself, and grew a

little self-conscious. Susan Foley noticed it with eager

and grim pride, and she made a sharp movement instead

of saying: “Yes, you do well to stare. You’ve got

something worth staring at.”
Nick noticed it, with moisture in her glittering, hysteric

eyes. Miss Ingate noticed it ironically. “You, pretending

to be a widow, and so knowing and so superior! Why,

you’re a schoolgirl!” said the expressive curve of Miss

Ingate’s shut lips.
And, in fact, Audrey was now younger than she had

ever been in Paris. She was the girl of six or seven

years earlier, who, at night at school, used to insist upon

hearing stories of real people, either from a sympathetic

teacher or from the other member of the celebrated secret

society. But she had never heard any tale to compare

with Jane Foley’s. It was incredible that this straightforward,

simple girl at the table should be the world-renowned

Jane Foley. What most impressed Audrey in

Jane was Jane’s happiness. Jane was happy, as Audrey

had not imagined that anyone could be happy. She had

within her a supply of happiness that was constantly

bubbling up. The ridiculousness and the total futility of

such matters as motor-cars, fine raiment, beautiful boudoirs

and correctness smote Audrey severely. She saw that there

was only one thing worth having, and that was the

mysterious thing that Jane Foley had. This mysterious

thing rendered innocuous cruelty, stupidity and injustice,

and reduced them to rather pathetic trifles.
“But I never saw all this in the papers!” Audrey

exclaimed.
“No paper—I mean no respectable paper—would print it.

Of course, we printed it in our own weekly paper.”
“Why wouldn’t any respectable paper print it?”
“Because it’s not nice. Don’t you see that I ought

to have been at home mending stockings instead of gallivanting

round with Liberal stewards and policemen and

prison governors?”
“And why aren’t you mending stockings?” asked Audrey,

with a delicious quizzical smile that crept gradually through

the wonder and admiration in her face.
“You pal!” cried Jane Foley impulsively. “I must

hug you!” And she did. “I’ll tell you why I’m not

mending stockings, and why Susan has had to leave off

mending stockings in order to look after me. Susan and

I worked in a mill when she was ten and I was eleven.

We were ‘tenters.’ We used to get up at four or five

in the morning and help with the housework, and then

put on our clogs and shawls and be at the mill at six.

We worked till twelve, and then in the afternoon we went

to school. The next day we went to school in the morning

and to the mill in the afternoon. When we were thirteen

we left school altogether, and worked twelve hours a day

in the mill. In the evenings we had to do housework.

In fact, all our housework was done before half-past five

in the morning and after half-past six in the evening.

We had to work just as hard as the men and boys in the

mill. We got a great deal less money and a great deal

less decent treatment; but to make up we had to slave

in the early morning and late at night, while the men

either snored or smoked. I was all right. But Susan

wasn’t. And a lot of women weren’t, especially young

mothers with babies. So I learnt typewriting on the quiet,

and left it all to try and find out whether something couldn’t

be done. I soon found out—after I’d heard Rosamund

speak. That’s the reason I’m not mending stockings.

I’m not blaming anybody. It’s no one’s fault, really. It

certainly isn’t men’s fault. Only something has to be

altered, and most people detest alterations. Still, they

do get done somehow in the end. And so there you

are!”
“I should love to help,” said Audrey. “I expect I’m

not much good, but I should love to.”
She dared not refer to her wealth, of which, in fact,

she was rather ashamed.
“Well, you can help, all right,” said Jane Foley, rising.

“Are you a member?”
“No. But I will be to-morrow.”
“They’ll give you something to do,” said Jane Foley.
“Oh yes!” remarked Miss Ingate. “They’ll keep you

busy enough—and charge you for it.”
Susan Foley began to clear the table.
“Supper at nine,” said she curtly.

CHAPTER XXII
THE DETECTIVE
Audrey and Miss Ingate were writing letters to Paris.

Jane Foley had gone forth again to a committee meeting,

which was understood to be closely connected with a great

Liberal demonstration shortly to be held in a Midland

fortress of Liberalism. Miss Nickall, in accordance with

medical instructions, had been put to bed. Susan Foley

was in the basement, either clearing up tea or preparing

supper.
Miss Ingate, putting her pen between her teeth and

looking up from a blotting-pad, said to Audrey across

the table:
“Are you writing to Musa?”
“Certainly not!” said Audrey, with fire. “Why should

I write to Musa?” She added: “But you can write to

him, if you like.”
“Oh! Can I?” observed Miss Ingate, grinning.
Audrey knew of no reason why she should blush before

Miss Ingate, yet she began to blush. She resolved not to

blush; she put all her individual force into the enterprise

of resisting the tide of blood to her cheeks, but the tide

absolutely ignored her, as the tide of ocean might have

ignored her.
She rose from the table, and, going into a corner,

fidgeted with the electric switches, turning certain additional

lights off and on.
“All right,” said Miss Ingate; “I’ll write to him.

I’m sure he’ll expect something. Have you finished your

letters?”
“Yes.”
“Well, what’s this one on the table, then?”
“I shan’t go on with that one.”
“Any message for Musa?”
“You might tell him,” said Audrey, carefully examining

the drawn curtains of the window, “that I happened to

meet a French concert agent this morning who was very

interested in him.”
“Did you?” cried Miss Ingate. “Where?”
“It was when I was out with Mr. Foulger. The agent

asked me whether I’d heard a man named Musa play in

Paris. Of course I said I had. He told me he meant

to take him up and arrange a tour for him. So you might

tell Musa he ought to be prepared for anything.”
“Wonders will never cease!” said Miss Ingate. “Have

I got enough stamps?”
“I don’t see anything wonderful in it,” Audrey sharply

replied. “Lots of people in Paris know he’s a great

player, and those Jew concert agents are always awfully

keen—at least, so I’m told. Well, perhaps, after all, you’d

better not tell him. It might make him conceited....

Now, look here, Winnie, do hurry up, and let’s go out

and post those letters. I can’t stand this huge house.

I keep on imagining all the empty rooms in it. Hurry

up and come along.”
Shortly afterwards Miss Ingate shouted downstairs into

the earth:
“Miss Foley, we’re both just going out to post some

letters.”
The faint reply came:
“Supper at nine.”
At the farther corner of Paget Square they discovered

a pillar-box standing solitary in the chill night among the

vast and threatening architecture.
“Do let’s go to a café,” suggested Audrey.
“A café?”
“Yes. I want to be jolly. I must break loose somewhere

to-night. I can’t wait till to-morrow. I was feeling

splendid till Jane Foley went. Then the house began to

get on my nerves, not to mention Susan Foley, with her

supper at nine. Do all people in London fix their meals

hours and hours beforehand? I suppose they do. We

used to at Moze. But I’d forgotten. Come along, Winnie.”
“But there are no cafés in London.”
“There must be some cafés somewhere.”
“Only public-houses and restaurants. Of course, we

could go to a teashop, but they’re all shut up now.”
“Well, then, what do people do in London when they

want to be jolly? I always thought London was a

terrific town.”
“They never want to be jolly,” said Miss Ingate. “If

they feel as if they couldn’t help being jolly, then they

hire a private room somewhere and draw the blinds

down.”
With no more words, Audrey seized Miss Ingate by

the arm and they walked off, out of the square and into

empty and silent streets where highly disciplined gas-lamps

kept strict watch over the deportment of colossal houses.

In their rapid stroll they seemed to cover miles, but they

could not escape from the labyrinth of tremendous and

correct houses, which in squares and in terraces and in

crescents displayed the everlasting characteristics of comfort,

propriety and self-satisfaction. Now and then a wayfarer

passed them. Now and then a taxicab sped through the

avenues of darkness like a criminal pursued by the impalpable.

Now and then a red light flickered in a porch instead

of a white one. But there was no surcease from the sinister

spell until suddenly they emerged into a long, wide, illumined

thoroughfare of shut shops that stretched to infinity on

either hand. And a vermilion motor-bus meandered by,

and this motor-bus was so sad, so inexpressibly wistful, in

the solemn wilderness of the empty artery, that the two

women fled from the strange scene and penetrated once

more into the gigantic and fearful maze from which they

had for an instant stood free. Soon they were quite lost.

Till that day and night Audrey had had a notion that Miss

Ingate, though bizarre, did indeed know every street in

London. The delusion was destroyed.
“Never mind,” said Miss Ingate. “If we keep on we’re

bound to come to a cabstand, and then we can take a taxi

and go wherever we like—Regent Street, Piccadilly, anywhere.

That’s the convenience of London. As soon as

you come to a cabstand you’re all right.”
And then, in the distance, Audrey saw a man apparently

tampering with a gate that led to an area.
“Why,” she said excitedly, “that’s the house we’re

staying in!”
“Of course it isn’t!” said Miss Ingate. “This isn’t

Paget Gardens, because there are houses on both sides of it

and there’s a big wall on one side of Paget Gardens. I’m

sure we’re at least two miles off our beds.”
“Well, then, how is it Nick’s hairbrushes are on the

window-sill there, where she put them when she went to

bed? I can see them quite plain. This is the side street—what’s-its-name?

There’s the wall over there at the end.

Don’t you remember—it’s a corner house. This is the side

of it.”
“I believe you’re right,” admitted Miss Ingate. “What

can that man be doing there?”
They plainly saw him open the gate and disappear down

the area steps.
“It’s a burglar,” said Audrey. “This part must be a

regular paradise for burglars.”
“More likely a detective,” Miss Ingate suggested.
Audrey was thrilled.
“I do hope it is!” she murmured. “How heavenly!

Miss Foley said she was being watched, didn’t she?”
“What had we better do?” Miss Ingate faltered.
“Do, Winnie?” Audrey whispered, tugging at her arm.

“We must run in at the front door and tell Supper-at-nine-o’clock.”
They kept cautiously on the far side of the street until

the end of it, when they crossed over, nipped into the dark

porch of the house and rang the bell.
Susan Foley opened for them. There was no light in

the hall.
“Oh, is there?” said Susan Foley, very calmly, when

she heard the news. “I think I know who it is. I’ve seen

him hanging round my scullery door before. How did he

climb over those railings?”
“He didn’t. He opened the gate.”
“Well, I locked the gate myself this afternoon. So he’s

got a key. I shall manage him all right. We’ll get the

fire-extinguishers. There’s about a dozen of ’em, I should

think, in this house. They’re rather heavy, but we can

do it.”
Turning on the light in the hall, she immediately lifted

from its hook a red-coloured metal cone about twenty inches

long and eight inches in diameter at the base. “In case of

fire drive in knob by hard blow against floor, and let

liquid play on flames,” she read the instructions on the

side. “I know them things,” she said. “It spurts out

like a fountain, and it’s a rather nasty chemistry sort of a

fluid. I shall take one downstairs to the scullery, and the

others we’ll have upstairs in the room over Miss Nickall’s.

We can put ’em in the housemaid’s lift.... I shall open

the scullery door and leave it a bit open like, and when he

comes in I’ll be ready for him behind the door with this.

If he thinks he can come spying after our Janey like

this——”
“But——” Miss Ingate began.
“You aren’t feeling very well, are ye, miss?” Susan

Foley demanded, as she put two extinguishers into the

housemaid’s lift. “Better go and sit down in the parlour.

You won’t be wanted. Mrs. Moncreiff and me can

manage.”
“Yes, we can!” agreed Audrey enthusiastically. “Run

along, Winnie.”
After about two minutes of hard labour Susan ran away

and brought a key to Audrey.
“You sneak out,” she said, “and lock the gate on him.

I lay he’ll want a new suit of clothes when I done with

him!”
Ecstatically, joyfully, Audrey took the key and departed.

Miss Ingate was sitting in the hall, staring about her like an

undecided bird. Audrey crept round into the side street.

Nobody was in sight. She could not see over the railings,

but she could see between them into the abyss of the area.

The man was there. She could distinguish his dark form

against the inner wall. With every conspiratorial precaution,

she pulled the gate to, inserted the key, and locked it.
A light went up in the scullery window, of which the

blind was drawn. The man peeped at the sides of the

blind. Then the scullery door was opened. The man

started. A piece of wood was thrown out on to the floor

of the area, and the door swung outwards. Then the

light in the scullery was extinguished. The man waited

a few moments. He had noticed that the door was not

quite closed, and the interstice irresistibly fascinated him.

He approached and put his hand against the door. It

yielded. He entered. The next instant there was a bang

and a cry, and a strong spray of white liquid appeared, in

the middle of which was the man’s head. The door slammed

and a bolt was shot. The man, spluttering, coughing, and

swearing, rubbed his eyes and wiped water from his face

with his hands. His hat was on the ground. At first he

could not see at all, but presently he felt his way towards

the steps and began to climb them. Audrey ran off towards

the corner. She could see and hear him shaking the gate and

then trying to get a key into it. But as Audrey had left her

key in the other side of the lock, he failed in the attempt.
The next thing was that a window opened in the high

wall-face of the house and an immense stream of liquid

descended full on the man’s head. Susan Foley was at

the window, but only the nozzle of the extinguisher could

be seen. The man tried to climb over the railings; he did

not succeed; they had been especially designed to prevent

such feats. He ran down the steps. The shower faithfully

followed him. In no corner of his hiding did the bountiful

spray neglect him. As soon as one supply of liquid

slackened another commenced. Sometimes there were two

at once. The man ran up the steps again and made another

effort to reach the safety of the street. Audrey could restrain

herself no more. She came, palpitating with joyous

vitality, towards the area gate with the innocent mien of

a passer-by.
“Whatever is the matter?” she exclaimed, stopping as

if thunderstruck. But in the gloom her eyes were dancing

fires. She was elated as she had never been.
The man only coughed.
“You oughtn’t to take shower-baths like this in the

street,” she said, veiling the laughter in her voice. “It’s

not allowed. But I suppose you’re doing it for a bet or

something.”
The downpour ceased.
“Here, miss,” said he, between coughs, “unlock this

gate for me. Here’s the key.”
“I shall do no such thing,” Audrey replied. “I believe

you’re a burglar. I shall fetch a policeman.”
And she turned back.
In the house, Miss Ingate was coming slowly down the

stairs, a fire-extinguisher in her arms, like a red baby. She

had a sardonic smile, but there was diffidence in it, which

showed, perhaps, that it was directed within.
“I’ve saved one,” she said, pointing to an extinguisher,

“in case there should be a fire in the night.”
A little later Susan Foley appeared at the door of the

living-room.
“Nine o’clock,” she announced calmly. “Supper’s

ready. We shan’t wait for Jane.”
When Jane Foley arrived, a reconnaissance proved that

the martyrised detective had contrived to get away.

CHAPTER XXIII
THE BLUE CITY
In the following month, on a Saturday afternoon, Audrey,

Miss Ingate, and Jane Foley were seated at an open-air

café in the Blue City.
The Blue City, now no more, was, as may be remembered,

Birmingham’s reply to the White City of London,

and the imitative White City of Manchester. Birmingham,

in that year, was not imitative, and, with its chemical

knowledge, it had discovered that certain shades of blue

would resist the effects of smoke far more successfully than

any shade of white. And experience even showed that these

shades of blue were improved, made more delicate and

romantic, by smoke. The total impression of the show—which

it need hardly be said was situated in the polite

Edgbaston district—was ethereal, especially when its

minarets and towers, all in accordance with the taste of the

period, were beheld from a distance. Nor was the exhibition

entirely devoted to pleasure. It had a moral object, and

that object was to demonstrate the progress of civilisation

in our islands. Its official title, indeed, was “The National

Progress Exhibition,” but the citizens of Birmingham and

the vicinity never called it anything but the Blue City.
On that Saturday afternoon a Cabinet Minister historically

hostile to the idols of Birmingham was about to

address a mass meeting in the Imperial Hall of the

Exhibition, which held seven thousand people, in order to

prove to Birmingham that the Government of which he was

a member had done far more for national progress than any

other Government had done for national progress in the same

length of time. The presence of the Cabinet Minister

accounted for the presence of Jane Foley; the presence of

Jane Foley accounted for the presence of Audrey; and the

presence of Audrey accounted for the presence of Miss

Ingate.
Although she was one of the chief organisers of victory,

and perhaps—next to Rosamund and the family trio whose

Christian names were three sweet symphonies—the principal

asset of the Suffragette Union, Jane Foley had not taken

an active part in the Union’s arrangements for suitably

welcoming the Cabinet Minister; partly because of her

lameness, partly because she was writing a book, and partly

for secret reasons which it would be unfair to divulge.

Nearly at the last moment, however, in consequence of news

that all was not well in the Midlands, she had been sent to

Birmingham, and, after evading the watch of the police, she

had arrived on the previous day in Audrey’s motor-car,

which at that moment was waiting in the automobile park

outside the principal gates of the Blue City.
The motor-car had been chosen as a means of transit

for the reason that the railway stations were being watched

for notorious suffragettes by members of a police force

whose reputations were at stake. Audrey owed her

possession of a motor-car to the fact that the Union officials

had seemed both startled and grieved when, in response to

questions, she admitted that she had no car. It was communicated

to her that members of the Union as rich as she

reputedly was were expected to own cars for the general

good. Audrey thereupon took measures to own a car.

Having seen in many newspapers an advertisement in which

a firm of middlemen implored the public thus: “Let us run

your car for you. Let us take all the worry and responsibility,”

she interviewed the firm, and by writing out a

cheque disembarrassed herself at a stroke of every anxiety

incident to defective magnetos, bad petrol, bad rubber,

punctures, driving licences, bursts, collisions, damages, and

human chauffeurs. She had all the satisfactions of owning

a car without any of the cares. One of the evidences of

progress in the Blue City was an exhibit of this very firm

of middlemen.
From the pale blue tripod table at which sat the three

women could be plainly seen the vast Imperial Hall, flanked

on one side by the great American Dragon Slide, a side-show

loudly demonstrating progress, and on the other by

the unique Joy Wheel side-show. At the doorway of the

latter a man was bawling proofs of progress through a

megaphone.
Immense crowds had been gathering in the Imperial

Hall, and the lines of political enthusiasts bound thither

were now thinning. The Blue City was full of rumours, as

that the Cabinet Minister was too afraid to come, as that

he had been smuggled to the hall inside a tea-chest, and

as that he had walked openly and unchallenged through the

whole Exhibition. It was no rumour, but a sure fact, that

two women had been caught hiding on the roof of the

Imperial Hall, under natural shelters formed by the beams

and boarding supporting the pediment of the eastern façade,

and that they were ammunitioned with flags and leaflets and

a silk ladder, and had made a hole in the roof exactly over

the platform. These two women had been seen in charge

of policemen at the Exhibition police-station. It was understood

by many that they were the last hope of militancy

that afternoon; many others, on the contrary, were convinced

that they had been simply a feint.
“Well,” said Miss Ingate suddenly, glancing up at the

Imperial clock, “I think I shall move outside and sit in the

car. I think that’ll be the best place for me. I said that

night in Paris that I’d get my arm broken, but I’ve changed

my mind about that.” She rose.
“Winnie,” protested Audrey, “aren’t you going to see

it out?”
“No,” said Miss Ingate.
“Are you afraid?”
“I don’t know that I’m afraid. I played the barrel

organ all the way down Regent Street, and it was smashed

to pieces. But I don’t want to go to prison. Really, I

don’t want to. If me going to prison would bring the Vote

a single year nearer, I should say: ‘Let it wait a year.’ If

me not going to prison meant no Vote for ever and ever, I

should say: ‘Well, struggle on without the Vote.’ I’ve no

objection to other people going to prison, if it suits them,

but it wouldn’t suit me. I know it wouldn’t. So I shall

go outside and sit in the car. If you don’t come, I shall

know what’s happened, and you needn’t worry about me.”
The dame duly departed, her lips and eyes equally ironic

about her own prudence and about the rashness of others.
“Let’s have some more lemonade—shall we?” said

Jane Foley.
“Oh, let’s!” agreed Audrey, with rapture. “And more

sponge-cake, too! You do look lovely like that!”
“Do I?”
Jane Foley had her profuse hair tightly bound round her

head and powdered grey. It was very advisable for her

to be disguised, and her bright hair was usually the chief

symptom of her in those disturbances which so harassed

the police. She now had the appearance of a neat old lady

kept miraculously young by a pure and cheerful nature.

Audrey, with a plain blue frock and hat which had cost

more than Jane Foley would spend on clothes in twelve

months, had a face dazzling by its ingenuous excitement

and expectation. Her little nose was extraordinarily pert;

her forehead superb; and all her gestures had the same

vivacious charm as was in her eyes. The white-aproned,

streamered girl who took the order for lemonade and

sponge-cakes to a covered bar ornamented by advertisements

of whisky, determined to adopt a composite of the

styles of both the customers on her next ceremonious

Sunday. And a large proportion of the other sippers and

nibblers and of the endless promenading crowds regarded

the pair with pleasure and curiosity, never suspecting that

one of them was the most dangerous woman in England.
The new refreshments, which had been delayed by

reason of an altercation between the waitress and three

extreme youths at a neighbouring table, at last arrived,

and were plopped smartly down between Audrey and Miss

Foley. Having received half a sovereign from Audrey, the

girl returned to the bar for change. “None o’ your sauce!”

she threw out, as she passed the youths, who had

apparently discovered new arguments in support of their

case. Audrey was fired by the vigorous independence of the

girl against three males.
“I don’t care if we are caught!” she murmured low,

looking for the future through the pellucid tumbler. She

added, however: “But if we are, I shall pay my own fine.

You know I promised that to Miss Ingate.”
“That’s all right, so long as you don’t pay mine, my

dear,” said Jane Foley with an affectionate smile.
“Jenny!” Audrey protested, full of heroine-worship.

“How could you think I would ever do such a mean thing!”
There came a dull, vague, voluminous sound from the

direction of the Imperial Hall. It lasted for quite a number

of seconds.
“He’s beginning,” said Jane Foley. “I do feel sorry

for him.”
“Are we to start now?” Audrey asked deferentially.
“Oh, no!” Jane laughed. “The great thing is to let

them think everything’s all right. And then, when they’re

getting careless, let go at them full bang with a beautiful

surprise. There’ll be a chance of getting away like that.

I believe there are a hundred and fifty stewards in the meeting,

and they’ll every one be quite useless.”
At intervals a muffled roar issued from the Imperial

Hall, despite the fact that the windows were closely shut.
In due time Jane Foley quietly rose from the table, and

Audrey did likewise. All around them stretched the imposing

blue architecture of the Exhibition, forming vistas

that ended dimly either in the smoke of Birmingham or the

rustic haze of Worcestershire. And, although the Imperial

Hall was crammed, every vista was thickly powdered with

pleasure-seekers and probably pleasure-finders. Bands

played. Flags waved. Brass glinted. Even the sun

feebly shone at intervals through the eternal canopy of

soot. It was a great day in the annals of the Blue City

and of Liberalism.
And Jane Foley and Audrey turned their backs upon all

that, and—Jane concealing her limp as much as possible—sauntered

with affected nonchalance towards the precincts

of the Joy Wheel enclosure. Audrey was inexpressibly uplifted.

She felt as if she had stepped straight into romance.

And she was right—she had stepped into the most vivid

romance of the modern age, into a world of disguises,

flights, pursuits, chicane, inconceivable adventures, ideals,

martyrs and conquerors, which only the Renaissance or the

twenty-first century could appreciate.
“Lend me that, will you?” said Jane persuasively to

the man with the megaphone at the entrance to the enclosure.
He was, quite properly, a very loud man, with a loud

thick voice, a loud purple face, and a loud grey suit. To

Audrey’s astonishment, he smiled and winked, and gave up

the megaphone at once.
Audrey paid sixpence at the turnstile, admittance for two

persons, and they were within the temple, which had a

roof like an umbrella over the central, revolving portion of

it, but which was somewhat open to the skies around the

rim. There were two concentric enclosing walls, the inner

one was unscalable, and the outer one about five feet six

inches high. A second loud man was calling out:

“Couples please. Ladies and gentlemen. Couples if you please.” Obediently, numbers of the crowd disposed themselves

in pairs in the attitudes of close affection on the

circling floor which had just come to rest, while the

remainder of the numerous gathering gazed upon them with

sarcastic ecstasy. Then the wheel began slowly to turn,

and girls to shriek in the plenitude of happiness. And

progress was proved geometrically.
Jane, bearing the megaphone, slipped by an aperture

into the space between the two walls, and Audrey followed.

Nobody gave attention to them except the second loud man,

who winked the wink of knowledge. The fact was that

both the loud men, being unalterable Tories, had been very

willing to connive at Jane Foley’s scheme for the affliction

of a Radical Minister.
The two girls over the wall had an excellent and

appetising view of the upper part of the side of the Imperial

Hall, and of its high windows, the nearest of which was

scarcely thirty feet away.
“Hold this, will you?” said Jane, handing the megaphone

to Audrey.
Jane drew from its concealment in her dress a small

piece of iron to which was attached a coloured streamer

bearing certain words. She threw, with a strong movement

of the left arm, because she was left-handed. She

had practised throwing; throwing was one of her several

specialties. The bit of iron, trailing its motto like a comet

its tail, flew across space and plumped into the window

with a pleasing crash and disappeared, having triumphed

over uncounted police on the outskirts and a hundred and

fifty stewards within. A roar from the interior of the hall

supervened, and varied cries.
“Give me the meg,” said Jane gently.
The next instant she was shouting through the megaphone,

an instrument which she had seriously studied:
“Votes for women. Why do you torture women?

Votes for women. Why do you torture women?”
The uproar increased and subsided. A masterful voice

resounded within the interior. Many people rushed out of

the hall. And there was a great scurry of important and

puzzled feet within a radius of a score of yards.
“I think I’ll try the next window,” said Jane, handing

over the megaphone. “You shout while I throw.”
Audrey’s heart was violently beating. She took the

megaphone and put it to her lips, but no sound would come.

Then, as though it were breaking through an obstacle, the

sound shot forth, and to Audrey it was a gigantic voice

that functioned quite independently of her will. Tremendously

excited by the noise, she bawled louder and still

louder.
“I’ve missed,” said Jane calmly in her ear. “That’s

enough, I think. Come along.”
“But they can’t possibly see us,” said Audrey, breathless,

lowering the instrument.
“Come along, dear,” Jane Foley insisted.
People with open mouths were crowding at the aperture

of the inner wall, but, Jane going first, both girls pushed

safely through the throng. The wheel had stopped. The

entire congregation was staring agog, and in two seconds

everybody divined, or had been nudged to the effect, that

Jane and Audrey were the authoresses of the pother.
Jane still leading, they made for the exit. But the first

loud man rushed chivalrously in.
“Perlice!” he cried. “Two bobbies a-coming.”
“Here!” said the second loud man. “Here, misses.

Get on the wheel. They’ll never get ye if ye sit in the

middle back to back.” He jumped on to the wheel himself,

and indicated the mathematical centre. Jane took the suggestion

in a flash; Audrey was obedient. They fixed themselves

under directions, dropping the megaphone. The

wheel started, and the megaphone rattled across its smooth

surface till it was shot off. A policeman ran in, and hesitated;

another man, in plain clothes, and wearing a rosette,

ran in.
“That’s them,” said the rosette. “I saw her with the

grey hair from the gallery.”
The policeman sprang on to the wheel, and after terrific

efforts fell sprawling and was thrown off. The rosette met

the same destiny. A second policeman appeared, and with

the fearless courage of his cloth, undeterred by the spectacle

of prostrate forms, made a magnificent dash, and was

equally floored.
As Audrey sat very upright, pressing her back against

the back of Jane Foley and clutching at Jane Foley’s skirts

with her hands behind her—the locked pair were obliged thus

to hold themselves exactly over the axis of the wheel, for

the slightest change of position would have resulted in their

being flung to the circumference and into the blue grip of

the law—she had visions of all her life just as though she

had been drowning. She admitted all her follies and

wondered what madness could have prompted her remarkable

escapades both in Paris and out of it. She remembered

Madame Piriac’s prophecy. She was ready to wish

the past year annihilated and herself back once more in

parental captivity at Moze, the slave of an unalterable

routine imposed by her father, without responsibility, without

initiative and without joy. And she lived again through

the scenes in which she had smiled at the customs official,

fibbed to Rosamund, taken the wounded Musa home in the

taxi, spoken privily with the ageing yacht-owner, and

laughed at the drowned detective in the area of the palace

in Paget Gardens.
Everything happened in her mind while the wheel went

round once, showing her in turn to the various portions

of the audience, and bringing her at length to a second view

of the sprawling policemen. Whereupon she thought

queerly: “What do I care about the vote, really?” And

finally she thought with anger and resentment: “What a

shame it is that women haven’t got the vote!” And then

she heard a gay, quiet sound. It was Jane Foley laughing

gently behind her.
“Can you see the big one now, darling?” asked Jane

roguishly. “Has he picked himself up again?”
Audrey laughed.
And at last the audience laughed also. It laughed

because the big policeman, unconquerable, had made

another intrepid dash for the centre of the wheel and fallen

upon his stomach as upon a huge india-rubber ball. The

audience did more than laugh—it shrieked, yelled, and

guffawed. The performance to be witnessed was worth ten

times the price of entry. Indeed no such performance had

ever before been seen in the whole history of popular amusement.

And in describing the affair the next morning as

“unique” the Birmingham Daily Post for once used that

adjective with absolute correctness. The policemen tried

again and yet again. They got within feet, within inches,

of their prey, only to be dragged away by the mysterious

protector of militant maidens—centrifugal force. Probably

never before in the annals of the struggle for political

freedom had maidens found such a protection, invisible,

sinister and complete. Had the education of policemen in

England included a course of mechanics, these particular

two policemen would have known that they were seeking

the impossible and fighting against that which was stronger

than ten thousand policemen. But they would not give up.

At each fresh attempt they hoped by guile to overcome their

unseen enemy, as the gambler hopes at each fresh throw to

outwit chance. The jeers of the audience pricked them to

desperation, for in encounters with females like Jane Foley

and Audrey they had been accustomed to the active

sympathy of the public. But centrifugal force had

rendered them ridiculous, and the public never sympathises

with those whom ridicule has covered. The strange and side-splitting

effects of centrifugal force had transformed about a

hundred indifferent young men and women into ardent and

convinced supporters of feminism in its most advanced form.
In the course of her slow revolution Audrey saw the

rosetted steward arguing with the second loud man, no

doubt to persuade him to stop the wheel. Then out of the

tail of her eye she saw the steward run violently from the

tent. And then while her back was towards the entrance

she was deafened by a prodigious roar of delight from the

mob. The two policemen had fled also—probably for reinforcements

and appliances against centrifugal force. In

their pardonable excitement they had, however, committed

the imprudence of departing together. An elementary

knowledge of strategy should have warned them against

such a mistake. The wheel stopped immediately. The

second loud man beckoned with laughter to Jane Foley and

Audrey, who rose and hopefully skipped towards him.

Audrey at any rate was as self-conscious as though she had

been on the stage.
“Here’s th’ back way,” said the second loud man,

pointing to a coarse curtain in the obscurity of the nether

parts of the enclosure.
They ran, Jane Foley first, and vanished from the

regions of the Joy Wheel amid terrific acclamations given

in a strong Midland accent.
The next moment they found themselves in a part of

the Blue City which nobody had taken the trouble to paint

blue. The one blue object was a small patch of sky, amid

clouds, overhead. On all sides were wooden flying

buttresses, supporting the boundaries of the Joy Wheel

enclosure to the south-east, of the Parade Restaurant and

Bar to the south-west, and of a third establishment of good

cheer to the north. Upon the ground were brick-ends,

cinders, bits of wood, bits of corrugated iron, and all the

litter and refuse cast out of sight of the eyes of visitors to

the Exhibition of Progress.
With the fear of the police behind them they stumbled

forward a few yards, and then saw a small ramshackle

door swinging slightly to and fro on one hinge. Jane Foley

pulled it open. They both went into a narrow passage.

On the mildewed wall of the passage was pinned up a notice

in red ink: “Any waitress taking away any apron or cap

from the Parade Restaurant and Bar will be fined one

shilling.” Farther on was another door, also ajar. Jane

Foley pushed against it, and a tiny room of irregular shape

was disclosed. In this room a stout woman in grey was

counting a pile of newly laundered caps and aprons, and

putting them out of one hamper into another. Audrey

remembered seeing the woman at the counter of the

restaurant and bar.
“The police are after us. They’ll be here in a minute,”

said Jane Foley simply.
“Oh!” exclaimed the woman in grey, with the carelessness

of fatigue. “Are you them stone-throwing lot?

They’ve just been in to tell me about it. What d’ye do

it for?”
“We do it for you—amongst others,” Jane Foley smiled.
“Nay! That ye don’t!” said the woman positively.

“I’ve got a vote for the city council, and I want no more.”
“Well, you don’t want us to get caught, do you?”
“No, I don’t know as I do. Ye look a couple o’ bonny

wenches.”
“Let’s have two caps and aprons, then,” said Jane

Foley smoothly. “We’ll pay the shilling fine.” She

laughed lightly. “And a bit more. If the police get in

here we shall have to struggle, you know, and they’ll break

the place up.”
Audrey produced another half-sovereign.
“But what shall ye do with yer hats and coats?” the

woman demanded.
“Give them to you, of course.”
The woman regarded the hats and coats.
“I couldn’t get near them coats,” she said. “And if I

put on one o’ them there hats my old man ’ud rise from the

grave—that he would. Still, I don’t wish ye any harm.”
She shut and locked the door.
In about a minute two waitresses in aprons and

streamered caps of immaculate purity emerged from the

secret places of the Parade Restaurant and Bar, slipped

round the end of the counter, and started with easy indifference

to saunter away into the grounds after the manner

of restaurant girls who have been gifted with half an hour

off. The tabled expanse in front of the Parade erection was

busy with people, some sitting at the tables and supporting

the establishment, but many more merely taking advantage

of the pitch to observe all possible exciting developments of

the suffragette shindy.
And as the criminals were modestly getting clear, a loud

and imperious voice called:
“Hey!”
Audrey, lacking experience, hesitated.
“Hey there!”
They both turned, for the voice would not be denied.

It belonged to a man sitting with another man at a table

on the outskirts of the group of tables. It was the voice

of the rosetted steward, who beckoned in a not unfriendly

style.
“Bring us two liqueur brandies, miss,” he cried. “And

look slippy, if ye please.”
The sharp tone, so sure of obedience, gave Audrey a

queer sensation of being in reality a waitress doomed to

tolerate the rough bullying of gentlemen urgently desiring

alcohol. And the fierce thought that women—especially

restaurant waitresses—must and should possess the Vote

surged through her mind more powerfully than ever.
“I’ll never have the chance again,” she muttered to herself.

And marched to the counter.
“Two liqueur brandies, please,” she said to the woman

in grey, who had left her apron calculations. “That’s all

right,” she murmured, as the woman stared a question at

her. Then the woman smiled to herself, and poured out

the liqueur brandies from a labelled bottle with startling

adroitness, and dashed the full glasses on to a brass tray.
As Audrey walked across the gravel carefully balancing

the tray, she speculated whether the public eye would notice

the shape of her small handbag, which was attached by a

safety pin to her dress beneath the apron, and whether her

streamers were streaming out far behind her head.
Before she could put the tray down on the table, the

rosetted steward, who looked pale, snatched one of the

glasses and gulped down its entire contents.
“I wanted it!” said he, smacking his lips. “I wanted

it bad. They’ll catch ’em all right. I should know the

young ’un again anywhere. I’ll swear to identify her in

any court. And I will. Tasty little piece o’ goods, too! ...

But not so good-looking as you,” he added, gazing

suddenly at Audrey.
“None o’ your sauce,” snapped Audrey, and walked off,

leaving the tray behind.
The two men exploded into coarse but amiable laughter,

and called to her to return, but she would not. “You can

pay the other young lady,” she said over her shoulder,

pointing vaguely to the counter where there was now a

bevy of other young ladies.
Five minutes later Miss Ingate, and the chauffeur also,

received a very appreciable shock. Half an hour later the

car, having called at the telegraph office, and also at the

aghast lodgings of the waitresses to enable them to reattire

and to pack, had quitted Birmingham.
That night they reached Northampton. At the post

office there Jane Foley got a telegram. And when the three

were seated in a corner of the curtained and stuffy dining-room

of the small hotel, Jane said, addressing herself

specially to Audrey:
“It won’t be safe for us to return to Paget Gardens

to-morrow. And perhaps not to any of our places in

London.”
“That won’t matter,” said Audrey, who was now

becoming accustomed to the world of conspiracy and

chicane in which Jane Foley carried on her existence with

such a deceiving air of the matter-of-fact. “We’ll go anywhere,

won’t we, Winnie?”
And Miss Ingate assented.
“Well,” said Jane Foley. “I’ve just had a telegram

arranging for us to go to Frinton.”
“You don’t mean Frinton-on-Sea?” exclaimed Miss

Ingate, suddenly excited.
“It is on the sea,” said Jane. “We have to go

through Colchester. Do you know it?”
“Do I know it!” repeated Miss Ingate. “I know

everybody in Frinton, except the Germans. When I’m at

home I buy my bacon at Frinton. Are you going to an

hotel there?”
“No,” said Jane. “To some people named Spatt.”
“There’s nobody that is anybody named Spatt living at

Frinton,” said Miss Ingate.
“They haven’t been there long.”
“Oh!” murmured Miss Ingate. “Of course if that’s

it...! I can’t guarantee what’s happened since I began

my pilgrimages. But I think I shall wriggle off home

quietly as soon as we get to Colchester. This afternoon’s

business has been too feverish for me. When the policeman

held up his hand as we came through Ellsworth I thought

you were caught. I shall just go home.”
“I don’t care much about going to Frinton, Jenny,” said

Audrey.
Indeed, Moze lay within not many miles of Frinton-on-Sea.
Then Audrey and Miss Ingate observed a phenomenon

that was both novel and extremely disturbing. Tears came

into the eyes of Jane Foley.
“Don’t say it, Audrey, don’t say it!” she appealed in

a wet voice. “I shall have to go myself. And you simply

can’t imagine how I hate going all alone into these houses

that we’re invited to. I’d much sooner be in lodgings, as

we were last night. But these homes in quiet places here

and there are very useful sometimes. They all belong to

members of the Union, you know; and we have to use them.

But I wish we hadn’t. I’ve met Mrs. Spatt once. I didn’t

think you’d throw me over just at the worst part. The

Spatts will take all of us and be glad.”
("They won’t take me,” said Miss Ingate under her

breath.)
“I shall come with you,” said Audrey, caressing the

recreant who, while equal to trifles such as policemen, magistrates,

and prisons, was miserably afraid of a strange

home. In fact Audrey now liked Jane much more than

ever, liked her completely—and perhaps admired her rather

less, though her admiration was still intense. And the

thought in Audrey’s mind was: “Never will I desert this

girl! I’m a militant, too, now, and I shall stick by her.”

And she was full of a happiness which she could not understand

and which she did not want to understand.
The next morning all the newspaper posters in Northhampton

bore the words: “Policemen and suffragettes on

Joy Wheel,” or some variation of these words. And they

bore nothing else. And in all the towns and many of the

villages through which they passed on the way to Colchester,

the same legend greeted their flying eyes. Audrey

and Miss Ingate, in the motor-car, read with great care all

the papers. Audrey blushed at the descriptions of herself,

which were flattering. It seemed that the Cabinet Minister’s

political meeting had been seriously damaged by the episode,

for the reason that rumours of the performance on the Joy

Wheel had impaired the spell of eloquence and partially

emptied the hall. And this was the more disappointing in

that the police had been sure that nothing untoward would

occur. It seemed also that the police were on the track of

the criminals.
“Are they!” exclaimed Jane Foley with a beautiful

smile.
Then the car approached a city of towers on a hill, and

as it passed by the station, which was in the valley, Miss

Ingate demanded a halt. She got out in the station yard

and transferred her belongings to a cab.
“I shall drive home from here,” she said. “I’ve often

done it before. After all, I did play the barrel organ all

the way down Regent Street. Surely I can rest on the

barrel organ, can’t I, Miss Foley—at my age? ... What

a business I shall have when I do get home, and nobody

expecting me!”
And when certain minor arrangements had been made,

the car mounted the hill into Colchester and took the

Frinton road, leaving Miss Ingate’s fly far behind.

CHAPTER XXIV
THE SPATTS
The house of the Spatts was large, imposing and variegated.

It had turrets, balconies, and architectural nooks in such

quantity that the unaided individual eye could not embrace

it all at once. It overlooked, from a height, the grounds

of the Frinton Sports Club, and a new member of this club,

upon first beholding the residence, had made the immortal

remark: “It wants at least fourteen people to look at it.”

The house stood in the middle of an unfinished garden,

which promised ultimately to be as heterogeneous as itself,

but which at present was merely an expanse of sorely

wounded earth.
The time was early summer, and therefore the summer

dining-room of the Spatts was in use. This dining-room

consisted of one white, windowed wall, a tiled floor, and a

roof of wood. The windows gave into the winter dining-room,

which was a white apartment, sparsely curtained and

cushioned with chintz, and containing very few pieces of

furniture or pictures. The Spatts considered, rightly, that

furniture and pictures were unhygienic and the secret lairs

of noxious germs. Had the Spatts flourished twenty-five years

earlier their dining-room would have been covered with

brown paper upon which would have hung permanent photographs

of European masterpieces of graphic art, and there

would have been a multiplicity of draperies and specimens

of battered antique furniture, with a warming-pan or so

suspended here and there in place of sporting trophies. But

the Spatts had not begun to flourish twenty-five years ago.

They flourished very few years ago and they still flourish.
As the summer dining-room had only one wall, it follows

that it was open to the powers of the air. This result had

been foreseen by the Spatts—had indeed been expressly

arranged, for they believed strongly in the powers of the

air, as being beneficent powers. It is true that they generally

had sniffling colds, but their argument was that these

maladies had no connection whatever with the powers of the

air, which, according to their theory, saved them from

much worse.
They and their guests were now seated at dinner.

Twilight was almost lost in night. The table was

illuminated by four candles at the corners, and flames of

these candles flickered in the healthful evening breeze,

dropping pink wax on the candlesticks. They were surrounded

by the mortal remains of tiny moths, but other

tiny moths would not heed the warning and continually shot

themselves into the flames. On the outskirts of the table

moved with silent stealth the forms of two middle-aged and

ugly servants.
Mrs. Spatt was very tall and very thin, and the

simplicity of her pale green dress—sole reminder of the

brown-paper past—was calculated to draw attention to these

attributes. She had an important reddish nose, and a

mysterious look of secret confidence, which never left her

even in the most trying crises. Mr. Spatt also was very

tall and very thin. His head was several sizes too small,

and part of his insignificant face, which one was apt to miss

altogether in contemplating his body, was hidden under a

short grey beard. Siegfried Spatt, the sole child of the

union, though but seventeen, was as tall and as thin as his

father and his mother; he had a pale face and red hands.
The guests were Audrey, Jane Foley, and a young

rubicund gentleman, beautifully clothed, and with fair

curly locks, named Ziegler. Mr. Ziegler was far more perfectly

at ease than anybody else at the table, which indeed

as a whole was rendered haggard and nervous by the precarious

state of the conversation, expecting its total

decease at any moment. At intervals someone lifted the

limp dying body—it sank back—was lifted again—struggled

feebly—relapsed. Young Siegfried was excessively tongue-tied

and self-conscious, and his demeanour frankly admitted

it. Jane Foley, acknowledged heroine in certain fields, sat

like a schoolgirl at her first dinner-party. Audrey maintained

her widowhood, but scarcely with credit. Mr. and

Mrs. Spatt were as usual too deeply concerned about the

awful condition of the universe to display that elasticity of

mood which continuous chatter about nothing in particular

demands. And they were too worshipful of the best London

conventions not to regard silence at table as appalling. In

the part of the country from which Jane Foley sprang, hosts

will sit mute through a meal and think naught of it. But

Mr. and Mrs. Spatt were of different stuff. All these five

appeared to be in serious need of conversation pills. Only

Mr. Ziegler beheld his companions with a satisfied equanimity

that was insensible to spiritual suffering. Happily at the

most acute moments the gentle night wind, meandering

slowly from the east across leagues of North Sea, would

induce in one or another a sneeze which gave some semblance

of vitality and vigour to the scene.
After one of these sneezes it was that Jane Foley,

conscience-stricken, tried to stimulate the exchanges by an

effort of her own.
“And what are the folks like in Frinton?” she demanded,

blushing, and looking up. As she looked up young Siegfried

looked down, lest he might encounter her glance and be

utterly discountenanced.
Jane Foley’s question was unfortunate.
“We know nothing of them,” said Mrs. Spatt, pained.

“Of course I have received and paid a few purely formal

calls. But as regards friends and acquaintances, we prefer

to import them from London. As for the holiday-makers,

one sees them, naturally. They appear to lead an exclusively

physical existence.”
“My dear,” put in Mr. Spatt stiffly. “The residents

are no better. The women play golf all day on that

appalling golf course, and then after tea they go into the

town to change their library books. But I do not believe

that they ever read their library books. The mentality of

the town is truly remarkable. However, I am informed

that there are many towns like it.”
“You bet!” murmured Siegfried Spatt, and then tried,

vainly, to suck back the awful remark whence it had come.
Mr. Ziegler, speaking without passion or sorrow, added

his views about Frinton. He asserted that it was the worst

example of stupid waste of opportunities he had ever encountered,

even in England. He pointed out that there

was no band, no pier, no casino, no shelters—and not even

a tree; and that there were no rules to govern the place.

He finished by remarking that no German state would

tolerate such a pleasure resort. In this judgment he

employed an excellent English accent, with a scarcely perceptible

thickening of the t’s and thinning of the d’s.
Mr. Ziegler left nothing to be said.
Then the conversation sighed and really did expire. It

might have survived had not the Spatts had a rule, explained

previously to those whom it concerned, against

talking shop. Their attachment to this rule was heroic.

In the present instance shop was suffragism. The Spatts

had developed into supporters of militancy in a very

curious way. Mrs. Spatt’s sister, a widow, had been

mixed up with the Union for years. One day she was fined

forty shillings or a week’s imprisonment for a political

peccadillo involving a hatpin and a policeman. It was useless

for her to remind the magistrate that she, like Mrs.

Spatt, was the daughter of the celebrated statesman B——,

who in the fifties had done so much for Britain. (Lo!

The source of that mysterious confidence that always supported

Mrs. Spatt!) The magistrate had no historic sense.

She went to prison. At least she was on the way thither

when Mr. Spatt paid the fine in spite of her. The same

night Mr. Spatt wrote to his favourite evening paper to

point out the despicable ingratitude of a country which would

have imprisoned a daughter of the celebrated B——, and

announced that henceforward he would be an active supporter

of suffragism, which hitherto had interested him only

academically. He was a wealthy man, and his money and

his house and his pen were at the service of the Union—but

always with discretion.
Audrey and Jane Foley had learnt all this privately from

Mrs. Spatt on their arrival, after they had told such part

of their tale as Jane Foley had deemed suitable, and they

had further learnt that suffragism would not be a welcome

topic at their table, partly on account of the servants and

partly on account of Mr. Ziegler, whose opinions were quite

clearly opposed to the movement, but whom they admired

for true and rare culture. He was a cousin of German

residents in First Avenue and, visiting them often,

had been discovered by Mr. Spatt in the afternoon-tea

train.
And just as the ices came to compete with the night

wind, the postman arrived like a deliverer. The postman

had to pass the dining-room en route by the circuitous drive

to the front door, and when dinner was afoot he would

hand the letters to the parlourmaid, who would divide

them into two portions, and, putting both on a salver,

offer the salver first to Mrs. and then to Mr. Spatt, while

Mr. or Mrs. Spatt begged guests, if there were any, to

excuse the quaint and indeed unusual custom, pardonable

only on the plea that any tidings from London ought to be

savoured instantly in such a place as Frinton.
After leaving his little pile untouched for some time,

Mr. Spatt took advantage of the diversion caused by the

brushing of the cloth and the distribution of finger-bowls to

glance at the topmost letter, which was addressed in a

woman’s hand.
“She’s coming!” he exclaimed, forgetting to apologise

in the sudden excitement of news, “Good heavens!” He

looked at his watch. “She’s here. I heard the train

several minutes ago! She must be here! The letter’s

been delayed.”
“Who, Alroy?” demanded Mrs. Spatt earnestly. “Not

that Miss Nickall you mentioned?”
“Yes, my dove.” And then in a grave tone to the

parlourmaid: “Give this letter to your mistress.”
Mr. Spatt, cheered by the new opportunity for conversation,

and in his eagerness abrogating all rules, explained

how he had been in London on the previous day for a performance

of Strauss’s Elektra, and according to his custom

had called at the offices of the Suffragette Union to see

whether he could in any manner aid the cause. He had

been told that a house in Paget Gardens lent to the Union

had been basely withdrawn from service by its owner on

account of some embroilment with the supreme police

authorities at Scotland Yard, and that one of the inmates,

a Miss Nickall, the poor young lady who had had her arm

broken and was scarcely convalescent, had need of quietude

and sea air. Mr. Spatt had instantly offered the hospitality

of his home to Miss Nickall, whom he had seen in a cab

and who was very sweet. Miss Nickall had said that she

must consult her companion. It now appeared that the companion

was gone to the Midlands. This episode had

occurred immediately before the receipt of the telegram from

head-quarters asking for shelter for Miss Jane Foley and

Mrs. Moncreiff.
Mr. Spatt’s excitement had now communicated itself

to everybody except Mr. Ziegler and Siegfried Spatt. Jane

Foley almost recovered her presence of mind, and Mrs.

Spatt was extraordinarily interested to learn that Miss

Nickall was an American painter who had lived long in

Paris, and that Audrey had first made her acquaintance in

Paris, and knew Paris well. Audrey’s motor-car had produced

a considerable impression on Aurora Spatt, and this

impression was deepened by the touch about Paris. After

breathing mysterious orders into the ear of the parlourmaid

Mrs. Spatt began to talk at large about music in

Paris, and Mr. Spatt made comparisons between the principal

opera houses in Europe. He proclaimed for the Scala at

Milan; but Mr. Ziegler, who had methodically according to

a fixed plan lived in all European capitals except Paris—whither

he was soon going, said that Mr. Spatt was quite

wrong, and that Milan could not hold a candle to Munich.

Mrs. Spatt inquired whether Audrey had heard Strauss’s

Elektra at the Paris Opera House. Audrey replied that

Strauss’s Elektra had not been given at the Paris Opera

House.
“Oh!” said Mrs. Spatt. “This prejudice against the

greatest modern masterpieces because they are German is

a very sad sign in Paris. I have noticed it for a long

time.”
Audrey, who most irrationally had begun to be annoyed

by the blandness of Mr. Ziegler’s smile, answered with a

rival blandness:
“In Paris they do not reproach Strauss because he is

German, but because he is vulgar.”
Mrs. Spatt had a martyrised expression. In her heart

she felt a sick trembling of her religious belief that Elektra

was the greatest opera ever composed. For Audrey had the

prestige of Paris and of the automobile. Mrs. Spatt, however,

said not a word. Mr. Ziegler, on the other hand,

after shuffling some seconds for utterance, ejaculated with

sublime anger:
“Vulgar!”
His rubicundity had increased and his blandness was

dissolved. A terrible sequel might have occurred, had not

the crunch of wheels on the drive been heard at that very

instant. The huge, dim form of a coach drawn by a ghostly

horse passed along towards the front door, just below the

diners. Almost simultaneously the electric light above the

front door was turned on, casting a glare across a section

of the inchoate garden, where no flower grew save the

dandelion. Everybody sprang up. Host and hostess,

urged by hospitality, spun first into the drive, and came

level with the vehicle precisely as the vehicle opened its

invisible interior. Jane Foley and Audrey saw Miss Nickall

emerge from it rather slowly and cautiously, with her white

kind face and her arm all swathed in white.
“Well, Mr. Spatt,” came the American benevolent

voice of Nick. “How glad I am to see you. And this is

Mrs. Spatt? Mrs. Spatt! Delighted. Your husband is

the kindest, sweetest man, Mrs. Spatt, that I’ve met in

years. It is perfectly sweet of you to have me. I shouldn’t

have inflicted myself on you—no, I shouldn’t—only you

know we have to obey orders. I was told to come here,

and here I’ve come, with a glad heart.”
Audrey was touched by the sight and voice of grey-haired

Nick, with her trick of seeing nothing but the best

in everybody, transforming everybody into saints, angels,

and geniuses. Her smiles and her tones were irresistible.

They were like the wand of some magical princess come to

break a sinister thrall. They nearly humanised the gaunt

parlourmaid, who stood grimly and primly waiting until

these tedious sentimental preliminaries should cease from

interfering with her duties in regard to the luggage.
“We have friends of yours here, Miss Nickall,”

simpered Mrs. Spatt, after she had given a welcome. She

had seen Jane Foley and Audrey standing expectant just

behind Mr. Spatt, and outside the field of the electric beam.
Nick glanced round, hesitated, and then with a sudden

change of all her features rushed at the girls regardless

of her arm. Her joy was enchanting.
“I was afraid—I was afraid——” she murmured as she

kissed them. Her eyes softly glistened.
“Oh!” she exclaimed, after a moment. “And I have

got a surprise for you! I have just! You may say it’s

some surprise.” She turned towards the cab. “Musa,

now do come out of that wagon.”
And from the blackness of the cab’s interior gingerly

stepped Musa, holding a violin case in his hand.
“Mrs. Spatt,” said Nick. “Let me introduce Mr. Musa.

Mr. Musa is perhaps the greatest violinist in Paris—or

in Europe. Very old friend of ours. He came over to

London unexpectedly just as I was starting for Liverpool

Street station this afternoon. So I did the only thing

I could do. I couldn’t leave him there—I brought him

along, and we want Mr. Spatt to recommend us an hotel

in Frinton for him.” And while Musa was shyly in his

imperfect English greeting Mr. and Mrs. Spatt, she whispered

to Audrey: “You don’t know. You’d never guess.

A big concert agent in Paris has taken him up at last.

He’s going to play at a lot of concerts, and they actually

paid him two thousand five hundred francs in advance.

Isn’t it a perfect dream?”
Audrey, who had seen Musa’s trustful glance at Nick

as he descended from the cab, was suddenly aware of

a fierce pang of hate for the benignant Nick, and a

wave of fury against Musa. The thing was very disconcerting.
After self-conscious greetings, Musa almost dragged

Audrey away from the others.
“It’s you I came to London to see,” he muttered in

an unusual voice.

CHAPTER XXV
THE MUTE
It was upon this evening that Audrey began alarmingly

to develop the quality of being incomprehensible—even to

herself. Like most young women and men, she had been

convinced from an early age that she was mysteriously

unlike all other created beings, and—again like most young

men and women—she could find, in the secrecy of her

own heart, plenty of proof of a unique strangeness. But

now her unreason became formidable. There she sat with

her striking forehead and her quite unimportant nose, in

the large austere drawing-room of the Spatts, which was

so pervaded by artistic chintz that the slightest movement

in it produced a crackle—and wondered why she was so

much queerer than other girls could possibly be.
Neither the crackling of chintz nor the aspect of the

faces in the drawing-room was conducive to clear psychological

analysis. Mr. Ziegler, with a glass of Pilsener

by his side on a small table and a cigar in his richly

jewelled hand, reposed with crossed legs in an easy chair.

He had utterly recovered from the momentary irritation

caused by Audrey’s attack on Strauss, and his perfect

beaming satisfaction with himself made a spectacle which

would have distracted an Indian saint from the contemplation

of eternity and nothingness. Mr. and Mrs. Spatt,

seated as far as was convenient from one another on a

long sofa, their emaciated bodies very upright and alert,

gazed with intense expectation at Musa. Musa stood in

the middle of the room, tuning his violin with little twangs

and listening to the twangs as to a secret message.
Miss Nickall, being an invalid, had excusably gone to

bed, and Jane Foley, sharer of her bedroom, had followed.

The happy relief on Jane’s face as she said good night

to her hosts had testified to the severity of the ordeal of

hospitality through which she had so heroically passed.

She might have been going out of prison instead of going

out of the most intellectual drawing-room in Frinton.
Audrey, too, would have liked to retire, for automobiles

and sensations had exhausted her; but just at this point

her unreason had begun to operate. She would not leave

Musa alone, because Miss Nickall was leaving him alone.

Yet she did not feel at all benevolent towards Musa. She

was angry with him for having quitted Paris. She was

angry with him for having said to her, in such a peculiar

tone: “It’s you I came to London to see.” She was angry

with him for not having found an opportunity, during the

picnic meal provided for the two new-comers after the

regular dinner, to explain why he had come to London

to see her. She was angry with him for that dark hostility

which he had at once displayed towards Mr. Ziegler,

though she herself hated the innocent Mr. Ziegler with

the ferocity of a woman of the Revolution. And further,

she was glad, ridiculously glad, that Musa had come to

London to see her. Lastly she was aware of a most

irrational objection to the manner in which Miss Nickall

and Musa said good night to one another, and the obvious

fact that Musa in less than an hour had reached terms of

familiarity with Jane Foley.
She thought:
“I haven’t the faintest idea why he has given up his

practising in Paris to come to see me. But if it is what

I feel sure it is, there will be trouble.... Why do I

stay in this ghastly drawing-room? I am dying to go to

sleep, and I simply detest everybody in the room. I detest

Musa more than all, because as usual he has been acting

like a child.... Why can’t you smile at him, Audrey

Moze? Why frown and pretend you’re cross when you

know you aren’t, Audrey Moze? ... I am cross, and

he shall suffer. Was this a time to leave his practising—and

the concerts soon coming on? I positively prefer this

Ziegler man to him. Yes, I do.” So ran her reflections,

and they annoyed her.
“What would you wish me to play?” asked Musa,

when he had definitely finished twanging. Audrey noticed

that his English accent was getting a little less French.

She had to admit that, though his appearance was extravagantly

un-British, it was distinguished. The immensity

of his black silk cravat made the black cravat of Mr. Spatt

seem like a bootlace round his thin neck.
“Whatever you like, Mr. Musa,” replied Aurora Spatt.

“Please!”
And as a fact the excellent woman, majestic now in

spite of her red nose and her excessive thinness, did not

care what Musa played. He had merely to play. She

had decided for herself, from the conversation, that he

was a very celebrated performer, and she had ascertained,

by direct questioning, that he had never performed in

England. She was determined to be able to say to all

comers till death took her that “Musa—the great Musa,

you know—first played in England in my own humble

drawing-room.” The thing itself was actually about to

occur; nothing could stop it from occurring; and the thought

of the immediate realisation of her desire and ambition

gave Mrs. Spatt greater and more real pleasure than she

had had for years; it even fortified her against the possible

resentment of her cherished Mr. Ziegler.
“French music—would you wish?” Musa suggested.
“Is there any French music? That is to say, of artistic

importance?” asked Mr. Ziegler calmly. “I have never

heard of it.”
He was not consciously being rude. Nor was he trying

to be funny. His question implied an honest belief. His

assertion was sincere. He glanced, blinking slightly, round

the room, with a self-confidence that was either terrible

or pathetic, according to the degree of your own self-confidence.
Audrey said to herself.
“I’m glad this isn’t my drawing-room.” And she was

almost frightened by the thought that that skull opposite

to her was absolutely impenetrable, and that it would

go down to the grave unpierced with all its collection of

ideas intact and braggart.
As for Mr. and Mrs. Spatt they were both in the

state of not knowing where to look. Immediately their

gaze met another gaze it leapt away as from something

dangerous or obscene.
“I will play Debussy’s Toccata for violin solo,” Musa

announced tersely. He had blushed; his great eyes were

sparkling. And he began to play.
And as soon as he had played a few bars, Audrey

gave a start, fortunately not a physical start, and she

blushed also. Musa sternly winked at her. Frenchmen

do not make a practice of winking, but he had learnt the

accomplishment for fun from Miss Thompkins in Paris.

The wink caused Audrey surreptitiously to observe Mr.

and Mrs. Spatt. It was no relief to her to perceive that

these two were listening to Debussy’s Toccata for solo

violin with the trained and appreciative attention of people

who had heard it often before in the various capitals of

Europe, who knew it by heart, and who knew at just what

passages to raise the head, to give a nod of recognition

or a gesture of ecstasy. The bare room was filled with

the sound of Musa’s fiddle and with the high musical

culture of Mr. and Mrs. Spatt. When the piece was over

they clapped discreetly, and looked with soft intensity at

Audrey, as if murmuring: “You, too, are a cultured

cosmopolitan. You share our emotion.” And across the

face of Mrs. Spatt spread a glow triumphant, for Musa

now positively had played for the first time in England in

her drawing-room, and she foresaw hundreds of occasions

on which she could refer to the matter with a fitting air of

casualness. The glow triumphant, however, paled somewhat

as she felt upon herself the eye of Mr. Ziegler.
“Where is Siegfried, Alroy?” she demanded, after

having thanked Musa. “I wouldn’t have had him miss

that Debussy for anything, but I hadn’t noticed that he

was gone. He adores Debussy.”
“I think it is like bad Bach,” Mr. Ziegler put in

suddenly. Then he raised his glass and imbibed a good

portion of the beer specially obtained and provided for

him by his hostess and admirer, Mrs. Spatt.
“Do you really?” murmured Mrs. Spatt, with deprecation.
“There’s something in the comparison,” Mr. Spatt

admitted thoughtfully.
“Why not like good Bach?” Musa asked, glaring in

a very strange manner at Mr. Ziegler.
“Bosh!” ejaculated Mr. Ziegler with a most notable

imperturbability. “Only Bach himself could com-pose good

Bach.”
Musa’s breathing could be heard across the drawing-room.
“Eh bien!“ said Musa. “Now I will play for you

Debussy’s Toccata. I was not playing it before. I was

playing the Chaconne of Bach, the most famous composition

for the violin in the world.”
He did not embroider the statement. He left it in its

nakedness. Nor did he permit anybody else to embroider

it. Before a word of any kind could be uttered he had

begun to play again. Probably in all the annals of artistic

snobbery, no cultured cosmopolitan had ever been made

to suffer a more exquisite moral torture of humiliation

than Musa had contrived to inflict upon Mr. and Mrs.

Spatt in return for their hospitality. Their sneaped

squirmings upon the sofa were terrible to witness. But

Mr. Ziegler’s sensibility was apparently quite unaffected.

He continued to smile, to drink, and to smoke. He seemed

to be saying to himself: “What does it matter to me that

this miserable Frenchman has caught me in a mistake?

I could eat him, and one day I shall eat him.”
After a little while Musa snatched out of his right-hand

lower waistcoat pocket the tiny wooden “mute”

which all violinists carry without fail upon all occasions

in all their waistcoats; and, sticking it with marvellous

rapidity upon the bridge of the violin, he entered upon a

pianissimo, but still lively, episode of the Toccata. And

simultaneously another melody faint and clear could be

heard in the room. It was Mr. Ziegler humming “The

Watch on the Rhine” against the Toccata of Debussy.

Thus did it occur to Mr. Ziegler to take revenge on Musa

for having attempted to humiliate him. Not unsurprisingly,

Musa detected at once the competitive air. He continued

to play, gazing hard at his violin and apparently entranced,

but edging little by little towards Mr. Ziegler. Audrey

desired either to give a cry or to run out of the room.

She did neither, being held to inaction by the spell of Mr.

Ziegler’s perfect unconcern as, with the beer glass lifted

towards his mouth, he proceeded steadily to work through

“The Watch on the Rhine,” while Musa lilted out the

delicate, gay phrases of Debussy. The enchantment upon

the whole room was sinister and painful. Musa got closer

to Mr. Ziegler, who did not blench nor cease from his

humming. Then suddenly Musa, lowering his fiddle and

interrupting the scene, snatched the mute from the bridge

of the violin.
“I have put it on the wrong instrument,” he said thickly,

with a very French intonation, and simultaneously he

shoved the mute with violence into the mouth of Mr.

Ziegler. In doing so, he jerked up Mr. Ziegler’s elbow,

and the remains of the beer flew up and baptised Mr.

Ziegler’s face and vesture. Then he jammed the violin

into its case, and ran out of the room.
“Barbare! Imbécile! Sauvage!“ he muttered ferociously

on the threshold.
The enchantment was broken. Everybody rose, and not

the least precipitately the streaming Mr. Ziegler, who, ejecting

the mute with much spluttering, and pitching away his

empty glass, sprang towards the door, with justifiable

homicide in every movement.
“Mr. Ziegler!” Audrey appealed to him, snatching at

his dress-coat and sticking to it.
He turned, furious, his face still dripping the finest

Pilsener beer.
“If your dress-coat is not wiped instantly, it will be

ruined,” said Audrey.
“Ach! Meiner Frack!“ exclaimed Mr. Ziegler, forgetting

his deep knowledge of English. His economic

instincts had been swiftly aroused, and they dominated all

the other instincts. “Meiner Frack! Vill you vipe it?”

His glance was imploring.
“Oh! Mrs. Spatt will attend to it,” said Audrey with

solemnity, and walked out of the room into the hall. There

was not a sign of Musa; the disappearance of the violinist

was disquieting; and yet it made her glad—so much so

that she laughed aloud. A few moments later Mr. Ziegler

stalked forth from the house which he was never to enter

again, and his silent scorn and the grandeur of his displeasure

were terrific. He entirely ignored Audrey, who had

nevertheless been the means of saving his Frack for him.

CHAPTER XXVI
NOCTURNE
Soon afterwards Audrey, who had put on a hat, went out

with Mr. Spatt to look for Musa. Not until shortly before

the musical performance had the Spatts succeeded in persuading

Musa to “accept their hospitality for the night.”

(The phrase was their own. They were incapable of saying

“Let us put you up.") Meanwhile his bag had been left in

the hall. This bag had now vanished. The parlourmaid,

questioned, said frigidly that she had not touched it because

she had received no orders to touch it. Musa himself must

therefore have removed it. With bag in one hand and

fiddle case in the other, he must have fled, relinquishing

nothing but the mute in his flight. He knew naught of

England, naught of Frinton, and he was the least practical

creature alive. Hence Audrey, who was in essence his

mother, and who knew Frinton as some people know London,

had said that she would go and look for him. Mr.

Spatt, ever chivalrous, had impulsively offered to accompany

her. He could indeed do no less. Mrs. Spatt, overwhelmed

by the tragic sequel to her innocent triumphant, had retired

to the first floor.
The wind blew, and it was very dark, as Audrey and

her squire passed along Third Avenue to the front. They

did not converse—they were both too shy, too impressed by

the peculiarity of the predicament. They simply peered.

They peered everywhere for the truant form of Musa

balanced on one side by a bag and on the other by a fiddle

case. From the trim houses, each without exception new,

twinkled discreet lights, with glimpses of surpassingly

correct domesticity, and the wind rustled loudly through the

foliage of the prim gardens, ruffling them as it might have

ruffled the unwilling hair of the daughters of an arch-deacon.

Nobody was abroad. Absurd thoughts ran

through Audrey’s head. A letter from Mr. Foulger had

followed her to Birmingham, and in the letter Mr. Foulger

had acquainted her with the fact that Great Mexican Oil

shares had just risen to £2 3s. apiece. She knew that she

had 180,000 of them, and now under the thin protection of

Mr. Spatt she tried to reckon 180,000 times £2 3s. She

could not do the sum. At any rate she could not be sure

that she did it correctly. However, she was fairly well convinced

beneath the dark, impenetrable sky that the answer

totalled nearly £400,000, that was, ten million francs.

And the ridiculousness of an heiress who owned over ten

million francs wandering about a place like Frinton with a

man like Mr. Spatt, searching for another man like Musa,

struck her as exceeding the bounds of the permissible. She

considered that she ought to have been in a magnificent

drawing-room of her own in Park Lane or the Avenue du

Bois de Boulogne, welcoming counts, princes, duchesses,

diplomats and self-possessed geniuses of finished manners,

with witty phrase that displayed familiarity with all that

was profoundest and most brilliant in European civilisation.

Life seemed to be disappointing her, and assuredly money

was not the thing that she had imagined it to be.
She thought:
“If this walking lamp-post does not say something soon

I shall scream.”
Mr. Spatt said:
“It seems to be blowing up for rain.”
She screamed in the silent solitude of Frinton.
“I’m so sorry,” she apologised quickly. “I thought I

saw something move.”
“One does,” faltered Mr. Spatt.
They were now in the shopping street, where in the

mornings the elect encounter each other on expeditions to

purchase bridge-markers, chocolate, bathing costumes and

tennis balls. It was a black and empty canyon through

which the wind raced.
“He may be down—down on the shore,” Mr. Spatt

timidly suggested. He seemed to be suggesting suicide.
They turned and descended across the Greensward to

the shore, which was lined with hundreds of bathing huts,

each christened with a name, and each deserted, for the

by-laws of the Frinton Urban District Council judiciously

forbade that the huts should be used as sleeping-chambers.

The tide was very low. They walked over the wide flat

sands, and came at length to the sea’s roar, the white

tumbling of foamy breakers, and the full force of the south-east

wind. Across the invisible expanse of water could be

discerned the beam of a lightship. And Audrey was aware

of mysterious sensations such as she had not had since she

inhabited Flank Hall and used to steal out at nights to

watch the estuary. And she thought solemnly: “Musa is

somewhere near, existing.” And then she thought: “What

a silly thought! Of course he is!”
“I see somebody coming!” Mr. Spatt burst out in a

dramatic whisper. But the precaution of whispering was

useless, because the next instant, in spite of himself, he

loudly sneezed.
And about two hundred yards off on the sands Audrey

made out a moving figure, which at that distance did in

fact seem to have vague appendages that might have resembled

a bag and a fiddle case. But the atmosphere of

the night was deceptive, and the figure as it approached

resolved itself into three figures—a black one in the middle

of two white ones. A girl’s coarse laugh came down the

wind. It could not conceivably have been the laugh of any

girl who went into the shopping street to buy bridge-markers,

chocolate, bathing costumes or tennis balls. But

it might have been—it not improbably was—the laugh of

some girl whose mission was to sell such things. The trio

meandered past, heedless. Mr. Spatt said no word, but he

appreciably winced. The black figure in the midst of the

two white ones was that of his son Siegfried, reputedly so

fond of Debussy. As the group receded and faded, a fragment

of a music-hall song floated away from it into the

firmament.
“I’m afraid it’s not much use looking any longer,” said

Mr. Spatt weakly. “He—he may have gone back to the

house. Let us hope so.”
At the chief garden gate of the Spatt residence they

came upon Miss Nickall, trying to open it. The sling

round her arm made her unmistakable. And Miss Nickall

having allowed them to recover from a pardonable astonishment

at the sight of her who was supposed to be exhausted

and in bed, said cheerfully:
“I’ve found him, and I’ve put him up at the Excelsior

Hotel.”
Mrs. Spatt had related the terrible episode to her guest,

who had wilfully risen at once. Miss Nickall had had luck,

but Audrey had to admit that these American girls were

stupendously equal to an emergency. And she hated the

angelic Nick for having found Musa.
“We tried first to find a café,” said Nick. “But there

aren’t any in this city. What do you call them in England—public-houses,

isn’t it?”
“No,” agreed Mr. Spatt in a shaking voice. “Public-houses

are not permitted in Frinton, I am glad to say.” And

he began to form an intention, subject to Aurora’s approval,

to withdraw altogether from the suffrage movement, which

appeared to him to be getting out of hand.
As they were all separating for the night Audrey and

Nick hesitated for a moment in front of each other, and

then they kissed with a quite unusual effusiveness.
“I don’t think I’ve ever really liked her,” said Audrey

to herself.
What Nick said to herself is lost to history.

CHAPTER XXVII
IN THE GARDEN
The next morning, after a night spent chiefly in thought,

Audrey issued forth rather early. Indeed she was probably

the first person afoot in the house of the Spatts, the parlour-maid

entering the hall just as Audrey had managed to open

the front door. As the parlour-maid was obviously not yet

in that fullness and spruceness of attire which parlour-maids

affect when performing their mission in life, Audrey decided

to offer no remark, explanatory or otherwise, and passed

into the garden with nonchalance as though her invariable

habit when staying in strange houses was to get up before

anybody else and spy out the whole property while the

helpless hosts were yet in bed and asleep.
Now it was a magnificent morning: no wind, no cloud,

and the sun rising over the sea; not a trace of the previous

evening’s weather. Audrey had not been in the leafy street

more than a moment when she forgot that she was tired

and short of sleep, and also very worried by affairs both

private and public. Her body responded to the sun, and

her mind also. She felt almost magically healthy, strong

and mettlesome, and, further, she began to feel happy; she

rather blamed herself for this tendency to feel happy, calling

herself heedless and indifferent. She did not understand

what it is to be young. She had risen partly because of the

futility of bed, but more because of a desire to inspect again

her own part of the world after the unprecedented absence

from it.
Frinton was within the borders of her own part of the

world, and, though she now regarded it with the condescending

eyes of a Parisian and Londoner, she found pleasure in

looking upon it and in recognising old landmarks and recent

innovations. She saw, on the Greensward separating the

promenade from the beach, that a rustic seat had been

elaborately built by the Council round the great trunk of the

only tree in Frinton; and she decided that there had been

questionable changes since her time. And in this way she

went on. However, the splendour and reality of the sun,

making such an overwhelming contrast with the insubstantial

phenomena of the gloomy night, prevented undue

cerebral activity. She reflected that Frinton on a dark night

and Frinton on a bright morning were not like the same

place, and she left it at that, and gazed at the façade of the

Excelsior Hotel, wondering for an instant why she should be

interested in it, and then looking swiftly away.
She had to glance at all the shops, though none of

them was open except the dairy-shop; and in the shopping

street, which had a sunrise at one end and the

railway station at the other, she lit on the new palatial

garage.
“My car may be in there,” she thought.
After the manner of most car-owners on tour, she had

allowed the chauffeur to disappear with the car in the

evening where he listed, confident that the next morning

he and it would reappear cleansed and in good running

order.
The car was in the garage, almost solitary on a floor

of asphalt under a glass roof. An untidy youth, with the

end of a cigarette clinging to his upper lip in a way to

suggest that it had clung there throughout the night and

was the last vestige of a jollification, seemed to be dragging

a length of hose from a hydrant towards the car, the while

his eyes rested on a large notice: “Smoking absolutely

prohibited. By order.”
Then from the other extremity of the garage came a

jaunty, dapper, quasi-martial figure, in a new grey uniform,

with a peaked grey cap, bright brown leggings, and bright

brown boots to match—the whole highly brushed, polished,

smooth and glittering. This being pulled out of his pocket

a superb pair of kid gloves, then a silver cigarette-case, and

then a silver match-box, and he ignited a cigarette—the

unrivalled, wondrous first cigarette of the day—casting down

the match with a large, free gesture. At sight of him the

untidy youth grew more active.
“Look ’ere,” said the being to the youth, “what the ’ell

time did I tell you to have that car cleaned by, and you

not begun it!”
Pointing to the clock, he lounged magnificently to and

fro, spreading smoke around the intimidated and now industrious

youth. The next second he caught sight of

Audrey, and transformed himself instantaneously into what

she had hitherto imagined a chauffeur always was; but in

those few moments she had learnt that the essence of a

chauffeur is godlike, and that he toils not, neither does

he swab.
“Good morning, madam,” in a soft, courtly voice.
“Good morning.”
“Were you wanting the car, madam?”
She was not, but the suggestion gave her an idea.
“Can we take it as it is?”
“Yes, madam. I’ll just look at the petrol gauge ...

But ... I haven’t had my breakfast, madam.”
“What time do you have it?”
“Well, madam, when you have yours.”
“That’s all right, then. You’ve got hours yet. I want

you to take me to Flank Hall.”
“Flank Hall, madam?” His tone expressed the fact

that his mind was a blank as to Flank Hall.
As soon as Audrey had comprehended that the situation

of Flank Hall was not necessarily known to every chauffeur

in England, and that a stay of one night in Frinton might

not have been enough to familiarise this particular one with

the geography of the entire district, she replied that she

would direct him.
They were held up by a train at the railway crossing,

and a milk-cart and a young pedestrian were also held up.

When Audrey identified the pedestrian she wished momentarily

that she had not set out on the expedition. Then

she said to herself that really it did not matter, and why

should she be afraid ... etc., etc. The pedestrian was

Musa. In French they greeted each other stiffly, like

distant acquaintances, and the train thundered past.
“I was taking the air, simply, Madame,” said Musa,

with his ingenuous shy smile.
“Take it in my car,” said Audrey with a sudden resolve.

“In one hour at the latest we shall have returned.”
She had a great deal to say to him and a great deal

to listen to, and there could not possibly be any occasion

equal to the present, which was ideal.
He got in; the chauffeur manoeuvred to oust the milk-cart

from its rightful precedence, the gates opened, and the

car swung at gathering speed into the well-remembered road

to Moze. And the two passengers said nothing to each

other of the slightest import. Musa’s escape from Paris

was between them; the unimaginable episode at the Spatts

was between them; the sleepless night was between them.

(And had she not saved him by her presence of mind from

the murderous hand of Mr. Ziegler?) They had a million

things to impart. And yet naught was uttered save a few

banalities about the weather and about the healthfulness of

being up early. They were bashful, constrained, altogether

too young and inexperienced. They wanted to behave in

the grand, social, easeful manner of a celebrated public performer

and an heiress worth ten million francs. And they

could only succeed in being a boy and a girl. The chauffeur

alone, at from thirty to forty miles an hour, was worthy of

himself and his high vocation. Both the passengers regretted

that they had left their beds. Happily the car

laughed at the alleged distance between Frinton and Moze.

In a few minutes, as it seemed, with but one false turning,

due to the impetuosity of the chauffeur, the vehicle drew

up before the gates of Flank Hall. Audrey had avoided

the village of Moze. The passengers descended.
“This is my house,” Audrey murmured.
The gates were shut but not locked. They creaked as

Audrey pushed against them. The drive was covered with

a soft film of green, as though it were gradually being

entombed in the past. The young roses, however, belonged

emphatically to the present. Dewdrops hung from them

like jewels, and their odour filled the air. Audrey turned

off the main drive towards the garden front of the house,

which had always been the aspect that she preferred, and

at the same moment she saw the house windows and the

thrilling perspective of Mozewater. One of the windows

was open. She was glad, because this proved that the

perfect Aguilar, gardener and caretaker, was after all

imperfect. It was his crusty perfection that had ever set

Audrey, and others, against Aguilar. But he had gone to

bed and forgotten a window—and it was the French

window. While, in her suddenly revived character of a

harsh Essex inhabitant, she was thinking of some sarcastic

word to say to Aguilar about the window, another window

slowly opened from within, and Aguilar’s head became

visible. Once more he had exasperatingly proved his perfection.

He had not gone to bed and forgotten a window.

But he had risen with exemplary earliness to give air to

the house.
“’d mornin’, miss,” mumbled the unsmiling Aguilar,

impassively, as though Audrey had never been away from

Moze.
“Well, Aguilar.”
“I didn’t expect ye so early, miss.”
“But how could you be expecting me at all?”
“Miss Ingate come home yesterday. She said you

couldn’t be far off, miss.”
“Not Miss ... Mrs.—Moncreiff,” said Audrey firmly.
“I beg your pardon, madam,” Aguilar responded with absolute

imperturbability. “She never said nothing about that.”
And he proceeded mechanically to the next window.
The yard-dog began to bark. Audrey, ignoring Musa,

went round the shrubbery towards the kennel. The

chained dog continued to bark, furiously, until Audrey was

within six feet of him, and then he crouched and squirmed

and gave low whines and his tail wagged with extreme

rapidity. Audrey bent down, trembling.... She could

scarcely see.... There was something about the green

film on the drive, about the look of the house, about the

sheeted drawing-room glimpsed through the open window,

about the view of Mozewater...! She felt acutely and

painfully sorry for, and yet envious of, the young girl in a

plain blue frock who used to haunt the house and the

garden, and who had somehow made the house and the

garden holy for evermore by her unhappiness and her longings....

Audrey was crying.... She heard a step and

stood upright. It was Musa’s step.
“I have never seen you so exquisite,” said Musa in a

murmur subdued and yet enthusiastic. All his faculties

seemed to be dwelling reflectively upon her with passionate

appreciation.
They had at last begun to talk, really—he in French, and

she partly in French and partly in English. It was her

tears, or perhaps her gesture in trying to master them, that

had loosed their tongues. The ancient dog was forgotten,

and could not understand why. Audrey was excusably

startled by Musa’s words and tone, and by the sudden change

in his attitude. She thought that his personal distinction

at the moment was different from and superior to any other

in her experience. She had a comfortable feeling of condescension

towards Nick and towards Jane Foley. And

at the same time she blamed Musa, perceiving that as usual

he was behaving like a child who cannot grasp the great

fact that life is very serious.
“Yes,” she said. “That’s all very fine, that is. You

pretend this, that, and the other. But why are you here?

Why aren’t you at work in Paris? You’ve got the chance

of a lifetime, and instead of staying at home and

practising hard and preparing yourself, you come gadding

over to England simply because there’s a bit of money in

your pocket!”
She was very young, and in the splendour of the

magnificent morning she looked the emblem of simplicity;

but in her heart she was his mother, his sole fount of

wisdom and energy and shrewdness.
Pain showed in his sensitive features, and then appeal,

and then a hot determination.
“I came because I could not work,” he said.
“Because you couldn’t work? Why couldn’t you

work?” There was no yielding in her hard voice.
“I don’t know! I don’t know! I suppose it is because

you are not there, because you have made yourself

necessary to me; or,” he corrected quickly, “because I

have made you necessary to myself. Oh! I can practise

for so many hours per day. But it is useless. It is not

authentic practice. I think not of the music. It is as if

some other person was playing, with my arm, on my violin.

I am not there. I am with you, where you are. It is the

same day after day, every day, every day. I am done for.

I am convinced that I am done for. These concerts will

infallibly be my ruin, and I shall be shamed before all Paris.”
“And did you come to England to tell me this?”
“Yes.”
She was relieved, for she had thought of another explanation

of his escapade, and had that explanation proved

to be the true one, she was very ready to make unpleasantness

to the best of her ability. Nevertheless, though

relieved in one direction, she was gravely worried in another.

She had undertaken the job of setting Musa grandiosely

on his artistic career, and the difficulties of it were growing

more and more complex and redoubtable.
She said:
“But you seemed so jolly when you arrived last night.

Nobody would have guessed you had a care in the world.”
“I had not,” he replied eagerly, “as soon as I saw you.

The surprise of seeing you—it was that.... And you left

Paris without saying good-bye! Why did you leave Paris

without saying good-bye? Never since the moment when

I learnt that you had gone have I had the soul to practise.

My violin became a wooden box; my fingers, too, were of

wood.”
He stopped. The dog sniffed round.
Audrey was melting in bliss. She could feel herself

dissolving. Her pleasure was terrible. It was true that

she had left Paris without saying good-bye to Musa. She

had done it on purpose. Why? She did not know.

Perhaps out of naughtiness, perhaps.... She was aware

that she could be hard, like her father. But she was glad,

intensely glad, that she had left Paris so, because the result

had been this avowal. She, Audrey, little Audrey, scarcely

yet convinced that she was grown up, was necessary to the

genius whom all the Quarter worshipped! Miss Thompkins

was not necessary to him, Miss Nickall was not necessary

to him, though both had helped to provide the means to

keep him alive. She herself alone was necessary to him.

And she had not guessed it. She had not even hoped for

it. The effect of her personality upon Musa was mysterious—she

did not affect to understand it—but it was obviously

real and it was vital. If anything in the world could surpass

the pleasure, her pride surpassed it. All tears were forgotten.

She was the proudest young woman in the world;

and she was the wisest, and the most harassed, too. But the

anxieties were delicious to her.
“I am essential to him,” she thought ecstatically. “I

stand between him and disaster. When he has succeeded

his success will be my work and nobody else’s. I have a

mission. I must live for it.... If anyone had told me

a year ago that a great French genius would be absolutely

dependent upon me, and that I meant for him all the

difference between failure and triumph, I should have

laughed.... And yet!...” She looked at him surreptitiously.

“He’s an angel. But he’s also a baby.” The

feelings of motherhood were as naught compared to hers.
Then she remarked harshly, icily:
“Well, I shall be much obliged if you will go back to

Paris at once—to-day. Somebody must have a little sense.”
Just at this point Aguilar interrupted. He came slouching

round the corner of the clipped bushes, untidy, shabby,

implacable, with some set purpose in his hard blue eyes.

She could have annihilated him with satisfaction, but the

fellow was indestructible as well as implacable.
“Could I have a word with ye, madam?” he mumbled,

putting on his well-known air of chicane.
With the unexplained Musa close by her she could not

answer: “Wait a little. I’m engaged.” She had to be

careful. She had to make out especially that she and the

young man were up to nothing in particular, nothing that

had the slightest importance.
“What is it, Aguilar?” she questioned, inimically.
“It’s down here,” said Aguilar, who recked not of the

implications of a tone. And by the mere force of his glance

he drew his mistress away, out of sight of Musa and the

dog.
“Is that your motor-car at the gates, madam?” he

demanded gloomily and confidentially, his gaze now fixed

on the ground or on his patched boots.
“Of course it is,” said Audrey. “Why, what’s the

matter?”
“That’s all right then,” said he. “But I thought it

might belong to another person, and I had to make sure.

Now if ye’ll just step along a bit farther, I’ve a little thing

as I want to point out to ye, madam. It’s my duty to point

it out, let others say what they will.”
He walked ahead doggedly, and Audrey crossly came

after, until they arrived nearly at the end of the hedge

which, separating the upper from the lower garden, hid

from those immediately behind it all view of the estuary.

Here, still sheltered by the hedge, he stopped and Audrey

stopped, and Aguilar absently plucked up a young plantain

from the turf and dropped it into his pocket.
“There’s been a man a-hanging round this place since

yesterday mornin’,” said Aguilar intimately. “I call him a

suspicious character—at least, I did, till last night. He

ain’t slept in the village, that I do know, but he’s about

again this morning.”
“Well,” said Audrey with impatience. “Why don’t you

tell Inspector Keeble? Or have you quarrelled with

Inspector Keeble again?”
“It’s not that as would ha’ stopped me from acquainting

Inspector Keeble with the circumstances if I thought

it my duty so to do,” replied Aguilar. “But the fact is I

saw the chap talking to Inspector Keeble yesterday evening.

He don’t know as I saw him. It was that as made me

think; now is he a suspicious character or ain’t he? Of

course Keeble’s a rare simple-minded ’un, as we all know.”
“And what do you want me to do?”
“I thought you might like to have a look at him yeself,

madam. And if you’ll just peep round the end of this hedge

casual-like, ye’ll see him walking across the salting from

Lousey Hard. He’s a-comin’ this way. Casual-like now—and

he won’t see ye.”
Audrey had to obey. She peeped casual-like, and she

did in fact see a man on the salting, and this man was

getting nearer. She could see him very plainly in the

brilliant clearness of the summer morning. After the

shortest instant of hesitation she recognised him beyond

any doubt. It was the detective who had been so

plenteously baptised by Susan Foley in the area of the house

at Paget Gardens. Aguilar looked at Audrey, and Audrey

annoyed herself somewhat by blushing. However, an agreeable

elation quickly overcame the blush.

CHAPTER XXVIII
ENCOUNTER
“Good morning,” Audrey cried, very gaily, to the still

advancing detective, who, after the slightest hesitation in

the world, responded gaily:
“Good morning.”
The man’s accent struck her. She said to herself, with

amusement:
“He’s Irish!”
Audrey had left the astonished but dispassionate gardener

at the hedge, and was now emerging from the scanty and

dishevelled plantation close to the boundary wall of the

estate. She supposed that the police must have been on her

track and on the track of Jane Foley, and that by some

mysterious skill they had hunted her down. But she did

not care. She was not in the least afraid. The sudden

vision of a jail did not affright her. On the contrary her

chief sensation was one of joyous self-confidence, which

sensation had been produced in her by the remarks and the

attitude of Musa. She had always known that she was both

shy and adventurous, and that the two qualities were

mutually contradictory; but now it appeared to her that

diffidence had been destroyed, and that that change which

she had ever longed for in her constitution had at least

really come to pass.
“You don’t seem very surprised to see me,” said Audrey.
“Well, madam,” said the detective, “I’m not paid to

be surprised—in my business.”
He had raised his hat. He was standing on the dyke,

and from that height he looked somewhat down upon

Audrey leaning against the wall. The watercourse and the

strip of eternally emerald-green grass separated them.

Though neither tall nor particularly handsome, he was a

personable man, with a ready smile and alert, agile movements.

Audrey was too far off to judge of his eyes, but

she was quite sure that they twinkled. The contrast

between this smart, cheerful fellow and the half-drowned

victim in the area of the house in Paget Gardens was quite

acute.
“Now I’ve a good mind to hold a meeting for your

benefit,” said Audrey, striving to recall the proper phrases

of propaganda which she had heard in the proper quarters

in London during her brief connection with the cause.

However, she could not recall them, “But there’s no need

to,” she added. “A gentleman of your intelligence must be

of our way of thinking.”
“About what?”
“About the vote, of course. And so your conduct is all

the more shocking.”
“Why!” he exclaimed, laughing. “If it comes to that,

your own sex is against you.”
Audrey had heard this argument before, and it had the

same effect on her as on most other stalwarts of the new

political creed. It annoyed her, because there was something

in it.
“The vast majority of women are with us,” said she.
“My wife isn’t.”
“But your wife isn’t the vast majority of women,”

Audrey protested.
“Oh yes, she is,” said the detective, “so far as I’m

concerned. Every wife is, so far as her husband is concerned.

Sure, you ought to know that!” In his Irish

way he doubled the “r” of the word “sure,” and somehow

this trick made Audrey like him still more. “My wife

believes,” he concluded, “that woman’s sphere is the

home.”
("His wife is stout,” Audrey decided within herself, on

no grounds whatever. “If she wasn’t, she couldn’t be a

vast majority.")
Aloud she said:
“Well, then, why can’t you leave them alone in their

sphere, instead of worrying them and spying on them down

areas?”
“D’ye mean at Paget Gardens?”
“Of course.”
“Oh!” he laughed. “That wasn’t professional—if

you’ll excuse me being so frank. That was just due to

human admiration. It’s not illegal to admire a young

woman, I suppose, even if she is a suffragette.”
“What young woman are you talking about?”
“Miss Susan Foley, of course. I won’t tell you what

I think of her, in spite of all she did, because I’ve learnt

that it’s a mistake to praise one woman to another. But

I don’t mind admitting that her going off to the north has

made me life a blank. If I’d thought she’d go, I should

never have reported the affair at the Yard. But I was

annoyed, and I’m rather hasty.” He paused, and ended

reflectively: “I committed follies to get a word with the

young lady, and I didn’t get it, but I’d do the same again.”
“And you a married man!” Audrey burst out, startled,

and diverted, at the explanation, but at the same time outraged

by a confession so cynical.
The detective pulled a silky moustache.
“When a wife is very strongly convinced that her

sphere is the home,” he retorted slowly and seriously,

“you’re tempted at times to let her have the sphere all

to herself. That’s the universal experience of married men,

and ye may believe me, miss—madam.”
Audrey said:
“And now Miss Foley’s gone north, you’ve decided to

come and admire me in my home!”
“So it is your home!” murmured the detective with

an uncontrolled quickness which wakened Audrey’s old

suspicions afresh—and which created a new suspicion, the

suspicion that the fellow was simply playing with her.

“I assure you I came here to recover; I’d heard it was

the finest climate in England.”
“Recover?”
“Yes, from fire-extinguishers. D’ye know I coughed

for twenty-four hours after that reception?... And you

should have seen my clothes! The doctor says my lungs

may never get over it.... That’s what comes of

admiration.”
“It’s what comes of behaving as no married man ought

to behave.”
“Did I say I was married?” asked the detective with

an ingenuous air. “Well, I may be. But I dare say I’m

only married just about as much as you are yourself,

madam.”
Upon this remark he raised his hat and departed along

the grassy summit of the sea-wall.
Audrey flushed for the second time that morning, and

more strikingly than before. She was extremely discontented

with, and ashamed of, herself, for she had meant

to be the equal of the detective, and she had not been.

It was blazingly clear that he had indeed played with her—or,

as she put it in her own mind: “He just stuffed

me up all through.”
She tried to think logically. Had he been pursuing

the motor-car all the way from Birmingham? Obviously

he had not, since according to Aguilar he had been in the

vicinity of Moze since the previous morning. Hence he

did not know that Audrey was involved in the Blue City

affair, and he did not know that Jane Foley was at

Frinton. How he had learnt that Audrey belonged to

Moze, and why and what he had come to investigate at

Moze, she could not guess. Nor did these problems appear

to her to have an importance at all equal to the importance

of hiding from the detective that she had been staying

at Frinton. If he followed her to Frinton he would inevitably

discover that Jane Foley was at Frinton, and the

sequel would be more imprisonment for Jane. Therefore

Audrey must not return to Frinton. Having by a masterly

process of ratiocination reached this conclusion, she began

to think rather better of herself, and ceased blushing.
“Aguilar,” she demanded excitedly, having gone back

through the plantation. “Did Miss Ingate happen to say

where I was staying last night?”
“No, madam.”
“I must run into the house and write a note to her,

and you must take it down instantly.” In her mind she

framed the note, which was to condemn Miss Ingate to

the torture of complete and everlasting silence about the

episode at the Blue City and the flight eastwards.

CHAPTER XXIX
FLIGHT
”Fast, madam, did you say?” asked the chauffeur, bending

his head back from the wheel as the car left the gates

of Flank Hall.
“Fast.”
“The Colchester road?”
“Yes.”
“It’s really just as quick to take the Frinton road for

Colchester—it’s so much straighter.”
“No, no, no! On no account. Don’t go near Frinton.”
Audrey leaned back in the car. And as speed increased

the magnificence of the morning again had its effect on

her. The adventure pleased her far more than the perils

of it, either for herself or for other people, frightened

her. She knew that she was doing a very strange thing

in thus leaving the Spatts and her luggage without a

word of explanation before breakfast; but she did not

care. She knew that for some reason which she did not

comprehend the police were after her, as they had been

after nearly all the great ones of the movement; but she

did not care. She was alive in the rushing car amid the

magnificence of the morning. Musa sat next to her. She

had more or less incompletely explained the situation to

him—it was not necessary to tell everything to a boy who

depended upon you absolutely for his highest welfare—such

boys must accept, thankfully, what they received.

And Musa had indeed done so. He appeared to be quite

happy and without anxieties. That was the worst

He had wanted to be with her, and he was with her, and

he cared for nothing else. He had no interest in what

might happen next. He yielded himself utterly to the enjoyment

of her presence and of the magnificent morning.
And yet Musa, whom Audrey considered that she understood

as profoundly as any mother had ever understood

any child—even Musa could surprise.
He said, without any preparation:
“I calculate that I shall have 3,040 francs in hand after

the concerts, assuming that I receive only the minimum.

That is, after paying the expenses of my living.”
“But do you know how much it costs you to live?”

Audrey demanded, with careless superiority.
“Assuredly. I write all my payments down in a little

book. I have done so since some years.”
“Every sou?”
“Yes. Every sou.”
“But do you save, Musa?”
“Save!” he repeated the word ingenuously. “Till

now to save has been impossible for me. But I have

always kept in hand one month’s subsistence. I could not

do more. Now I shall save. You reproached me with

having spent money in order to come to see you in

England. But I regarded the money so spent as part of

the finance of the concerts. Without seeing you I could

not practise. Without practice I could not play. Without

playing I could not earn money. Therefore I spent money

in order to get money. Such, Madame, was the commercial

side. What a beautiful lawn for tennis you have

in your garden!”
Audrey was more than surprised, she was staggered

by the revelation of the attitude of genius towards money.

She had not suspected it. Then she remembered the simple

natural tome in which Musa had once told her that both

Tommy and Nick contributed to his income. She ought

to have comprehended from that avowal more than she,

in fact, had comprehended. And now the first hopes of

worldly success were strongly developing that unsuspected

trait in the young man’s character. Audrey was aware

of a great fear. Could he be a genius, after all? Was

it conceivable that an authentic musical genius should enter

up daily in a little book every sou he spent?
A rapid, spitting, explosive sound, close behind the

car and a little to the right, took her mind away from

Musa and back to the adventure. She looked round, half

expecting what she should see—and she saw it, namely,

the detective on a motor-cycle. It was an “Indian” machine

and painted red. And as she looked, the car, after taking

a corner, got into a straight bit of the splendid road and

the motor-bicycle dropped away from it.
“Can’t you shake off that motor-bicycle thing?” Audrey

rather superciliously asked the chauffeur.
Having first looked at his mirror, the chauffeur, who,

like a horse, could see in two directions at once, gazed

cautiously at the road in front and at the motor-bicycle

behind, simultaneously.
“I doubt it, madam,” he said. And yet his tone and

glance expressed deep scorn of the motor-bicycle. “As

a general rule you can’t.”
“I should have thought you could beat a little thing

like that,” said Audrey.
“Them things can do sixty when they’ve a mind to,”

said the chauffeur, with finality, and gave all his attention

to the road.
At intervals he looked at his mirror. The motor-bicycle

had vanished into the past, and as it failed to reappear he

gradually grew confident and disdainful. But just as the

car was going down the short hill into the outskirts of

Colchester the motor-bicycle came into view once more.
“Where to, madam?” inquired the chauffeur.
“This is Colchester, isn’t it?” she demanded nervously,

though she knew perfectly well that it was Colchester.
“Yes, madam.”
“Straight through! Straight through!”
“The London road?”
“Yes. The London road,” she agreed. London was,

of course, the only possible destination.
“But breakfast, madam?”
“Oh! The usual thing,” said Audrey. “You’ll have

yours when I have mine.”
“But we shall run out of petrol, madam.”
“Never mind,” said Audrey sublimely.
The chauffeur, with characteristic skill, arranged that

the car should run out of petrol precisely in front of the

best hotel in Chelmsford, which was about half-way to

London. The motor-bicycle had not been seen for several

miles. But scarcely had they resumed the journey, by

the Epping road, when it came again into view—in front

of them. How had the fellow guessed that they would

take the longer Epping road instead of the shorter

Romford road?
“When shall we be arriving in Frinton?” Musa inquired,

beatific.
“We shan’t be arriving in Frinton any more,” said

Audrey. “We must go straight to London.”
“It is like a dream,” Musa murmured, as it were

in ecstasy. Then his features changed and he almost

screamed: “But my violin! My violin! We must go

back for it.”
“Violin!” said Audrey. “That’s nothing! I’ve even

come without gloves.” And she had.
She reassured Musa as to the violin, and the chauffeur

as to the abandoned Gladstone bag containing the chauffeur’s

personal effects, and herself as to many things. An

hour and twenty minutes later the car, with three people

in it, thickly dusted even to the eyebrows, drew up in

the courtyard of Charing Cross railway station, and the

motor-cycle was visible, its glaring red somewhat paled,

in the Strand outside. The time was ten-fifteen.
“We shall take the eleven o’clock boat train for Paris,”

she said to Musa.
“You also?”
She nodded. He was in heaven. He could even do

without his violin.
“How nice it is not to be bothered with luggage,”

she said.
The chauffeur was pacified with money, of which Audrey

had a sufficiency.
And all the time Audrey kept saying to herself:
“I’m not going to Paris to please Musa, so don’t let

him think it! I’m only going so as to put the detective

off and keep Jane Foley out of his clutches, because if I

stay in London he’ll be bound to find everything out.”
While Musa kept watch for the detective at the door

of the telegraph office Audrey telegraphed, as laconically

as possible, to Frinton concerning clothes and the violin,

and then they descended to subterranean marble chambers

in order to get rid of dust, and they came up to earth

again, each out of a separate cellar, renewed. And, lastly,

Audrey slipped into the Strand and bought a pair of gloves,

and thereafter felt herself to be completely equipped against

the world’s gaze.

CHAPTER XXX
ARIADNE
A few days later an automobile—not Audrey’s but a large

limousine—bumped, with slow and soft dignity, across the

railway lines which diversify the quays of Boulogne harbour

and, having hooted in a peculiar manner, came to a stop

opposite nothing in particular.
“Here we are,” said Mr. Gilman, reaching to open

the door. “You can see her masthead light.”
It was getting dark. Behind, over the station, a very

faint flush lightened the west, and in front, across the

water, and reflected in the water, the thousand lamps of

the town rose in tiers to the lofty church which stood out

a dark mass against the summer sky. On the quays the

forms of men moved vaguely among crates and packages,

and on the water, tugs and boats flitted about, puffing,

or with the plash of oars, or with no sound whatever.

And from the distance arrived the reverberation of electric

trams running their courses in the maze of the town.
Madame Piriac and Audrey descended, after Mr. Gilman,

from the car and Mr. Gilman turned off the electric light

in the interior and shut the door.
“Do not trouble about the luggage, I beg you,” said

Mr. Gilman, breathing, as usual, rather noticeably. “Bon

soir, Leroux. Don’t forget to meet the nine-thirty-five.”

This last to the white-clad chauffeur, who saluted sharply.
At the same moment two sailors appeared over the edge

of the quay, and a Maltese cross of light burst into radiance

at the end of a sloping gangway, whose summit was

just perched on the solid masonry of the port. The sailors

were clothed in blue, with white caps, and on their breasts

they bore the white-embroidered sign: “Ariadne, R.T.Y.C.“
“Look lively, lads, with the luggage,” said Mr. Gilman.
“Yes, sir.”
Then another figure appeared under the Maltese cross.

It was clad in white ducks, with a blue reefer ornamented

in gold, and a yachting cap crowned in white: a stoutish

and middle-aged figure, much like Mr. Gilman himself in

bearing and costume, except that Mr. Gilman had no gold

on his jacket.
“Well, skipper!” greeted Mr. Gilman, jauntily and

spryly. In one moment, in one second, Mr. Gilman had

grown at least twenty years younger.
“Captain Wyatt,” he presented the skipper to the

ladies. “And this is Mr. Price, my secretary, and Doctor

Cromarty,” as two youths, clothed exactly to match Mr.

Gilman, followed the skipper up the steep incline of the

gangway.
And now Audrey could see the Ariadne lying below, for

it was only just past low water and the tide was scarcely

making. At the next berth higher up, with lights gleaming

at her innumerable portholes and two cranes hard at work

producing a mighty racket on her, lay a Channel steamer,

which, by comparison with the yacht, loomed enormous, like

an Atlantic liner. Indeed, the yacht seemed a very little and

a very lowly and a very flimsy flotation on the dark water,

and her illuminated deck-house was no better than a toy.

On the other hand, her two masts rose out of the deep high

overhead and had a certain impressiveness, though not

quite enough.
Audrey thought:
“Is this what we’re going on? I thought it was a big

yacht.” And she had a qualm.
And then a bell rang twice, extremely sweet and mellow,

somewhere on the yacht. And Audrey was touched by the

beauty of its tone.
“Two bells. Nine o’clock,” said Mr. Gilman. “Will

you come aboard? I’ll show you the way.” He tripped

down the gangway like a boy. Behind could be heard the

sailors giving one another directions about the true method

of handling luggage.
Audrey had met Madame Piriac by sheer hazard in a

corset shop in the Rue de la Chaussée-d’Antin. The fugitive

from justice had been obliged, in the matter of wardrobe,

to begin life again on her arrival trunkless in Paris, and

the business of doing so was not disagreeable. Madame

Piriac had greeted her with most affectionate warmth. One

of her first suggestions had been that Audrey should accompany

her on a short yachting trip projected by Mr. Gilman.

She had said that though the excellent Gilman was her

uncle, and her adored uncle, he was not her real uncle, and

that therefore, of course, she was incapable of going unaccompanied,

though she would hate to disappoint the dear

man. As for Monsieur Piriac, the destiny of France was in

his hands, and the moment being somewhat critical, he

would not quit the Ministry of Foreign Affairs without

leaving a fixed telegraphic address.
On the next day Mr. Gilman and Madame Piriac had

called on Audrey at the Hôtel du Danube, and the invitation

became formal. It was pressing and flattering. Why

refuse it? Mr. Gilman was obviously prepared to be her

slave. She accepted, with enthusiasm. And she said to

herself that in doing so she was putting yet another spoke

in the wheel of the British police. Immediately afterwards

she learnt that Musa also had been asked. Madame Piriac

informed her, in reply to a sort of protest, that Musa’s first

concert was postponed by the concert agency until the

autumn. “I never heard of that!” Audrey had cried.

“And why should you have heard of it? Have you not

been in England?” Madame Piriac had answered, a little

surprised at Audrey’s tone. Whereupon Audrey had said

naught. The chief point was that Musa could take a holiday

without detriment to his career. Moreover, Mr. Gilman,

who possessed everything, possessed a marvellous violin,

which he would put at the disposal of Musa on the yacht if

Musa’s own violin had not been found in the meantime.

The official story was that Musa’s violin had been mislaid or

lost on the Métropolitain Railway, and the fact that he had

been to England somehow did not transpire at all.
Mr. Gilman had gone forward in advance to make sure

that his yacht was in a state worthy to receive two such

ladies, and he had insisted on meeting them in his car

at Abbeville on the way to Boulogne. He had not insisted

on meeting Musa similarly. He was a peculiar and in

some respects a stiff-necked man. He had decided, in his

own mind, that he would have the two women to himself

in the car, and so indeed it fell out. Nevertheless his attitude

to Musa, and Madame Piriac’s attitude to Musa, and

everybody’s attitude to Musa, had shown that the mere

prospect of star-concerts in a first-class hall had very

quickly transformed Musa into a genuine Parisian lion. He

was positively courted. His presence on the yacht was

deemed an honour, and that was why Mr. Gilman had asked

him. Audrey both resented the remarkable change and was

proud of it—as a mother perhaps naturally would do and

be. The admitted genius was to arrive the next morning.
On boarding the Ariadne in the wake of Mr. Gilman and

Madame Piriac, the first thing that impressed Audrey was

the long gangway itself. It was made of thin resilient steel,

and the handrails were of soft white rope, almost like silk,

and finished off with fancy knots; and at the beginning of

the gangway, on the dirty quay, lay a beautiful mat bearing

the name of the goddess, while at the end, on the pale,

smooth deck, was another similar mat. The obvious costliness

of that gangway and those superlative mats made

Audrey feel poor, in spite of her ten million francs. And

the next thing that impressed her was that immediately she

got down on deck the yacht, in a very mysterious manner,

had grown larger, and much larger. At the forward extremity

of the deck certain blue figures lounging about

seemed to be quite a long way off, indeed in another world.

Here and there on the deck were circles of yellow or white

rope, coiled as precisely and perfectly as Audrey could coil

her own hair. Mr. Gilman led them to the door of the deck-house

and they gazed within. The sight of the interior

drew out of the ravished Audrey an ecstatic exclamation:

“What a darling!” And at the words she saw that Mr.

Gilman, for all his assumed nonchalant spryness, almost

trembled with pleasure. The deck-house was a drawing-room

whose walls were of carved and inlaid wood. Orange-shaded

electric bulbs hung on short, silk cords from the

ceiling, and flowers in sconces showed brilliantly between

the windows, which were draped with curtains of silk matching

the thick carpet. Several lounge chairs and a table of

bird’s-eye maple completed the place, and over the table

were scattered newspapers and illustrated weeklies. Everything,

except the literature, was somewhat diminished in

size, but the smallness of the scale only intensified the

pleasure derived from the spectacle.
Then they went “downstairs,” as Audrey said; but Mr.

Gilman corrected her and said “below,” whereupon Audrey

retorted that she should call it the “ground floor,” and Mr.

Gilman laughed as she had never heard a man of his age

laugh. The sight of the ground floor still further increased

Audrey’s notion of the dimensions of the yacht, whose corridors

and compartments appeared to stretch away endlessly

in two directions. At the foot of the curving staircase Mr.

Gilman, pulling aside a curtain, announced: “This is the

saloon.” When she heard the word Audrey expected a

poky cubicle, but found a vast drawing-room with more

books than she had ever seen in any other drawing-room,

many pictures, an open piano, with music on it; sofas in

every quarter, and about a thousand cupboards and drawers,

each with a silver knob or handle. Above all was a dome of

multi-coloured glass, and exactly beneath the dome a table

set for supper, with the finest napery, cutlery and crystal.

The apartment was dazzlingly lighted, and yet not a single

lamp could be detected in the act of illumination. A real

parlourmaid suddenly appeared at the far end of the room,

and behind her two stewards in gilt-buttoned white Eton

jackets and black trousers. Mr. Gilman, with seriousness,

bade the parlourmaid take charge of the ladies and show

them the sleeping-cabins.
“Choose any cabins you like,” said he, as Madame

Piriac and Audrey rustled off.
There might have been hundreds of sleeping-cabins. And

there did, in fact, appear to be quite a number of them,

to say nothing of two bathrooms. They inspected all of

them save one, which was locked. In an awed voice the

parlourmaid said, “That is the owner’s cabin.” At another

door she said, in a different, disdainful voice, “That only

leads to the galley and the crew’s quarters.” Audrey

wondered what a galley could be, and the mystery of that

name, and the mystery of the two closed doors, merely made

the whole yacht perfect. The sleeping-cabins surpassed all

else—they were so compact, so complex, so utterly complete.

No large bedchamber, within Audrey’s knowledge, held so

much apparatus, and offered so much comfort and so much

wardrobe room as even the least of these cabins. It was

impossible, to be sure, that in one’s amused researches one

had not missed a cupboard ingeniously disguised somewhere.

And the multiplicity of mirrors, and the message of the

laconic monosyllable “Hot” on silver taps, and the discretion

of the lighting, all indicated that the architect and

creator of these marvellous microcosms had “understood.”

The cosy virtue of littleness, and the entire absurdity of

space for the sake of space, were strikingly proved, and

the demonstration amounted, in Audrey’s mind, to a new and

delicious discovery.
The largest of the cabins had two berths at right angles

to one another, each a lovely little bed with a running screen

of cashmere. Having admired it once, they returned to it.
“Do you know, my dear,” said Madame Piriac in

French, “I have an idea. You will tell me if it is not

good.... If we shared this cabin ...! In this so curious

machine one feels a satisfaction, somehow, in being very

near the one to the other. The ceiling is so low.... That

gives you sensations—human sensations.... I know not

if you experience the same....”
“Oh! Let’s!” Audrey exclaimed impulsively in

English. “Do let’s!”
When the parlourmaid had gone, and before the luggage

had come down, Madame Piriac caught Audrey to her and

kissed her fervently on both cheeks, amid the glinting confusion

of polished woods and draperies and silver mountings

and bevelled glass.
“I am so content that you came, my little one!”

murmured Madame Piriac.
The next minute the cabin and the corridor outside were

full of open trunks and bags, over which bent the forms of

Madame Piriac, Audrey and the parlourmaid. And all the

drawers were gaping, and the doors of all the cupboards

swinging, and the narrow beds were hidden under piles of

variegated garments. And while they were engaged in the

breathless business of installing themselves in the celestial

domain, strange new thoughts flitted about like mice in

Audrey’s head. She felt as though she were in a refuge

from the world, and as though her conscience was being

narcotised. In that cabin, firm as solid land and yet floating

on the water, with Mr. Gilman at hand her absolute slave—in

that cabin the propaganda of women’s suffrage presented

itself as a very odd and very remote phenomenon, a phenomenon

scarcely real. She had positively everything she

wanted without fighting for it. The lion’s share of life was

hers. Comfort and luxury were desirable and beautiful

things, not to be cast aside nor scorned. Madame Piriac

was a wise woman and a good woman. She was a happy

woman.... There was a great deal of ugliness in sitting

on Joy Wheels and being chased by policemen. True, as she

had heard, a crew of nineteen human beings was necessary

to the existence of Mr. Gilman and his guests on board the

yacht. Well, what then? The nineteen were undoubtedly

well treated and in clover. And the world was the world;

you had to take it as you found it.... And then in her

mind she had a glimpse of the blissful face of Jane Foley—blissful

in a different way from any other face she had met

in all her life. Disconcerting, this glimpse, for an instant,

but only for an instant! She, Audrey, was blissful, too.

The intense desire for joy and pleasure surged up in her....

The bell which she had previously heard struck three;

its delicate note vibrated long through the yacht, unwilling

to expire. Half-past nine, and supper and the chivalry of

Mr. Gilman waiting for them in the elegance of the saloon!
As the two women approached the portière which

screened the forward entrance to the saloon, they heard

Mr. Gilman say, in a weary and resigned voice:
“Well, I suppose there’s nothing better than a whisky

and soda.”
And the vivacious reply of a steward:
“Very good, sir.”
The owner was lounging in a corner, with a gloomy,

bored look on his face. But as soon as the portière stirred

and he saw the smiles of Madame Piriac and Audrey upon

him, his whole demeanour changed in an instant. He

sprang up, laughed, furtively smoothed his waistcoat, and

managed to convey the general idea that he had a keen

interest in life, and that the keenest part of that interest

was due to a profound instinctive desire to serve these two

beautiful benefactors of mankind—the idea apparently being

that the charming creatures had conferred a favour on the

human race by consenting to exist. He cooed round them,

he offered them cushions, he inquired after their physical

condition, he expressed his fear lest the cabins had not

contained every convenience that caprice might expect. He

was excited; surely he was happy! Audrey persuaded herself

that this must, after all, be his true normal condition

while aboard the yacht, and that the ennui visible on his

features a moment earlier could only have been transient and

accidental.
“I am sure the piano is as wonderful as all else on

board,” said Madame Piriac.
“Do play!” he entreated. “I love to hear music here.

My secretary plays for me when I am alone.”
“I, who do not adore music!” Madame Piriac protested

against the invitation. But she sat down on the clamped

music stool and began a waltz.
“Ah!” said Mr. Gilman, dropping into a seat by Audrey.

“I wish I danced!”
“But you don’t mean to say you don’t,” said Audrey,

with fascination. She felt that she could fascinate him, and

that it was her duty to fascinate him.
Mr. Gilman responded to the challenge.
“I suppose I do,” he said modestly. “We must have a

dance on deck one night. I’ll tell my secretary to get the

gramophone into order. I have a pretty good one.”
“How lovely!” Audrey agreed. “I do think the

Ariadne’s the most heavenly thing, Mr. Gilman! I’d no

idea what a yacht was! I hope you’ll tell me the proper

names for all the various parts—you know what I mean.

I hate to use the wrong words. It’s not polite on a yacht,

is it?”
His smile was entranced.
“You and I will go round by ourselves to-morrow morning,

Mrs. Moncreiff,” he said.
Just then the steward appeared with the whisky and

soda, but Mr. Gilman dismissed him with a sharp gesture,

and he vanished back into the unexplored parts of the

vessel. The implication was that the society of Audrey

made whisky and soda a superfluity for Mr. Gilman.

Although she was so young, he treated her with exactly

the same deference as he lavished on Madame Piriac,

indeed with perhaps a little more. If Madame Piriac was

for him the incarnation of sweetness and balm and majesty,

so also was Audrey, and Audrey had the advantage of

novelty. She was growing, morally, every minute. The

confession of Musa had filled her with a good notion of

herself. The impulsive flattery of Madame Piriac in the

joint cabin, and now the sincere, grave homage of Mr. Gilman,

caused her to brim over with consciousness that she

was at last somebody.
An automobile hooted on the quay, and at the disturbing

sound Madame Piriac ceased to play and swung round on

the stool.
“That—that must be our other lady guest,” said Mr.

Gilman, who had developed nervousness; his cheeks flushed

darkly.
“Ah?” cautiously smiled Madame Piriac, who was

plainly taken aback.
“Yes,” said Mr. Gilman. “Miss Thompkins. Before I

knew for certain that Mrs. Moncreiff could come with you,

Hortense, I asked Miss Thompkins if she would care to

come. I only got her answer this morning—it was delayed.

I meant to tell you.... You are a friend of Miss Thompkins,

aren’t you?” He turned to Audrey.
Audrey replied gaily that she knew Tommy very well.
“I’d better go up,” said Mr. Gilman, and he departed,

and his back, though a nervous back, seemed to be defying

Madame Piriac and Audrey to question in the slightest

degree his absolute right to choose his own guests on his

own yacht.
“Strange man!” muttered Madame Piriac. It was a

confidence to Audrey, who eagerly accepted it as such.

“Imagine him inviting Mees Thompkins without a word to

us, without a word! But, you know, my dear uncle was

always bizarre, mysterious. Yet—is he mysterious, or is

he ingenuous?”
“But how did he come to know Miss Thompkins?”

Audrey demanded.
“Ah! You have not heard that? Miss Thompkins gave

a—a musical tea in her studio, to celebrate these concerts

which are to occur. Musa asked the Foas to come. They

consented. It was understood they should bring friends.

Thus I went also, and Monsieur Gilman being at my orders

that afternoon, he went too. Never have I seen so strange

a multitude! But it was amusing. And all Paris has begun

to talk of Musa. Miss Thompkins and my uncle became

friends on the instant. I assume that it was her eyes. Also

those Americans have vivacity, if not always distinction.

Do you not think so?”
“Oh, yes! And do you mean to say that on the strength

of that he asked her to go yachting?”
“Well, he had called several times.”
“Aren’t you surprised she accepted?” asked Audrey.
“No,” said Madame Piriac. “It is another code, that

is all. It is a surprise, but she will be amusing.”
“I’m sure she will,” Audrey concurred. “I’m frightfully

fond of her myself.”
They glanced at each other very intimately, like long-established

allies who fear an aggression—and are ready

for it.
Then steps were heard. Miss Thompkins entered.
“Well,” drawled Miss Thompkins, gazing first at

Audrey and then at Madame Piriac. “Of all the loveliest

shocks——Say, Musa——”
Behind her stood Musa. It appeared that he had been

able to get away by the same train as Tommy.

CHAPTER XXXI
THE NOSTRUM
The hemisphere of heaven was drenched in moonlight, and—rare

happening either on British earth or on the waters

surrounding it, in mid-summer—the night was warm. In

the midst of the glittering sea the yacht moved without the

appearance of motion; only by leaning over the rail and

watching the bubbles glide away from her could you detect

her progress. There were no waves, no ripples, nothing

but a scarcely perceptible swell. The gentle breeze, unnoticeable

on deck, was abaft; all the sails had been

lowered and stowed except the large square sail bent on a

yard to the mainmast and never used except with such a

wind. The Ariadne had a strong flood tide under her, and

her 200-h.p. twin motors were stopped. Hence there

was no tremor in the ship and no odour of paraffin in the

nostrils of those who chanced to wander aft of the engine-room.

The deck awning had been rolled up to the centre,

and at the four corners of its frame had been hung four

temporary electric lights within Chinese lanterns. A

radiance ascended from the saloon skylight; the windows

of the deck-house blazed as usual, but the deck-house was

empty; a very subdued glow indicated where the binnacle

was. And, answering these signs of existence, could be

distinguished the red and green lights of steamers, the firm

rays of lighthouses, and the red or white warnings of gas-buoys

run by clockwork.
The figures of men and women—the women in pale

gowns, the men in blue-and-white—lounged or strolled on

the spotless deck which unseen hands swabbed and stoned

every morning at 6 o’clock; and among these figures passed

the figure of a steward with a salver, staying them with

flagons, comforting them with the finest exotic fruit.

Occasionally the huge square sail gave an idle flap. “Get

that lead out, ’Orace,” commanded a grim voice from the

wheel. A splash followed, as a man straddled himself over

the starboard bow, swung a weighted line to and fro and

threw it from him. “Four.” Another splash. “Four.”

Another splash. “Four.” Another splash. “Three-half.”

Another splash. “Three-half.” Another splash. “Three.”

Another splash. “Two-half.” Another splash. “Three.”

Another splash. “Five.” “That’ll do, ’Orace,” came the

voice from the wheel. Then an entranced silence.
The scene had the air of being ideal. And yet it was

not. Something lacked. That something was the owner.

The owner lay indisposed in the sacred owner’s cabin. And

this was a pity because a dance had been planned for that

night. It might have taken place without the owner, but

the strains of the gramophone and especially the shuffling

of feet on the deck would have disturbed him. True, he

had sent up word by Doctor Cromarty that he was not to

be considered. But the doctor had delivered the message

without any conviction, and the unanimous decision was

that the owner must, at all costs, be considered.
It was Ostend, on top of the owner’s original offer to

Audrey, that had brought about the suggestion of a dance.

They had coasted up round Gris-Nez from Boulogne to

Ostend, and had reached the harbour there barely in time

to escape from the worst of a tempest that had already

begun to produce in the minds of sundry passengers a grave

doubt whether yachting was, after all, the most delightful

of pursuits. Some miles before the white dome of the

Kursaal was sighted the process of moral decadence had set

in, and passengers were lying freely to each other, and

boastfully lying, just as though somebody had been accusing

them of some dreadful crime of cowardice or bad breeding

instead of merely inquiring about the existence of physical

symptoms over which they admittedly had no control whatever.

The security of a harbour, with a railway station not

fifty yards from the yacht’s bowsprit, had restored them,

by dint of calming secret fears, to their customary condition

of righteousness and rectitude. Several days of

gusty rainstorms had elapsed at Ostend, and the passengers

had had the opportunity to study the method of managing

a yacht, and to visit the neighbourhood. The one was as

wondrous as the other. They found letters and British and

French newspapers on their plates at breakfast. And the

first object they had seen on the quay, and the last object

they saw there, was the identical large limousine which they

had left on the quay at Boulogne. It would have taken

them to Ghent but for the owner’s powerful objection to

their eating any meal off the yacht. Seemingly he had a

great and sincere horror of local viands and particularly of

local water. He was their slave; they might demand anything

from him; he was the very symbol of hospitality and

chivalry, but somehow they could not compass a meal

away from the yacht. Similarly, he would have them leave

the Kursaal not later than ten o’clock, when the evening had

not veritably begun. They did not clearly understand by

what means he imposed his will, but he imposed it.
The departure from Ostend was accomplished after the

glass had begun to rise, but before it had finished rising, and

there were apprehensions in the saloon and out of it, when

the spectacle of the open sea, and the feel of it under the

feet, showed that, as of old, water was still unstable. The

process of moral decadence would have set in once more

but for the prudence and presence of mind of Audrey, who

had laid in a large stock of the specific which had been of

such notable use to herself and Miss Ingate on previous

occasions. Praising openly its virtues, confessing frankly

her own weakness and preaching persuasively her own

faith, she had distributed the nostrum, and in about a

quarter of an hour had established a justifiable confidence.

Mr. Gilman alone would not partake, and indeed she had

hardly dared to offer the thing to so experienced a sailor.

The day had favoured her. The sea grew steadily more

tranquil, and after skirting the Belgian and French coasts

for some little distance the Ariadne, under orders, had

turned her nose boldly northward for the estuary of the

Thames. The Ariadne was now in the midst of that very

complicated puzzle of deeps and shallows. The passengers,

in fact, knew that they were in the region of the North

Edinburgh, but what or where the North Edinburgh was

they had only the vaguest idea. The blot on the voyage

had been the indisposition of Mr. Gilman, who had taken

to his berth early, and who saw nobody but his doctor,

through whom he benignantly administered the world of the

yacht. Doctor Cromarty had a face which imparted nothing

and yet implied everything. He said less and meant more

than even the average pure-blooded Scotsman. It was

imparted that Mr. Gilman had a chronic complaint. The

implications were vast and baffling.
“We shall dance after all,” said Miss Thompkins, bending

with a mysterious gesture over Audrey, who reclined in

a deck-chair near the companion leading to the deserted

engine-room. Miss Thompkins was dressed in lacy white,

with a string of many tinted beads round her slim neck.

Her tawny hair was arranged in a large fluffiness, and the

ensemble showed to a surprised Audrey what Miss

Thompkins could accomplish when she deemed the occasion

to be worthy of an effort.
“Shall we? What makes you think so, dear?” absently

asked Audrey, in whom the scene had induced profound

reflections upon life and the universe.
“He’ll come up on deck,” said Miss Thompkins, disclosing

her teeth in an inscrutable smile that the moonbeams

made more strange than it actually was. “Like to know

how I know? Sure you’d like to know, Mrs. Simplicity?”

Her beads rattled above Audrey’s insignificant upturned

nose. “Isn’t a yacht the queerest little self-contained state

you ever visited? It’s as full of party politics as

Massachusetts; and that’s some. Well, I didn’t use all my

medicine you gave me. Didn’t need it. So I’ve shared it

with him. I got the empty packet with all the instructions

on it, and I put two of my tablets in it, and if he hasn’t

swallowed them by this time my name isn’t Anne Tuckett

Thompkins.”
“But you don’t mean he’s been——”
“Audrey, you’re making a noise like a goose. ’Course

I do.”
“But how did you manage to——”
“I gave them to Mr. Price, with instructions to leave

them by the—er—bedside. Mr. Price is a friend. I hope

I’ve made that plain these days to everybody, including Mr.

Gilman. Mr. Price is a good sample of what painters are

liable to come to after they’ve found out they don’t care

for the smell of oil-tubes. I knew him when he always

said ‘Puvis’ instead of ‘Puvis de Chavannes.’ He’s cured

now. If I hadn’t happened to know he’d be on board I

shouldn’t have dared to come. He’s my lifebuoy.”
“But I assure you, Tommy, Mr. Gilman refused the

stuff from me. He did.”
“Oh! Dove! Wood-pigeon! Of course he refused it.

He was bound to. Owner of a two-hundred-and-fifty-ton

yacht taking a remedy for sea-sickness in public on the

two-hundred-and-fifty-ton yacht! The very idea makes you

shiver. But he’ll take it down there. And he won’t ask

any questions. And he’ll hide it from the doctor. And

he’ll pretend, and he’ll expect everybody else to pretend,

that he’s never been within a mile of the stuff.”
“Tommy, I don’t believe you.”
“And he’s a lovely man, all the same.”
“Tommy, I don’t believe you.”
“Yes, you do. You’d like not to, but you can’t help it.

I sometimes do bruise people badly in their organ of

illusions-about-human-nature, but it is fun, after all,

isn’t it?”
“What?”
“Getting down to the facts.”
Accompanied by the tattoo of her necklace, Miss

Thompkins moved away in the direction of Madame Piriac,

who was engaged with Musa.
“Admit I’m rather brilliant to-night,” she threw over

her shoulder.
The dice seem to be always loaded in favour of the

Misses Thompkins of society. Less than a quarter of an

hour later Doctor Cromarty, showing his head just above

the level of the deck, called out:
“Price, ye can wind up that box o’ yours. Mr. Gilman

is coming on deck. He’s wonderful better.”

CHAPTER XXXII
BY THE BINNACLE
The owner was at the wheel. But he had not got there

at once. This singular man, who strangely enough was

wearing one of his most effulgent and heterogeneous club

neckties, had begun by dancing. He danced with all three

ladies, one after the other; and he did not merely dance—he

danced modernly, he danced the new dances to the new

tunes, given off like intoxicating gas from the latest of

gramophones. He knew how to hold the arm of a woman

above her head, while coiling his own around it in the

manner of a snake, and he knew how to make his very

body a vast syncopation. The effect of his arrival was as

singular as himself. Captain Wyatt, Doctor Cromarty and

Mr. Price withdrew to that portion of the deck about the

wheel which convention had always roped off for them with

invisible ropes. The captain, by custom, messed by himself,

whereas the other two had their meals in the saloon,

entering and leaving quickly and saying little while at table.

But apart from meals the three formed a separate clan on

the yacht. The indisposition of the owner had dissolved

this clan into the general population of the saloon. The

recovery of the owner re-created it. Mr. Price had suddenly

begun to live arduously for the gramophone alone.

And when summoned by the owner to come and form half

of the third couple for dancing, Doctor Cromarty had the

air of arousing himself from a meditation upon medicine.

Also, the passengers themselves danced with conscientiousness,

with elaborate gusto and with an earnest desire to

reach a high standard. And between dances everybody

went up to Mr. Gilman and said how lovely it all was. And

it really was lovely.
Mr. Gilman had taken the wheel after about the sixth

dance. Approaching Audrey, who owed him the next dance,

he had said that the skipper had hinted something about his

taking the wheel and he thought he had better oblige the

old fellow, if Audrey was quite, quite sure she didn’t mind,

and would she come and sit by him instead—for one dance?

... As soon as two sailors had fixed cushions for Audrey,

and the skipper had given the owner the course, all persons

seemed to withdraw respectfully from the pair, who were

in the shadow of a great spar, with the glimmer of the

binnacle just in front of them. The square sail had been

lowered, and the engines started, and a steady, faint throb

kept the yacht mysteriously alive in every plank of her.

The gramophone and the shuffle of feet continued, because

Mr. Gilman had expressly desired that his momentary

defection with a lady and in obedience to duty should not

bring the ball to an end. Laughter and even giggles came

from the ballroom. Males were dancing together. The

power of the moon had increased. The binnacle-light, however,

threw up a radiance of its own on to Mr. Gilman’s

lowered face, the face of a kind, a good, and a dependably

expert individuality who was watching over the

safety, the welfare and the highest interests of every soul

on board.
“I was very sorry to be laid up to-day,” Mr. Gilman

began suddenly, in a very quiet voice, frowning benevolently

at the black pointer on the compass. “But, of

course, you know my great enemy.”
“No, I don’t,” said Audrey gently.
“Hasn’t Doc told you?”
“Doctor Cromarty? No, he doesn’t tell much.”
“Well,” said Mr. Gilman, looking round quickly and

shyly, rather in the manner of a boy, “it’s liver.”
Audrey seemed to read in his face, first, that Doctor

Cromarty had received secret orders never to tell anybody

anything, and, second, that the great enemy was not liver.

And she thought: “So this is human nature! Mature

men, wise men, dignified men, do descend to these paltry

deceits just in order to keep up appearances, though they

must know quite well that they don’t deceive anyone who

is worth deceiving.” The remarkable fact was that she

did not feel in the least shocked or disdainful. She merely

decided—and found a certain queer pleasure in the decision—that

human nature was a curious phenomenon, and that

there must be a lot of it on earth. And she felt kindly

towards Mr. Gilman.
“If you’d said gout——” she remarked. “I always

understood that men generally had gout.” And she consciously,

with intention, employed a simple, innocent tone,

knowing that it misled Mr. Gilman, and wanting it to

mislead him.
“No!” he went on. “Liver. All sailors suffer from

it, more or less. It’s the bugbear of the sea. I have a

doctor on board because, with a score or so of crew, it’s

really a duty to have a doctor.”
“I quite see that,” Audrey agreed, thinking mildly:

“You only have a doctor on board because you’re always

worrying about your own health.”
“However,” said Mr. Gilman, “he’s not much use to

me personally. He doesn’t understand liver. Scotsmen

never do. Fortunately, I have a very good doctor in Paris.

I prefer French doctors. And I’m sure they’re right on the

great liver question. All English doctors tell you to take

plenty of violent exercise if you want to shake off a liver

attack. Quite wrong. Too much exercise tires the body

and so it tires the liver as well—obviously. What’s the

result? You can see, can’t you? The liver works worse

than ever. Now, a French doctor will advise complete rest

until the attack is over. Then exercise, if you like; but not

before. Of course, you don’t know you’ve got a liver, and

I dare say you think it’s very odd of me to talk about my

liver. I’m sure you do.”
“I don’t, honestly. I like you to talk like that. It’s

very interesting.” And she thought: “Suppose Tommy

was wrong, after all! ... She’s very spiteful.”
“That’s you all over, Mrs. Moncreiff. You understand

men far better than any other woman I ever saw, unless,

perhaps, it’s Madame Piriac.”
“Oh, Mr. Gilman! How can you say such a thing?”
“It’s not the first time you’ve heard it, I wager!” said

Mr. Gilman. “And it won’t be the last! Any man who

knows women can see at once that you are one of the

women who understand. Otherwise, do you imagine I

should have begun upon my troubles?”
Now, at any rate, he was sincere—she was convinced

of that. And he looked very smart as he spied the horizon

for lights and peered at the compass, and moved the wheel

at intervals with a strong, accustomed gesture. And,

assuredly, he looked very experienced. Audrey blushed.

She just had to believe that there must be something in

what he said concerning her talent. She had noticed it herself

several times.
In an interval of the music the sea washed with a long

sound against the bow of the yacht; then silence.
“I do love that sudden wash against the yacht,” said

Audrey.
“Yes,” agreed Mr. Gilman, “so do I. All doctors tell

me that I should be better if I gave up yachting. But I

won’t. I couldn’t. Whatever it costs in health, yachting’s

worth it.”
“Oh! It must be!” cried Audrey, with enthusiasm.

“I’ve never been on a yacht before, but I quite agree with

you. I feel as if I could live on a yacht for ever—always

going to new places, you know; that’s how I feel.”
“You do?” Mr. Gilman exclaimed and gazed at her for

a moment with a sort of ecstasy. Audrey instinctively

checked herself. “There’s a freemasonry among those

who like yachting.” His eyes returned to the compass.

“I’ve kept your secret. I’ve kept it like something precious.

I’ve enjoyed keeping it. It’s been a comfort to me. Now

I wonder if you’ll do the same for me, Mrs. Moncreiff?”
“Do what?” Audrey asked weakly, intimidated.
“Keep a secret. I shouldn’t dream of telling it to

Madame Piriac. Will you? May I tell you?”
“Yes, if you think you can trust me,” said Audrey, concealing,

with amazing ease and skill, her excitement and

her mighty pleasure in the scene.... “He wouldn’t dream

of telling it to Madame Piriac.” ... It is doubtful whether

she had ever enjoyed anything so much, and yet she was

as prim as a nun.
“I’m not a happy man, Mrs. Moncreiff. Materially, I’ve

everything a man can want, I suppose. But I’m not happy.

You may laugh and say it’s my liver. But it isn’t. You’re

a woman of the world; you know what life is; and yet

experience hasn’t spoilt you. I could say anything

to you; anything! And you wouldn’t be shocked, would

you?”
“No,” said Audrey, hoping, nevertheless, that he would

not say “anything, anything,” but somehow simultaneously

hoping that he would. It was a disconcerting sensation.
“I want you always to remember that I’m unhappy and

never to tell anybody,” Mr. Gilman resumed.
“But why?”
“It will be a kindness to me.”
“I mean, why are you unhappy?”
“My opinions have all changed. I used to think I could

be independent of women. Not that I didn’t like women!

I did. But when I’d left them I was quite happy. You

know what the facts of life are, Mrs. Moncreiff. Young as

you are you are older than me in some respects, though I

have a long life before me. It’s just because I have a long

life before me—dyspeptics are always long-lived—that I’m

afraid for the future. It wouldn’t matter so much if I was

an old man.”
“But,” asked Audrey adventurously, “why should you

be unhappy because your opinions have changed? What

opinions?” She endeavoured to be perfectly judicial and

indifferent, and yet kind.
“What opinions? Well, about Woman Suffrage, for

instance. You remember that night at the Foas’, and

what I remarked afterwards about what you all said?”
“Yes, I remember,” said Audrey. “But can you

remember it? Fancy you remembering a thing like that!”
“I remember every word that was said. It changed me....

Not at first. Oh, no! Not for several days, perhaps

weeks. I fought against it. Then I said to myself, ‘How

absurd to fight against it!’ ... Well, I’ve come to believe

in women having the vote. You’ve no more stanch supporter

than I am. I want women to have the vote. And

you’re the first person I’ve ever said that to. I want you

to have the vote.”
He smiled at her, and she saw scores and scores of

excellent qualities in his smile; she could not believe that

he had any defect whatever. His secret was precious to

her. She considered that he had confided it to her in a

manner both distinguished and poetical. He had shown a

quality which no youth could have shown. Youths were

inferior, crude, incomplete. Not that Mr. Gilman was not

young! Emphatically he was young, but her conception

of the number of years comprised in youthfulness had been

enlarged. She saw, as in a magical enlightenment, that

forty was young, fifty was young, any age was young provided

it had the right gestures. As for herself, she was

without age. The obvious fact that Mr. Gilman was her

slave touched her; it saddened her, but sweetly; it gave her

a new sense of responsibility.
She said:
“I still don’t see why this change of view should make

you unhappy. I should have thought it would have just the

opposite effect.”
“It has altered all my desires,” he replied. “Do you

know, I’m not really interested in this new yacht now! And

that’s the truth.”
“Mr. Gilman!” she checked him. “How can you say

such a thing?”
It now appeared that she was not a nice girl. If she

had been a nice girl she would not have comprehended

what Mr. Gilman was ultimately driving at. The word

“marriage” would never have sounded in her brain. And

she would have been startled and shocked had Mr. Gilman

even hinted that there was such a word in the dictionary.

But not being, after all, a nice girl, she actually dwelt on

the notion of marriage with somebody exactly like Mr.

Gilman. She imagined how fine and comfortable and final

it would be. She admitted that despite her riches and her

independence she would be and could be simply naught until

she possessed a man and could show him to the world as

her own. Strange attitude for a wealthy feminist, but she

had the attitude! And, moreover, she enjoyed having it;

she revelled in it. She desired, impatiently, that Mr.

Gilman should proceed further. She thirsted for his next

remark. And her extremely deceptive features displayed

only a blend of simplicity and soft pity. Those features did

not actually lie, for she was ingenuous without being aware

of it and her pity for the fellow-creature whose lot she could

assuage with a glance was real enough. But they did

suppress about nine-tenths of the truth.
“I tell you,” said Mr. Gilman, “there is nothing I could

not say to you. And—and—of course, you’ll say I scarcely

know you—yet——”
Clearly he was proceeding further. She waited as

in a theatre one waits for a gun to go off on the stage.

And then the gun did go off, but not the gun she was

expecting.
Skipper Wyatt’s head popped up like a cannon shot out

of a hole in the forward deck, and it gazed sharply and

apprehensively around the calm, moonlit sea. Mr. Gilman

was, beyond question, perturbed by the movements of that

head, though he could not see the expression of the eyes.

This was the first phenomenon. The second phenomenon

was a swirling of water round the after part of the ship, and

this swirling went on until the water was white with a thin

foam.
“Reverse those d——d engines!” shouted Captain

Wyatt, quite regardless of the proximity of refined women.

He had now sprung clear of the hole and was running aft.

The whole world of the yacht could not but see that he was

coatless and that his white shirtsleeves, being rather long,

were kept in position by red elastic rings round his arms.

“Is that blithering engineer asleep?” continued Captain

Wyatt, ignoring the whole system of yacht etiquette.

“She’s getting harder on every second!”
“Ay, ay, skipper!” came a muffled voice from the engine-room.
“And not too soon either!” snapped the captain.
The yacht throbbed more violently; the swirling increased

furiously. The captain stared over the rail. Then,

after an interval, he stamped on the deck in disgust.
“Shut off!” he yelled. “It’s no good.”
The yacht ceased to throb. The swirling came to an

end, and the thin white foam faded into flat sombre water.

Whereupon Captain Wyatt turned back to the wheel, which,

in his extreme haste, he had passed by.
“You’ve run her on to the sand, sir,” said he to Mr.

Gilman, respectfully but still accusingly.
“Oh, no! Impossible!” Mr. Gilman defended himself,

pained by the charge.
“She’s hard on, anyhow, sir. And many a good yacht’s

left her bones on this Buxey.”
“But you gave me the course,” protested Mr. Gilman,

with haughtiness.
Captain Wyatt bent down and looked at the binnacle.

He was contentedly aware that the compass of a yacht hard

aground cannot lie and cannot be made to lie. The camera

can lie; the speedometer of an automobile after an accident

can lie—or can conceal the truth and often does, but the

compass of a yacht aground is insusceptible to any

blandishment; it shows the course at the moment of striking

and nothing will persuade it to alter its evidence.
“What course did I give you, sir?” asked Captain

Wyatt.
And as Mr. Gilman hesitated in his reply, the skipper

pointed silently to the compass.
“Where’s the chart? Let me see the chart,” said Mr.

Gilman with sudden majesty.
The chart in its little brass frame was handy. Mr.

Gilman examined it in a hostile manner; one might say that

he cross-examined it, and with it the horizon. “Ah!” he

muttered at length, peering at the print under the chart,

“‘Corrected 1906.’ Out of date. Pity they don’t re-issue

these charts oftener.”
His observations had no relation whatever to the matter

in hand; considered as a contribution to the unravelling of

the matter in hand they were merely idiotic. Nevertheless,

such were the exact words he uttered, and he appeared to

get great benefit and solace from them. They somehow

enabled him to meet, quite satisfactorily, the gaze of his

guests who had now gathered in the vicinity of the wheel.
Audrey alone showed a desire to move away from the

wheel. The fact was that the skipper had glanced at her

in a peculiar way and his eyes had seemed to say, with

disdain: “Women! Women again!” Nothing but that!

The implications, however, were plain. Audrey may have

been discountenanced by the look in the captain’s eyes, but

at the same time she had an inward pride, because it was

undeniable that Mr. Gilman, owing to his extreme and

agitated interest in herself, had put the yacht off the course

and was thereby imperilling numerous lives. Audrey liked

that. And she exonerated Mr. Gilman, and she hated the

captain for daring to accuse him, and she mysteriously

nursed the wounded dignity of Mr. Gilman far better than

he could nurse it himself.
Her feelings were assuredly complex, and they grew

more complex when the sense of danger began to dominate

them. The sense of danger came to her out of the

demeanour of her companions and out of the swift appearance

on deck of every member of the crew, including the

parlourmaid, and including three men who were incompletely

clothed. The yacht was no longer a floating hotel,

automobile and dancing-saloon; it was a stranded wreck.

Not a passenger on board knew whether the tide was

making or ebbing, but, secretly, all were convinced that it

was ebbing and that they would be left on the treacherous

sand and ultimately swallowed up therein, even if a storm

did not supervene and smash the craft to bits in the classical

manner. The skipper’s words about the bones of many a

good yacht had escaped no ear.
Further, not a passenger knew where the yacht was or

whither, exactly, she was bound or whether the glass was

rising or falling, for guests on yachts seldom concern themselves

about details. Of course, signals might be made to

passing ships, but signals were often, according to maritime

history, unheeded, and the ocean was very large and empty,

though it was only the German Ocean.... Musa was

nervous and angry. Audrey knew from her intimate knowledge

of him that he was angry and she wondered why he

should be angry. Madame Piriac, on the other hand, was

entirely calm. Her calmness seemed to say to those

responsible, and even to the not-responsible passenger:

“You got me into this and it is inconceivable that you should

not get me out of it. I have always been looked after and

protected, and I must be looked after and protected now.

I absolutely decline to be worried.” But Miss Thompkins

was worried, she was very seriously alarmed; fear was in

her face.
“I do think it’s a shame!” she broke out almost loudly,

in a trembling voice, to Audrey. “I do think it’s a shame

you should go flirting with poor Mr. Gilman when he’s steering.”

And she meant all she said.
“Me flirting!” Audrey exclaimed, passionately resentful.
Withal, the sense of danger continued to increase. Still

there were the boats. There were the motor-launch, the

cutter and the dinghy. The sea was—for the present—calm

and the moon encouraging.
“Lower the dinghy there and look lively now!” cried

the captain.
This command more than ever frightened all the

passengers who, in their nervousness and alarm, had tried

to pretend to themselves that nervousness and alarm were

absurd, and that first-class yachts never did, and could not,

get wrecked. The command was a thunderstroke. It

proved that the danger was immediate and intense. And

the thought of all the beautiful food and drink on board,

and all the soft cushions and the electric hair-curlers and the

hot-water supply and the ice gave no consolation whatever.

The idea of the futility and wickedness of luxury desolated

the guests and made them austere, and yet even in that

moment they speculated upon what goods they might take

with them.
And why the dinghy, though it was a dinghy of large

size? Why not the launch?
After the dinghy had been dropped into the sea an old

sail was carefully spread amidships over her bottom and she

was lugged, by her painter, towards the bow of the yacht

where, with much grating of windlasses and of temperaments

and voices, an anchor was very gently lowered into her and

rested on the old sail. The anchor was so immense that it

sank the dinghy up to Her gunwale, and then she was

rowed away to a considerable distance, a chain grinding

after her, and in due time the anchor was pitched with a

great splash into the water. The sound of orders and of

replies vibrated romantically over the surface of the water.

Then a windlass was connected with the engine, and the

passengers comprehended that the intention was to drag

the yacht off the sand by main force. The chain clacked

and strained horribly. The shouting multiplied, as though

the vessel had been a great beast that could be bullied into

obedience. The muscles of all passengers were drawn taut

in sympathy with the chain, and at length there was a lurch

and the chain gradually slackened.
“She’s off!” breathed the captain. “We’ve saved a

good half-hour.”
“She’d have floated off by herself,” said Mr. Gilman

grandly.
“Yes, sir,” said the captain. “But if it had happened

to be the ebb, sir—” He left it at that and began on a

new series of orders, embracing the dinghy, the engines, the

anchor and another anchor.
And all the passengers resumed their courage and their

ancient notions about the excellence of luxury, and came to

the conclusion that navigation was a very simple affair, and

in less than five minutes were sincerely convinced that they

had never known fear.
Later, the impressive sight was witnessed of Madame

Piriac, on her shoulders such a cloak as certainly had never

been seen on a yacht before, bearing Mr. Gilman’s valuable

violin like a jewel casket. She had found it below and

brought it up on deck.
The Ariadne, was now passing to port those twinkling

cities of delight, Clacton and Frinton, and the long pier of

Walton stretched out towards it, a string of topazes. The

moon was higher and brighter than ever, but clouds had

heaped themselves up to windward, and the surface of the

water was rippled. Moreover, the yacht was now working

over a strong, foul tide. The company, with the exception

of Mr. Gilman, who had gone below—apparently in order

to avoid being on the same deck with Captain Wyatt—had

decided that Musa should be asked to play. Although the

sound of his practising had escaped occasionally through

the porthole of a locked cabin, he had not once during

the cruise performed for the public benefit. Dancing was

finished. Why should not the yacht profit by the presence

of a great genius on board? The doctor and the

secretary were of one mind with the women that there

was no good answer to this question, and even the crew

obviously felt that the genius ought to show what he was

made of.
“Dare we ask you?” said Madame Piriac to the youth,

offering him the violin case. Her supplicatory tone and

attitude, though they were somewhat assumed, proved to

what a height Musa had recently risen as a personage.
He hesitated, leaning against the rail and nervously

fingering it.
“I know it is a great deal to ask. But you would give

us so much pleasure,” said Madame Piriac.
Musa replied in a dry, curt voice:
“I should prefer not to play.”
“Oh! But Musa—” There was a general protest.
“I cannot play,” Musa exclaimed with impatience, and

moved almost savagely away.
The experience was novel for Madame Piriac, left

standing there, as it were, respectfully presenting the

violin case to the rail. This beautiful and not unpampered

lady was accustomed to see her commands received as an

honour; and when she condescended to implore, the effect

usually was to produce a blissful and deprecatory confusion

in the person besought. Her husband and Mr. Gilman had

for a number of years been teaching her that whatever

she desired was the highest good and the most complete

felicity to everybody concerned in the fulfilment of the

desire. She bore the blow from Musa admirably, keeping

both her smile and her dignity, and with one gesture

excusing Musa to all beholders as a capricious and a

sensitive artist in whom moodiness was lawful. It was

exquisitely done. It could not have been better done. But

not even Madame Piriac’s extreme skill could save the

episode from having the air of a social disaster. The

gaiety which had been too feverishly resumed after the

salvage of the yacht from the sandbank expired like a

pricked balloon. People silently vanished, and only Audrey

was left on the after deck.
It was after a long interval that she became aware

of the reappearance of Musa. Seemingly, he had been in

the engine-room; since the beginning of the cruise he had

shown a fancy for both the engine-room and the engineer.

To her surprise, he marched straight towards her deckchair.
“I must speak to you,” he said with emotion.
“Must you?” Audrey replied, full of hot resentment.

“I think you’ve been horrid, Musa. Perfectly horrid! But

I suppose you have your own notions of politeness now.

Everything has been done for you, and—”
“What is that?” he stopped her. “Everything has

been done for me. What is it that has been done for

me? I play for years, I am ignored. Then I succeed.

I am noticed. Men of affairs offer me immense sums.

But am I surprised? Not the least in the world. It is

the contrary which would have surprised me. It was

inevitable that I should succeed. But note well—it is I

myself who succeed. It is not my friends. It is not

the concert agent. Do I regard the concert agent as a

benefactor? Again, not the least in the world. You say

everything has been done for me. Nothing has been done

for me, Madame.”
“Yes, yes,” faltered Audrey, who was in a dilemma,

and therefore more resentful than ever. “I—I only mean

your friends have always stood by you.” She gathered

courage, sat up erect in her deck-chair, and finished

haughtily: “And now you’re conceited. You’re insufferably

conceited.”
“Because I refused to play?” He laughed stridently

and grimly. “No. I refused to play because I could

not, because I was outside myself with jealousy. Yes,

jealousy. You do not know jealousy. Perhaps you

are incapable of it. But permit me to tell you, Madame,

that jealousy is one of the finest and most terrible emotions.

And that is why I must speak to you. I cannot live

and see you flirt so seriously with that old idiot. I

cannot live.”
Audrey jumped up from the chair.
“Musa! I shall never speak to you again.... Me ...

flirt.... And you call Mr. Gilman an old idiot!”
“What words would you employ, Madame? He was

so agitated by your intimate conversation that he brought

us all near to death, in any case. Moreover, it jumps

to the eyes that the decrepit satyr is mad about you.

Mad!”
And Musa’s voice broke. In the midst of all her fury

Audrey was relieved that it did break, for the reason that

it was getting very loud, and the wheel, with Captain

Wyatt thereat, was not far off.
There was one thing to do, and Audrey did it. She

walked away rapidly. And, as she did so, she was startled

to discover a sob in her throat. The drawn, highly

emotionalised face of Musa remained with her. She was

angry, indignant, infuriated, and yet her feelings were

not utterly unpleasant, though she wanted them to be so.

In the first place, they were exciting. And in the second

place—what was it?—well, she had the strange, sweet

sensation of being, somehow, the mainspring of the universe,

of being immensely important in the scheme of things.
She thought her cup was full. It was not. Staring

blankly over the side of the ship she saw a buoy float

slowly by. She saw it with the utmost clearness, and on

its round black surface was painted in white letters the

word “Flank.” There could not be two Flank buoys. It

was the Flank buoy of the Mozewater navigable channel.

... She glanced around. The well-remembered shores of

Mozewater were plainly visible under the moon. In the

distance, over the bowsprit, she could discern the mass

of the tower of Mozewater church. She could not distinguish

Flank Hall, but she knew it was there. Why

were they threading the Mozewater channel? It had been

distinctly given out that the yacht would make Harwich

harbour. Almost unconsciously she turned in the direction

of the wheel, where Captain Wyatt was. Then, controlling

herself, she moved away. She knew that she could not

speak to the captain. She went below, and, before she

could escape, found the saloon populated.
“Oh! Mrs. Moncreiff!” cried Madame Piriac. “It is

a miraculous coincidence. You will never guess. One tells

me we are going to the village of Moze for the night;

it is because of the tide. You remember, I told you. It

is where lives my little friend, Audrey Moze. To-morrow

I visit her, and you must come with me. I insist that

you come with me. I have never seen her. It will be

all that is most palpitating.”

CHAPTER XXXIII
AGUILAR’S DOUBLE LIFE
Madame Piriac came down into the saloon the next

afternoon.
“Oh! You are still hiding yourself here!” she murmured

gaily to Audrey, who was alone among the cushions.
“I was just resting,” said Audrey. “Remember what

a night we had!”
It was true that the yacht had not been berthed at

Lousey Hard until between two and three o’clock in the

morning, and that no guest had slept until after the job

was done, though more than one had tried to sleep. It

was also true that in consequence the saloon breakfast

had been abrogated, that even the saloon lunch lacked

vicacity, and that at least one passenger was at that

moment dozing in his cabin. But not on account of fatigue

and somnolence was Audrey remaining in the saloon instead

of taking the splendid summer afternoon on deck under

the awning. She felt neither tired nor sleepy. The true

secret was that she feared the crowd of village idlers,

quidnuncs, tattlers and newsmongers who all day gazed

from Lousey Hard at the wonder-yacht.
Examining the line of faces as well as she could through

portholes, she recognised nearly every one of them, and

was quite sure that every one of them would recognise her

face. To go ashore or to stay prominently on deck would,

therefore, be to give away her identity and to be forced,

sooner or later, to admit that she had practised a long

and naughty deception. She could conceive some of those

villagers greeting her loudly from the Hard if she should

appear; for Essex manners were marked by strange freedoms.

Her situation would be terrible. It, in fact, was terrible.

Risks surrounded her like angry dogs. Musa, for example,

ought surely to have noticed that the estuary in which

the yacht lay was the same estuary which he had seen

not long before from the garden of the house stated by

Audrey to be her own, and he ought to have commented

eagerly on the marvellous coincidence. Happily, he had

not yet done so—no doubt because he had spent most of

the time in bed. If and when he did so there would naturally

be an excited outcry and a heavy rain of amazed questions

which simply could not be answered.
“I am going almost at once to call on my little friend

Audrey Moze, at Flank Hall,” said Madame Piriac. “The

house looks delicious from the deck. If you will come

up I will show it to you. It is precisely like the picture

post card which the dear little one sent to me last year.

Are you ready to come with me?”
“But, darling, hadn’t you better go alone?”
“But certainly not, darling! You are not serious.

The meeting will be very agitating. With a third person,

however, it will be less so. I count on you absolutely,

as I have said already. Nay, I insist. I invoke your

friendship.”
“She may be out. She may be away altogether.”
“In that case we shall return,” said Madame Piriac

briefly, and, not giving Audrey time to reply further, she

vanished, with a firm carriage and an obstinate look in

her eyes, towards the sleeping-cabins.
The next instant Mr. Gilman himself entered the saloon.
“Mrs. Moncreiff,” he started nervously, in a confidential

and deprecating tone, “this is the first chance I have had

to tell you. We came into Mozewater without my orders.

I won’t say against my orders, but certainly not with them.

On the plea that I had retired, Captain Wyatt changed

our destination last night without going through the formality

of consulting me. We ought to have made Harwich,

but I am now told that we were running short of paraffin,

and that if we had continued to Harwich we should have

had the worst of the tide against us, whereas in coming

up Mozewater the tide helped us; also that Captain Wyatt

did not care about trying to get into Harwich harbour at

night with the wind in its present quarter, and rising as

it was then. Of course, Wyatt is responsible for the

safety of the ship, and it is true that I had her designed

with a very light draught on purpose for such waters as

Mozewater; but he ought to have consulted me. We might

get away again on this tide, but Hortense will not hear

of it. She has a call to pay, she says. I can only tell you

how sorry I am. And I do hope you will forgive me.” The

sincerity and alarm of his manly apology were touching.
“But, Mr. Gilman,” said Audrey, with the simplicity

which more and more she employed in talking to her host,

“there is nothing to forgive. What can it matter to me

whether we come here or go to Harwich?”
“I thought, I was afraid—” Mr. Gilman hesitated.
“In short ... your secret, Mrs. Moncreiff, which you

asked me to keep, and which I have kept. It was here,

at this very spot, with my old barge-yacht, that I first

had the pleasure of meeting you. And I thought ...

perhaps you had reasons.... However, your secret is

safe.”
“How nice you are, Mr. Gilman!” Audrey said, with

a gentle smile. “You’re kindness itself. But there is

nothing to trouble about, really. Keep my little secret by

all means, if you don’t mind. As for anything else—that’s

perfectly all right.... Shall we go on deck?”
He thanked her without words.
She was saying to herself, rather desperately:
“After all, what do I care? I haven’t committed a

crime. It’s nobody’s business but my own. And I’m

worth ten million francs. And if the fat’s in the fire, and

anything is found out, and people don’t like it—well, they

must do the other thing.”
Thus she went on deck, and her courage was rewarded

by the discovery of a chair on the starboard side of the

deck-house, from which she could not possibly be seen by

any persons on the Hard. She took this chair like a gift

from heaven. The deck was busy enough. Mr. Price,

the secretary, was making entries in an account book.

Dr. Cromarty was pacing to and fro, expectant. Captain

Wyatt was arguing with the chauffeur of a vast motor-van

from Clacton, and another motor-van from Colchester was

also present on the Hard. Rows of paraffin cans were

ranged against the engine-room hatchway, and the odour

of paraffin was powerfully conflicting with the odour of

ozone and possibly ammonia from the marshes. Parcels

kept coming down by hand from the village of Moze. Fresh

water also came in barrels on a lorry, and lumps of ice

in a dog-cart. The arrival of six bottles of aspirin, brought

by a heated boy on a bicycle, from Clacton, and seized

with gusto by Dr. Cromarty, completed the proof that

money will not only buy anything, but will infallibly draw

it to any desired spot, however out of the way the spot

may be. The probability was that neither paraffin nor ice

nor aspirin had ever found itself on Lousey Hard before

in the annals of the world. Yet now these things forgathered

with ease and naturalness owing to the magic

of the word “yacht” in telegrams.
And over the scene floated the wavy, inspiring folds of

the yacht’s immense blue ensign, with the Union Jack in

the top inside corner.
Mr. Price went into the deck-house and began to count

money.
“Mr. Price,” demanded Mr. Gilman urgently, “did you

look up the facts about this village?”
“I was just looking up the place in ‘East Coast Tours,’

sir, when the paraffin arrived,” replied Mr. Price. “It says

that Moze is mentioned in ‘Green’s Short History of the

English People.’”
“Ah! Very interesting. That work is a classic. It

really treats of the English people, and not solely of their

kings and queens. Dr. Cromarty, Mr. Price is busy, will

you mind bringing me the catalogue of the library up here?”
Dr. Cromarty obeyed, and Mr. Gilman examined the

typewritten, calf-bound volume.
“Yes,” said he. “Yes. I thought we had Green on

board, and we have. I should like extremely to know what

Green says about Moze. It must have been in the Anglo-Saxon

or Norman period. Dr. Cromarty, will you mind

bringing me up the first three volumes of Green? You

will find them on shelf Z8. Also the last volume, for the

index.”
A few moments later Mr. Gilman, with three volumes of

Green on his knees and one in his hand, said reproachfully

to Mr. Price:
“Mr. Price, I requested you to see that the leaves of

all our books were cut. These volumes are absolutely

uncut.”
“Well, sir, I’m working through them as fast as I can.

But I haven’t got to shelf Z8 yet.”
“I cannot stop to cut them now,” said Mr. Gilman,

politely displeased. “What a pity! It would have been

highly instructive to know what Green says about Moze.

I always like to learn everything I can about the places we

stop at. And this place must be full of historic interest.

Wyatt, have you had that paraffin counted properly?” He

spoke very coldly to the captain.
It thus occurred that what John Richard Green

said about Moze was never known on board the yacht

Ariadne.
Audrey listened to the episode in a reverie. She was

thinking about Musa’s intractability and inexcusable rudeness,

and about what she should do in the matter of Madame

Piriac’s impending visit to Audrey Moze at Flank Hall, and

through the texture of these difficult topics she could see,

as it were, shining the sprightly simplicity, the utter ingenuousness,

the entirely reliable fidelity of Mr. Gilman.

She felt, rather than consciously realised, that he was a dull

man. But she liked his dullness; it reassured her; it was

tranquillising; it was even adorable. She liked also his

attitude towards Moze. She had never suspected, no one

had ever hinted to her, that Moze was full of historic interest.

But looking at it now from the yacht which had miraculously

wafted her past the Flank buoy at dead of night, she perceived

Moze in a quite new aspect—a pleasure which she

owed to Mr. Gilman’s artless interest in things. (Not that

he was artless in all affairs! No; in the great masculine

affairs he must be far from artless, for had he not made all

his money himself?)
Then Madame Piriac appeared on deck, armed and determined.

Audrey found, as hundreds of persons had found,

that it was impossible to deny Madame Piriac. Beautiful,

gracious, elegant, kind, when she would have a thing she

would have it. Audrey had to descend and prepare herself.

She had to reascend ready for the visit. But at the critical

and dreadful moment of going ashore to affront the crowd

she had a saving idea. She pointed to Flank Hall and its

sloping garden, and to the sea-wall against which the high

spring tide was already washing, and she suggested that

they should be rowed thither in the dinghy instead of

walking around by the sea-wall or through’ the village.
“But we cannot climb over that dyke,” Madame Piriac

protested.
“Oh, yes, we can,” said Audrey. “I can see steps in

it from here, and I can see a gate at the bottom of the

garden.”
“What a vision you have, darling!” murmured Madame

Piriac. “As you wish, provided we get there.”
The dinghy, at Audrey’s request, was brought round

to the side of the yacht opposite from the Hard, and,

screening her face as well as she could with an open

parasol, she tripped down by the steps into it. If only

Aguilar was away from the premises she might be saved,

for the place would be shut up, and there would be nothing

to do but return. Should Madame Piriac suggest going into

the village to inquire—well, Audrey would positively refuse

to go into the village. Yes, she would refuse!
As the boat moved away from the yacht, Musa showed

himself on deck. Madame Piriac signalled to him a salutation

of the finest good humour. She had forgotten his

pettishness. By absolutely ignoring it she had made it as

though it had never existed. This was her art. Audrey,

observing the gesture, and Musa’s smiling reply to it,

acquired wisdom. She saw that she must treat Musa as

Madame Piriac treated him. She had undertaken the enterprise

of launching him on a tremendous artistic career, and

she must carry it through. She wanted to make a neat,

clean job of the launching, and she would do it dispassionately,

like a good workwoman. He had admitted—nay, he

had insisted—that she was necessary to him. Her pride in

that fact had a somewhat superior air. He might be the

most marvellous of violinists, but he was also a child, helpless

without her moral support. She would act accordingly.

It was absurd to be angry with a child, no matter what his

vagaries.... At this juncture of her reflections she noticed

that Mr. Gilman and Miss Thompkins had quitted the yacht

together and were walking seawards. They seemed very

intimate, impregnated with mutual understanding. And

Audrey was sorry that Mr. Gilman was quite so simple,

quite so straightforward and honest.
When the dinghy arrived at the sea-wall Audrey won

the stalled admiration of the sailor in charge of the boat by

pointing at once to the best—if not the only—place fit for a

landing. The sailor was by no means accustomed to such

flair in a yacht’s guests. Indeed, it had often astonished him

that people who, as a class, had so little notion of how to

get into or out of a dinghy could have succeeded, as they

all apparently had, in any department of life.
With continuing skill, Audrey guided Madame Piriac

over the dyke and past sundry other obstacles, including a

watercourse, to a gate in the wall which formed the frontier

of the grounds of Flank Hall. The gate seemed at first to

be unopenably fastened, but Audrey showed that she

possessed a genius with gates, and opened it with a twist

of the hand. They wandered through a plantation and then

through an orchard, and at length saw the house. There

was not a sign of Aguilar, but the unseen yard-dog began

to bark, hearing which, Madame Piriac observed in French:

“The property seems a little neglected, but there must

be someone at home.”
“Aguilar is bound to come now!” thought Audrey.

“And I am lost!” Then she added to herself: “And I

don’t care if I am lost. What an unheard-of lark!”

And to Madame Piriac she said lightly:

“Well, we must explore.”
The blinds were nearly all up on the garden front. And

one window—the French window of the drawing-room—was

wide open.
“The crisis will be here in one minute at the latest,”

thought Audrey.
“Evidently Miss Moze is at home,” said Madame Piriac,

gazing at the house. “Yes, it is distinguished. It is what

I had expected.... But ought we not to go to the front

door?”
“I think we ought,” Audrey agreed.
They went round the side of the house, into the main

drive, and without hesitation Madame Piriac rang the front

door bell, which they could plainly hear. “I must have my

cards ready,” said she, opening her bag. “One always

hears how exigent you are in England about such details,

even in the provinces. And, indeed, why not?”
There was no answer to the bell. Madame Piriac rang

again, and there was still no answer. And the dog had

ceased to bark.
“Mon Dieu!“ she muttered. “Have you observed,

darling, that all the blinds are down on this façade?”
She rang a third time. Then, without a word, they

returned slowly to the garden front.
“How mysterious! Mon Dieu! How English it all

is!” muttered Madame Piriac. “It gives me fear.”
Audrey had almost decided definitely that she was saved

when she happened to glance through the open window of

the drawing-room. She thought she saw a flicker within.

She looked again. She could not be mistaken. Then she

noticed that all the dust sheets had been removed from the

furniture, that the carpet had been laid, that a table had

been set for tea, that there were flowers and china and a

teapot and bread-and-butter and a kettle and a spirit-lamp

on the table. The flicker was the flicker of the blue flame

of the spirit-lamp. The kettle over it was puffing out steam.
Audrey exclaimed, within herself:
“Aguilar!”
She had caught him at last. There were two cups and

saucers—the best ancient blue-and-white china, out of the

glass-fronted china cupboard in that very room! The

celibate Aguilar, never known to consort with anybody at

all, was clearly about to entertain someone to tea, and the

aspect of things showed that he meant to do it very well.

True, there was no cake, but the bread-and-butter was

expertly cut and attractively arranged. Audrey felt sure

that she was on the track of Aguilar’s double life, and that

a woman was concerned therein. She was angry, but she

was also enormously amused and uplifted. She no longer

cared the least bit about the imminent danger threatening

her incognito. Her sole desire was to entrap Aguilar, and

with deep joy she pictured his face when he should come into

the room with his friend and find the mistress of the house

already installed.
“I think we had better go in here, darling,” she said to

Madame Piriac, with her hand on the French window.

“There is no other entrance.”
Madame Piriac looked at her.
“Eh bien! It is your country, not mine. You know

the habits. I follow you,” said Madame Piriac calmly.

“After all, my dear little Audrey ought to be delighted to

see me. I have several times told her that I should come.

All the same, I expected to announce myself.... What a

charming room! So this is the English provinces!”
The room was certainly agreeable to the eye. And

Audrey seemed to see it afresh, to see it for the first time

in her life. And she thought: “Can this be the shabby old

drawing-room that I hated so?”
The kettle continued to puff vigorously.
“If they don’t come soon,” said Audrey, “the water will

be all boiled away and the kettle burnt. Suppose we make

the tea?”
Madame Piriac raised her eyebrows.
“It is your country,” she repeated. “That appears to

be singular, but I have not the English habits.”
And she sat down, smiling.
Audrey opened the tea caddy, put three spoonfuls of tea

into the pot, and made the tea.
The clock struck on the mantelpiece. The clock was

actually going. Aguilar was ever thorough in his actions.
“Four minutes to brew, and if they don’t come we’ll

have tea,” said Audrey, tranquil in the assurance that the

advent of Aguilar could not now be long delayed.
“Do you take milk and sugar, darling?” she asked

Madame Piriac at the end of the four minutes, which they

had spent mainly in a curious silence. “I believe you do.”
Madame Piriac nodded.
“A little bread-and-butter? I’m sorry there’s no cake

or jam.”
It was while Madame Piriac was stirring her first cup

that the drawing-room door opened, and at once there was

a terrific shriek.
“Audrey!”
The invader was Miss Ingate. Close behind Miss Ingate

came Jane Foley.

CHAPTER XXXIV
THE TANK-ROOM
”Did you get my letter?” breathed Miss Ingate weakly,

after she had a little recovered from the shock, which had

the appearance of being terrific.
“No,” said Audrey. “How could I? We’re yachting.

Madame Piriac, you know Miss Ingate, don’t you? And

this is my friend Jane Foley.” She spoke quite easily and

naturally, though Miss Ingate in her intense agitation had

addressed her as Audrey, whereas the Christian name of

Mrs. Moncreiff, on the rare occasions when a Christian name

became necessary or advisable, had been Olivia—or, infrequently,

Olive.
“Yachting!”
“Yes. Haven’t you seen the yacht at the Hard?”
“No! I did hear something about it, but I’ve been too

busy to run after yachts. We’ve been too busy, haven’t we,

Miss Foley? I even have to keep my dog locked up. I

don’t know what you’ll say. Aud—Mrs. Moncreiff! I

really don’t! But we acted for the best. Oh! How

dreadfully exciting my life does get at times! Never since

I played the barrel organ all the way down Regent Street

have I—! Oh! dear!”
“Have my tea, and do sit down, Winnie, and remember

you’re an Essex woman!” Audrey adjured her, going to

the china cupboard to get more cups.
“I’ll just tell you all about it, Mrs. Moncreiff, if you’ll

let me,” Jane Foley began with a serene and happy smile,

as she limped to a chair. “I’m quite ready to take all the

consequences. It’s the police again, that’s all. I don’t

know how exactly they got on the track of the Spatts at

Frinton. But I dare say you’ve seen that the police have

seized a lot of documents at our head-quarters. Perhaps

that explains it. Anyway I caught sight of our old friend

at Paget Gardens nosing about, and so as soon as it was

dark I left the Spatts. It’s a horrid thing to say, but I

never was so glad about anything as I was at leaving the

Spatts. I didn’t tell them where I was going, and they

didn’t ask. I’m sure the poor things were very relieved to

have me go. Miss Ingate tells me to-day she’s heard they’ve

both resigned from the Union. Mr. Spatt went up to

London on purpose to do it. And can you be surprised?”
“Yes, you can, and yet you can’t!” exclaimed Miss

Ingate. “You can, and yet you can’t!”
“I met Miss Ingate on Frinton front,” Jane Foley proceeded.

“She was just getting into her carriage. I had

my bag and I asked her to drive me to the station. ‘To the

station?’ she said. ‘What for? There’s no train to-night.’”
“No more there wasn’t!” Miss Ingate put in, “I’d been

dining at the Proctors’ and it was after ten, I know it was

after ten because they never let me leave until after ten, in

spite of the long drive I have. Fancy there being a train

from Frinton after ten! So of course I brought Miss Foley

along. Oh! It was vehy interesting. Vehy interesting.

You see we had to think of the police. I didn’t want the

police coming poking round my house. It would never do,

in a little place like Moze. I should never hear the last of

it. So I—I thought of Flank Hall. I——”
Jane Foley went on:
“Miss Ingate was sure you wouldn’t mind, Mrs. Moncreiff.

And personally I was quite certain you wouldn’t

mind. We left the carriage at Miss Ingate’s, and carried

the bag in turns. And I stood outside while Miss Ingate

woke up Mr. Aguilar. It was soon all right.”
“I must say Aguilar was vehy reasonable,” said Miss

Ingate. “Vehy reasonable. And he’s got a great spite

against my dear Inspector Keeble. He suggested everything.

He never asked any questions, so I told him. You

do, you know. He suggested Miss Foley should have a

bed in the tank-room, so that if there was any trouble all

the bedrooms should look innocent.”
“Did he tell you I’d come here to see him not long

since?” Audrey demanded.
“And why didn’t you pop in to see me? I was hurt

when I got your note.”
“Did he tell you?”
“Of course he didn’t. He never tells anybody anything.

That sort of thing’s very useful at times, especially when

it’s combined with a total lack of curiosity. He fixed every,

thing up. And he keeps the gates locked, so that people

can’t wander in.”
“He didn’t lock the gate at the bottom of the garden,

because it won’t lock,” said Audrey. “And so he didn’t

keep me from wandering in.” She felt rather disappointed

that Aguilar should once more have escaped her reproof and

that the dream of his double life should have vanished away,

but she was determined to prove that he was not perfect.
“Well, I don’t know about that,” said Miss Ingate.

“It wouldn’t startle me to hear that he knew you were intending

to come. All I know is that Miss Foley’s been

here for several days. Not a soul knows except me and

Aguilar. And it seems to get safer every day. She does

venture about the house now, though she never goes into

the garden while it’s light. It was Aguilar had the idea

of putting this room straight for her.”
“And it was he who cut the bread-and-butter,” added

Jane Foley.
“And this was to be our first tea-party!” Miss Ingate

half shrieked. “I’d come—I do come, you know, to keep

an eye on things as you asked me—I’d come, and we were

just having a cosy little chat in the tank-room. Aguilar’s

gone to Colchester to get a duplicate key of the front gates.

He left me his, so I could get in and lock up after myself,

and he put the water on to boil before leaving. I said to

Miss Foley, I said, up in the tank-room: ‘Was that a ring

at the door?’ But she said it wasn’t.”
“I’ve been a little deaf since I was in prison,” said

Jane Foley.
“And now we come down and find you here! I—I hope

I’ve done right.” This, falteringly, from Miss Ingate.
“Of course you have, you silly old thing,” Audrey

reassured her. “It’s splendid!”
“Whenever I think of the police I laugh,” said Miss

Ingate in an unsettled voice. “I can’t help it. They can’t

possibly suspect. And they’re looking everywhere, everywhere!

I can’t help laughing.” And suddenly she burst

into tears.
“Oh! Now! Winnie, dear. Don’t spoil it all!”

Audrey protested, jumping up.
Madame Piriac, who had hitherto maintained the most

complete passivity, restrained her.
“Leave her tranquil!” murmured Madame Piriac in

French. “She is not spoiling it. On the contrary! One is

content to see that she is a woman!”
And then Miss Ingate laughed, and blushed, and called

herself names.
“And so you haven’t had my letter,” said she. “I wish

you had had it. But what is this yachting business? I

never heard of such goings-on. Is it your yacht? This

world is getting a bit too wonderful for me.”
The answer to these questions was cut short by rather

heavy masculine footsteps approaching the door of the

drawing-room. Miss Ingate grew instantly serious. Audrey

and Jane looked at each other, and Jane Foley went quickly

but calmly to the door and opened it.
“Oh! It’s Mr. Aguilar—returned!” she said, quietly.

“Is anything the matter, Mr. Aguilar?”
Aguilar, hat in hand, entered the room.
“Good afternoon, Aguilar,” Audrey greeted him.
“’Noon, madam,” he responded, exactly as though he

had been expecting to find the mistress there. “It’s like

this. I’ve just seen Inspector Keeble and that there detective

as was here afore—you know, madam” (nodding to

Audrey) “and I fancy they’re a-coming this way, so I

thought I’d better cut back and warn ye. I don’t think they

saw me. I was too quick for ’em. Was the bread-and-butter

all right, Miss Ingate? Thank ye.”
Miss Ingate had risen.
“I ought to go home,” she said. “I feel sure it would

be wiser for me to go home. I never could talk to

detectives.”
Jane Foley snatched at one of the four cups and saucers

on the table, and put it back, all unwashed, into the china

cupboard.
“Three cups will be enough for them to see, if they

come,” she said, with a bright, happy smile to Audrey.

“Yes, Miss Ingate, you go home. I’m ever so much

obliged to you. Now, I’ll go upstairs and Aguilar shall

lock me in the tank-room and push the key under the door.

We are causing you a lot of trouble, Mrs. Moncreiff, but

you won’t mind. It might have been so much worse.” She

laughed as she went.
“And suppose I meet those police on the way out, what

am I to say to them?” asked Miss Ingate when Jane Foley

and Aguilar had departed.
“If they’re very curious, tell them you’ve been here to

have tea with me and that Aguilar cut the bread-and-butter,”

Audrey replied. “The detective will be interested to see me.

He chased me all the way to London not long since. Au

revoir, Winnie.”
“Dear friend,” said Madame Piriac, with admirable

though false calm. “Would it not be more prudent to

fly back at once to the yacht—if in truth this is the same

police agent of whom you recounted to me with such

drollness the exploits? It is not that I am afraid——”
“Nor I,” said Audrey. “There is no danger except to

Jane Foley.”
“Ah! You cannot abandon her. That is true. Nevertheless

I regret ...”
“Well, darling,” Audrey exclaimed. “You would insist

on my coming!”
The continuing presence of Miss Ingate, who had lost one

glove and her purse, rendered this brief conversation somewhat

artificial. And no sooner had Miss Ingate got away—by

the window, for the sake of dispatch—than a bell made

itself heard, and Aguilar came back to the drawing-room in

the rôle of butler.
“Inspector Keeble and a gentleman to see you, madam.”
“Bring them in,” said Audrey.
Aguilar’s secret glance at Inspector Keeble as he brought

in the visitors showed that his lifelong and harmless enemy

had very little to hope from his goodwill.
“Wait a moment, you!” called the detective as Aguilar,

like a perfect butler, was vanishing. “Good afternoon,

ladies. Excuse me, I wish to question this man.” He

indicated Aguilar with a gesture of apologising for Aguilar.
Inspector Keeble, an overgrown mass of rectitude and

kindliness, greeted Audrey with that constraint which

always afflicted him when he was beneath any roof more

splendid than that of his own police-station.
“Now, Aguilar,” said the detective, “it’s you that’ll be

telling me. Ye’ve got a woman concealed in the house.

Where is she?”
He knew, then, this ferreting and divinatory Irishman!

Of course Miss Ingate must have committed some indiscretion,

or was it that Aguilar was less astute than he

gave the impression of being? Audrey considered that all

was lost, and she was aware of a most unpleasant feeling

of helplessness and inefficiency. Then she seemed to receive

inspiration and optimism from somewhere. She knew not

exactly from where, but perhaps it was from the shy stiffness

of the demeanour of her old acquaintance, Inspector Keeble.

Moreover, the Irishman’s twinkling eyes were a challenge

to her.
“Oh! Aguilar!” she exclaimed. “I’m very sorry to

hear this. I knew women were always your danger, but

I never dreamt you would start carrying on in my

absence.”
Aguilar fronted her, and their eyes met. Audrey gazed

at him steadily. There was no smile in Audrey’s eyes,

but there was a smile glimmering mysteriously behind

them, and after a couple of seconds this phenomenon

aroused a similar phenomenon behind the eyes of Aguilar.

Audrey had the terrible and god-like sensation of lifting

a hired servant to equality with herself. She imagined

that she would never again be able to treat him as Aguilar,

and she even feared that she would soon begin to cease

to hate him. At the same time she observed slight signs

of incertitude in the demeanour of the detective.
Aguilar replied coldly, not to Audrey, but to the

police:
“If Inspector Keeble or anybody else has been mixing

my name up with any scandal about females, I’ll have

him up for slander and libel and damages as sure as I

stand here.”
Inspector Keeble looked away, and then looked at the

detective—as if for support in peril.
“Do you mean to say, Aguilar, that you haven’t got

a woman hidden in the house at this very moment?” the

detective demanded.
“I’ll thank ye to keep a civil tongue in your head,”

said Aguilar. “Or I’ll take ye outside and knock yer face

sideways. Pardon me, madam. Of course I ain’t got no

woman concealed on the premises. And mark ye, if I

lose my place through this ye’ll hear of it. And I shall

put a letter in the Gardeners’ Chronicle, too.”
“Well, ye can go,” the detective responded.
“Yes,” sneered Aguilar. “I can go. Yes, and I shall

go. But not so far but what I can protect my interests.

And I’ll make this village too hot for Keeble before I’ve

done, police or no police.”
And with a look at Audrey like the look of a knight

at his lady after a joust, Aguilar turned to leave the

room.
“Aguilar,” Audrey rewarded him. “You needn’t be

afraid about your place.”
“Thank ye, m’m.”
“May I ask what your name is?” Audrey inquired of

the detective as soon as Aguilar had shut the door.
“Hurley,” replied the detective.
“I thought it might be,” said Audrey, sitting down,

but not offering seats. “Well, Mr. Hurley, after all your

running after Miss Susan Foley, don’t you think it’s rather

unfair to say horrid things about a respectable man like

Aguilar? You were funny about that stout wife of

yours last time I saw you, but you must remember that

Aguilar can’t be funny about his wife, because he hasn’t

got one.”
“I really don’t know what you’re driving at, miss,”

said Mr. Hurley simply.
“Well, what were you driving at when you followed

me all the way to London the other day?”
“Madam,” said Mr. Hurley, “I didn’t follow you to

London. I only happened to arrive at Charing Cross about

twenty seconds after you, that was all. As a matter of

fact, nearly half of the way you were following me.”
“Well, I hope you were satisfied.”
“I only want to know one thing,” the detective retorted.

“Am I speaking to Mrs. Olivia Moncreiff?”
Audrey hesitated, glancing at Madame Piriac, who, in

company with the vast Inspector Keeble, was carefully

inspecting the floor. She invoked wisdom and sagacity

from heaven, and came to a decision.
“Not that I know of,” she answered.
“Then, if you please, who are you?”
“What!” exclaimed Audrey. “You’re in the village

of Moze itself and you ask who I am. Everybody knows

me. My name is Audrey Moze, of Flank Hall, Moze,

Essex. Any child in Moze Street will tell you that. Inspector

Keeble knows as well as anybody.”
Madame Piriac proceeded steadily with the inquiry into

the carpet. Audrey felt her heart beating.
“Unmarried?” pursued the detective.
“Most decidedly,” said Audrey with conviction.
“Then what’s the meaning of that ring on your finger,

if you don’t mind my asking?” the detective continued.
Certainly Audrey was flustered, but only for a moment.
“Mr. Hurley,” said she; “I wear it as a protection

from men of all ages who are too enterprising.”
She spoke archly, with humour; but now there was no

answering humour in the features of Mr. Hurley, who

seemed to be a changed man, to be indeed no longer even

an Irishman. And Audrey grew afraid. Did he, after all,

know of her share in the Blue City enterprise? She had

long since persuaded herself that the police had absolutely

failed to connect her with that affair, but now uncertainty

was born in her mind.
“I must search the house,” said the detective.
“What for?”
“I have to arrest a woman named Jane Foley,” answered

Mr. Hurley, adding somewhat grimly: “The name will be

known to ye, I’m thinking.... And I have reason to

believe that she is now concealed on these premises.”
The directness of the blow was terrific. It was almost

worse than the blow itself. And Audrey now believed

everything that she had ever heard or read about the

miraculous ingenuity of detectives. Still, she did not

regard herself as beaten, and the thought of the yacht

lying close by gave her a dim feeling of security. If she

could only procure delay!...
“I’m not going to let you search my house,” she said

angrily. “I never heard of such a thing! You’ve got

no right to search my house.”
“Oh yes, I have!” Mr. Hurley insisted.
“Well, let me see your paper—I don’t know what you

call it. But I know you can’t do anything-without a

paper. Otherwise any bright young-man might walk into

my house and tell me he meant to search it. Keeble, I’m

really surprised at you.”
Inspector Keeble blushed.
“I’m very sorry, miss,” said he contritely. “But the

law’s the law. Show the lady your search-warrant, Mr.

Hurley.” His voice resembled himself.
Mr. Hurley coughed. “I haven’t got a search-warrant

yet,” he remarked. “I didn’t expect——”
“You’d better go and get one, then,” said Audrey,

calculating how long it would take three women to transport

themselves from the house to the yacht, and perpending

upon the probable behaviour of Mr. Gilman under a given

set of circumstances.
“I will,” said Mr. Hurley. “And I shan’t be long.

Keeble, where is the nearest justice of the peace?...

You’d better stay here or hereabouts.”
“I got to go to the station to sign on my three constables,”

Inspector Keeble protested awkwardly, looking

at his watch, which also resembled himself.
“You’d better stay here or hereabouts,” repeated Mr.

Hurley, and he moved towards the door. Inspector Keeble,

too, moved towards the door.
Audrey let them get into the passage, and then she

was vouchsafed a new access of inspiration.
“Mr. Hurley,” she called, in a bright, unoffended tone.

“After all, I see no reason why you shouldn’t search the

house. I don’t really want to put you to any unnecessary

trouble. It is annoying, but I’m not going to be annoyed.”

The ingenuous young creature expected Mr. Hurley to be

at once disarmed and ashamed by this kind offer. She

was wrong. He was evidently surprised, but he gave no

evidence of shame or of the sudden death in his brain of

all suspicions.
“That’s better,” he said calmly. “And I’m much

obliged.”
“I’ll come with you,” said Audrey. “Madame Piriac,”

she addressed Hortense with averted eyes. “Will you

excuse me for a minute or two while I show these gentlemen

the house?” The fact was that she did not care just

then to be left alone with Madame Piriac.
“Oh! I beg you, darling! “Madame Piriac granted

the permission with overpowering sweetness.
The procedure of Mr. Hurley was astonishing to Audrey;

nay, it was unnerving. First he locked the front door

and the garden door and pocketed the keys. Then he

locked the drawing-room on the passage side and pocketed

that key. He instructed Inspector Keeble to remain in

the hall at the foot of the stairs. He next went into the

kitchen and the sculleries and locked the outer doors in

that quarter. Then he descended to the cellars, with Audrey

always in his wake. Having searched the cellars and the

ground floor, he went upstairs, and examined in turn all

the bedrooms with a thoroughness and particularity which

caused Audrey to blush. He left nothing whatever to

chance, and no dust sheet was undisturbed. Audrey said

no word. The detective said no word. But Audrey kept

thinking: “He is getting nearer to the tank-room.” A

small staircase led to the attic floor, upon which were only

servants’ bedrooms and the tank-room. After he had

mounted this staircase and gone a little way along the

passage he swiftly and without warning dashed back and

down the staircase. But nothing seemed to happen, and

he returned. The three doors of the three servants’

bedrooms were all ajar. Mr. Hurley passed each of them

with a careless glance within. At the end of the corridor,

in obscurity, was the door of the tank-room.
“What’s this?” he asked abruptly. And he knocked

nonchalantly on the door of the tank-room.
Audrey was acutely alarmed lest Jane Foley should

respond, thinking the knock was that of a friend. She

saw how idiotic she had been not to warn Jane by means

of loud conversation with the detective.
“That’s the tank-room,” she said loudly. “I’m afraid

it’s locked.”
“Oh!” murmured Mr. Hurley negligently, and he turned

the searchlight of his gaze upon the three bedrooms, which

he examined as carefully as he had examined anything in

the house. The failure to discover in any cupboard or

corner even the shadow of a human being did not appear

to discourage him in the slightest degree. In the third

bedroom—that is to say, the one nearest the head of

the stairs and farthest from the tank-room—he suddenly

beckoned to Audrey, who was standing in the doorway.

She went within the room and he pushed the door to,

without, however, quite shutting it.
“Now about the tank-room, Miss Moze,” he began

quietly. “You say it’s locked?”
“Yes,” said the quaking Audrey.
“As a matter of form I’d better just look in. Will

you kindly let me have the key?”
“I can’t,” said Audrey.
“Why not?”
Audrey acquired tranquillity as she went on: “It’s at

Frinton. Friends of mine there keep a punt on Mozewater,

and I let them store the sail and things in

the tank-room. There’s plenty of room. I give them

the key because that’s more satisfactory. The tank-room

isn’t wanted at all, you see, while I’m away from

home.”
“Who are these friends?”
“Mr. and Mrs. Spatt,” said Audrey at a venture.
“I see,” said the detective.
They came downstairs, and the detective made it known

that he would re-visit the drawing-room. Inspector Keeble

followed them. In that room Audrey remarked:
“And now I hope you’re satisfied.”
Mr. Hurley merely said:
“Will you please ring for Aguilar?”
Audrey complied. But she had to ring three times before

the gardener’s footsteps were heard on the uncarpeted stone

floor of the hall.
“Aguilar,” Mr. Hurley demanded. “Where is the key

of the tank-room?”
Audrey sank into a chair, knowing profoundly that

all was lost.
“It’s at Mrs. Spatt’s at Frinton,” replied Aguilar glibly.

“Mistress lets her have that room to store some boat-gear

in. I expected she’d ha’ been over before this to get it

out. But the yachting season seems to start later and

later every year these times.”
Audrey gazed at the man as at a miracle-worker.
“Well, I think that’s all,” said Mr. Hurley.
“No, it isn’t,” Audrey corrected him. “You’ve got all

my keys in your pocket—except one.”
When the police had gone Audrey said to Aguilar in

the hall:
“Aguilar, how on earth did you——”
But she was in such a state of emotion at the realisation

of dangers affronted and past that she could not finish.
“I’m sorry I was so long answering the bell, m’m,”

replied Aguilar strangely. “But I’d put my list slippers

on—them as your father made me wear when I come into

the house, mornings, to change the plants, and I thought

it better to put my boots on again before I come....

Shall I put the keys back in the doors, madam?”
So saying he touched his front hair, after his manner,

and took the keys and retired. Audrey was as full of

fear as of gratitude. Aguilar daunted her.

CHAPTER XXXV
THE THIRD SORT OF WOMAN
“It was quite true what I told the detective. So I

suppose you’ve finished with me for evermore!” Audrey

burst out recklessly, as soon as she and Madame Piriac

were alone together. The supreme moment had come, and

she tried to grasp it like a nettle. Her adventurous

rashness was, she admitted, undeniable. She had spoken

the truth to the police officer about her identity and her

spinsterhood because with unusual wisdom she judged that

fibs or even prevarication on such a subject to such an

audience might entangle her in far more serious difficulties

later on. Moreover, with Inspector Keeble present, she

could not successfully have gone very far from the truth.

It was a pity that Madame Piriac had witnessed the scene,

for really, when Audrey came to face it, the deception

which she had practised upon Madame Piriac was of a

monstrous and inexcusable kind. And now that Madame

Piriac knew the facts, many other people would have

to know the facts—including probably Mr. Gilman. The

prospect of explanations was terrible. In vain Audrey

said to herself that the thing was naught, that she had

acted within her rights, and that anyhow she had long

ago ceased to be diffident and shy!... She was intimidated

by her own enormities. And she also thought: “How

could I have been silly enough to tell that silly tale about

the Spatts? More complications. And poor dear Inspector

Keeble will be so shocked.”
After a short pause Madame Piriac replied, in a grave

but kind tone:
“Why would you that I should have finished with you

for ever? You had the right to call yourself by any name

you wished, and to wear any ring-that pleased your caprice.

It is the affair of nobody but yourself.”
“Oh! I’m so glad you take it like that,” said Audrey

with eager relief. “That’s just what I thought all along!”
“But it is your affair!” Madame Piriac finished, with

a peculiar inflection of her well-controlled voice. “I mean,”

she added, “you cannot afford to neglect it.”
“No—of course not,” Audrey agreed, rather dashed, and

with a vague new apprehension. “Naturally I shall tell you

everything, darling. I had my reasons. I——”
“The principal question is, darling,” Madame Piriac

stopped her. “What are you going to do now? Ought we

not to return to the yacht?”
“But I must look after Jane Foley!” cried Audrey. “I

can’t leave her here.”
“And why not? She has Miss Ingate.”
“Yes, worse luck for her! Winnie would make the most

dreadful mess of things if she wasn’t stopped. If Winnie

was right out of it, and Jane Foley had only herself and

Aguilar to count on, there might be a chance. But not else.”
“It is by pure hazard that you are here. Nobody expected

you. What would this young girl Mees Foley have

done if you had not been here?”
“It’s no good wasting time about that, darling, because

I am here, don’t you see?” Audrey straightened her

shoulders and put her hands behind her back.
“My little one,” said Madame Piriac with a certain

solemnity. “You remember our conversation in my boudoir.

I then told you that you would find yourself in a riot within

a month, if you continued your course. Was I right?

Happily you have escaped from that horrible complication.

Go no farther. Listen to me. You were not created for

these adventures. It is impossible that you should be

happy in them.”
“But look at Jane Foley,” said Audrey eagerly. “Is she

not happy? Did you ever see anybody as happy as Jane?

I never did.”
“That is not happiness,” replied Madame Piriac. “That

is exaltation. It is morbid. I do not say that it is not right

for her. I do not say that she is not justified, and that that

which she represents is not justified. But I say that a rôle

such as hers is not your rôle. To commence, she does not

interest herself in men. For her there are no men in the

world—there are only political enemies. Do you think I

do not know the type? We have it, chez nous. It is full of

admirable qualities—but it is not your type. For you,

darling, the world is inhabited principally by men, and the

time will come—perhaps soon—when for you it will be inhabited

principally by one man. If you remain obdurate,

there must inevitably arrive a quarrel between that man and

these—these riotous adventures.”
“No man that I could possibly care for,” Audrey retorted,

“would ever object to me having an active interest

in—er—politics.”
“I agree, darling,” said Madame Piriac. “He would

not object. It is you who would object. The quarrel would

occur within your own heart. There are two sorts of women—individualists

and fanatics. It was always so. I am a

woman, and I know what I’m saying. So do you. Well,

you belong to the first sort of woman.”
“I don’t,” Audrey protested. Nevertheless she recollected

her thoughts on the previous night, near the

binnacle and Mr. Gilman, about the indispensability of a

man and about the futility of the state of not owning and

possessing a man. The memory of these thoughts only

rendered her more obstinate.
“But you will not have the courage to tell me that you

are a fanatic?”
“No.”
“Then what?”
“There is a third sort of woman.”
“Darling, believe me, there is not.”
“There’s going to be, anyhow!” said Audrey with

decision, and in English. “And I won’t leave Jane

Foley in the lurch, either!... Now I’ll just run up

and have a talk with her, if you don’t mind waiting a

minute or two.”
“But what are you going to do?” Madame Piriac

demanded.
“Well,” said Audrey. “It is obvious that there is only

one safe thing to do. I shall take Jane on board the yacht.

We shall sail off, and she’ll be safe.”
“On the yacht!” repeated Madame Piriac, truly

astounded. “But my poor oncle will never agree. You do

not know him. You do not know how peculiar he is. Never

will he agree! Besides——”
“Darling,” said Audrey quietly and confidently. “If he

does not agree, I undertake to go into a convent for the rest

of my days.”
Madame Piriac was silent.
Just as she was opening the door to go upstairs, Audrey

suddenly turned back into the room.
“Darling,” she said, kissing Madame Piriac. “How

calmly you’ve taken it!”
“Taken what?”
“About me not being Mrs. Moncreiff nor a widow nor

anything of that kind.”
“But, darling,” answered Madame Piriac with exquisite

tranquillity. “Of course I knew it before.”
“You knew it before!”
“Certainly. I knew it the first time I saw you, in the

studio of Mademoiselle Nickall. You were the image of

your father! The image, I repeat—except perhaps the nose.

Recollect that as a child I saw your father. I was left with

my mother’s relatives, until matters should be arranged;

but he came to Paris. Then before matters could be

arranged my mother died, and I never saw him again. But

I could never forget him.... Then also, in my boudoir that

night, you blushed—it was very amusing—when I mentioned

Essex and Audrey Moze. And there were other

things.”
“For instance?”
“Darling, you were never quite convincing as a widow—at

any rate to a Frenchwoman. You may have deceived

American and English women. But not myself. You did

not say the convincing things when the conversation took

certain turns. That is all.”
“You knew who I was, and you never told me!”

Audrey pouted.
“Had I the right, darling? You had decided upon your

identity. It would have been inexcusable on my part to

inform you that you were mistaken in so essential a detail.”
Madame Piriac gently returned Audrey’s kiss.
“So that was why you insisted on me coming with you

to-day!” murmured Audrey, crestfallen. “You are a

marvellous actress, darling.”
“I have several times been told so,” Madame Piriac

admitted simply.
“What on earth did you expect would happen?”
“Not that which has happened,” said Madame Piriac.
“Well, if you ask me,” said Audrey with gaiety and a

renewal of self-confidence.” I think it’s all happened

splendidly.”

CHAPTER XXXVI
IN THE DINGHY
When the pair got back to the sea-wall the tide had considerably

ebbed, and where the dinghy had floated there

was nothing more liquid than exquisitely coloured mud.

Nevertheless water still lapped the yacht, whereas on the

shore side of the yacht was now no crowd. The vans and

carts had all departed, and the quidnuncs and observers of

human nature, having gazed steadily at the yacht for some

ten hours, had thought fit to depart also. The two women

looked about rather anxiously, as though Mr. Gilman had

basely marooned them.
“But what must we do?” demanded Madame Piriac.
“Oh! We can walk round on the dyke,” said Audrey

superiorly. “Unless the stiles frighten you.”
“It is about to rain,” said Madame Piriac, glancing at

the high curved heels of her shoes.
The sky, which was very wide and variegated over

Mozewater, did indeed seem to threaten.
At that moment the dinghy appeared round the forefoot

of the Ariadne. Mr. Gilman and Miss Thompkins were in

it, and Mr. Gilman was rowing with gentleness and dignity.

They had, even afar off, a tremendous air of intimacy; each

leaned towards the other, face to face, and Tommy had

her chin in her hands and her elbows on her knees. And

in addition to an air of intimacy they had an air of mystery.

It was surprising, and perhaps a little annoying, to Audrey

that those two should have gone on living to themselves, in

their own self-absorbed way, while such singular events had

been happening to herself in Flank Hall. She put several

fingers in her mouth and produced a piercing long-distance

whistle which effectively reached the dinghy.
“My poor little one!” exclaimed Madame Piriac,

shocked in spite of her broadmindedness by both the sound

and the manner of its production.
“Oh! I learnt that when I was twelve,” said Audrey.

“It took me four months, but I did it. And nobody except

Miss Ingate knows that I can do it.”
The occupants of the dinghy were signalling their

intention to rescue, and Mr. Gilman used his back nobly.
“But we cannot embark here!” Madame Piriac complained.
“Oh, yes!” said Audrey. “You see those white stones? ...

It’s quite easy.”
When the dinghy had done about half the journey

Madame Piriac murmured:
“By the way, who are you, precisely, for the present?

It would be prudent to decide, darling.”
Audrey hesitated an instant.
“Who am I? ... Oh! I see. Well, I’d better keep

on being Mrs. Moncreiff for a bit, hadn’t I?”
“It is as you please, darling.”
The fact was that Audrey recoiled from a general confession,

though admitting it to be ultimately inevitable.

Moreover, she had a slight fear that each of her friends in

turn might make a confession ridiculous by saying: “We

knew all along, of course.”
The dinghy was close in.
“My!” cried Tommy. “Who did that whistle? It was

enough to beat the cars.”
“Wouldn’t you like to know!” Audrey retorted.
The embarkation, under Audrey’s direction, was accomplished

in safety, and, save for one tiny French scream, in

silence. The silence, which persisted, was peculiar. Each

pair should have had something to tell the other, yet nothing

was told, or even asked. Mr. Gilman rowed with careful

science, and brought the dinghy alongside the yacht in an

unexceptionable manner. Musa stood on deck apart, acting

indifference. Madame Piriac, having climbed into the

Ariadne, went below at once. Miss Thompkins, seeing her

friend Mr. Price half-way down the saloon companion,

moved to speak to him, and they vanished together. Mr.

Gilman was respectfully informed by the engineer that the

skipper and Dr. Cromarty were ashore.
“How nice it is on the water!” said Audrey to Mr.

Gilman in a low, gentle voice. “There is a channel round

there with three feet of water in it at low tide.” She

sketched a curve in the air with her finger.

“Of course you know this part,” said Mr. Gilman

cautiously and even apprehensively. His glance seemed to

be saying: “And it was you who gave that fearful whistle,

too! Are you, can you be, all that I dreamed?”
“I do,” Audrey answered. “Would you like me to show

it you.”
“I should be more than delighted,” said Mr. Gilman.
With a gesture he summoned a man to untie the dinghy

again and hold it, and the man slid down into the dinghy

like a monkey.
“I’ll pull,” said Audrey, in the boat.
The man sprang out of the dinghy.
“One instant!” Mr. Gilman begged her, standing up in

the sternsheets, and popping his head through a porthole

of the saloon. “Mr. Price!”
“Sir?” From the interior.
“Will you be good enough to play that air with thirty-six

variations, of Beethoven’s? We shall hear splendidly

from the dinghy.”
“Certainly, sir.”
And Audrey said to herself: “You don’t want him to

flirt with Tommy while you’re away, so you’ve given him

something to keep him busy.”
Mr. Gilman remarked under his breath to Audrey:

“I think there is nothing finer than to hear Beethoven

on the water.”
“Oh! There isn’t!” she eagerly concurred.
Ignoring the thirty-six variations of Beethoven, Audrey

rowed slowly away, and after about a hundred yards the

boat had rounded a little knoll which marked the beginning

of a narrow channel known as the Lander Creek. The

thirty-six variations, however, would not be denied; they

softly impregnated the whole beautiful watery scene.
“Perhaps,” said Mr. Gilman suddenly, “perhaps your

ladyship was not quite pleased at me rowing-about with

Miss Thompkins—especially after I had taken her for a

walk.” He smiled, but his voice was rather wistful.

Audrey liked him prodigiously in that moment.
“Foolish man!” she replied, with a smile far surpassing

his, and she rested on her oars, taking care to keep the

boat in the middle of the channel. “Do you know why I

asked you to come out? I wanted to talk to you quite

privately. It is easier here.”
“I’m so glad!” he said simply and sincerely. And

Audrey thought: “Is it possible to give so much

pleasure to an important and wealthy man with so little

trouble?”
“Yes,” she said. “Of course you know who I really am,

don’t you, Mr. Gilman?”
“I only know you’re Mrs. Moncreiff,” he answered.
“But I’m not! Surely you’ve heard something? Surely

it’s been hinted in front of you?”
“Never!” said he.
“But haven’t you asked—about my marriage, for

instance?”
“To ask might have been to endanger your secret,” he

said.
“I see!” she murmured. “How frightfully loyal you

are, Mr. Gilman! I do admire loyalty. Well, I dare say

very, very few people do know. So I’ll tell you. That’s

my home over there.” And she pointed to Flank Hall,

whose chimneys could just be seen over the bank.
“I admit that I had thought so,” said Mr. Gilman.
“But naturally that was your home as a girl, before your

marriage.”
“I’ve never been married, Mr. Gilman,” she said. “I’m

only what the French call a jeune fille.”
His face changed; he seemed to be withdrawing alarmed

into himself.
“Never—been married?”
“Oh! You must understand me!” she went on, with

an appealing vivacity. “I was all alone. I was in mourning

for my father and mother. I wanted to see the world.

I just had to see it! I expect I was very foolish, but it

was so easy to put a ring on my finger and call myself Mrs.

And it gave me such advantages. And Miss Ingate agreed.

She was my mother’s oldest friend.... You’re vexed

with me.”
“You always seemed so wise,” Mr. Gilman faltered.
“Ah! That’s only the effect of my forehead!”
“And yet, you know, I always thought there was something

very innocent about you, too.”
“I don’t know what that was,” said Audrey. “But

honestly I acted for the best. You see I’m rather rich.

Supposing I’d only gone about as a young marriageable

girl—what frightful risks I should have run, shouldn’t I?

Somebody would be bound to have married me for my

money. And look at all I should have missed—without this

ring! I should never have met you in Paris, for instance,

and we should never have had those talks.... And—and

there’s a lot more reasons—I shall tell you another time—about

Madame Piriac and so on. Now do say you aren’t

vexed!”
”I think you’ve been splendid,” he said, with enthusiasm.

“I think the girls of to-day are splendid! I’ve

been a regular old fogey, that’s what it is.”
“Now there’s one thing I want you not to do,” Audrey

proceeded. “I want you not to alter the way you talk to

me. Because I’m really just the same girl I was last night.

And I couldn’t bear you to change.”
“I won’t! I won’t! But of course——”
“No, no! No buts. I won’t have it. Do you know

why I told you just this afternoon? Well, partly because

you were so perfectly sweet last night. And partly because

I’ve got a favour to ask you, and I wouldn’t ask it until

I’d told you.”
“You can’t ask me a favour,” he replied, “because it

wouldn’t be a favour. It would be my privilege.”
“But if you put it like that I can’t ask you.”
“You must!” he said firmly.
Then she told him something of the predicament of

Jane Foley. He listened with an expression of trouble.

Audrey finished bluntly: “She’s my friend. And I want

you to take her on the yacht to-night after it’s dark.

Nobody but you can save her. There! I’ve asked

you!”
“Jane Foley!” he murmured.
She could see that he was aghast. The syllables of that

name were notorious throughout Britain. They stood for

revolt, damage to property, defiance of law, injured policemen,

forcible feeding, and all sorts of phenomena that

horrified respectable pillars of society.
“She’s the dearest thing!” said Audrey. “You’ve no

idea. You’d love her. And she’s done as much for

Women’s Suffrage as anybody in the world. She’s a real

heroine, if you like. You couldn’t help the cause better

than by helping her. And I know how keen you are to

help.” And Audrey said to herself: “He’s as timid as a

girl about it. How queer men are, after all!”
“But what are we to do with her afterwards?” asked

Mr. Gilman. There was perspiration on his brow.
“Sail straight to France, of course. They couldn’t

touch her there, you see, because it’s political. It is

political, you know,” Audrey insisted proudly.
“And give up all our cruise?”
Audrey bent forward, as she had seen Tommy do. She

smiled enchantingly. “I quite understand,” she said, with

a sort of tenderness. “You don’t want to do it. And it

was a shame of me even to suggest it.”
“But I do want to do it,” he protested with splendid

despairful resolve. “I was only thinking of you—and the

cruise. I do want to do it. I’m absolutely at your disposal.

When you ask me to do a thing, I’m only too

proud. To do it is the greatest happiness I could have.”
Audrey replied softly:
“You deserve the Victoria Cross.”
“Whatever do you mean?” he demanded nervously.
“I don’t know exactly what I mean,” she said. “But

you’re the nicest man I ever knew.”
He blushed.
“You mustn’t say that to me,” he deprecated.
“I shall, and I shall.”
The sound of the thirty-six variations still came very

faintly over the water. The sun sent cataracts of warm

light across all the estuary. The water lapped against the

boat, and Audrey was overwhelmed by the inexplicable

marvel of being alive in the gorgeous universe.
“I shall have to back water,” she said, low. “There’s

no room to turn round here.”
“I suppose we’d better say as little about it as possible,”

he ventured.
“Oh! Not a word! Not a word till it’s done.”
“Yes, of course.” He was drenched in an agitating

satisfaction.
Five bells rang clear from the yacht, overmastering the

thirty-six variations.
Audrey thought:
“So he’d never agree, wouldn’t he, Madame Piriac!”

CHAPTER XXXVII
AFLOAT
That night, which was an unusually dark night for the time

of year, Audrey left the yacht, alone, to fetch Jane Foley.

She had made a provisional plan with Jane and Aguilar, and

the arrangement with Mr. Gilman had been of the simplest,

necessitating nothing save a brief order from the owner to

the woman whom Audrey could always amuse Mr. Gilman by

calling the “parlourmaid,” but who was more commonly

known as the stewardess. This young married creature had

prepared a cabin. For the rest little had been said. The

understanding between Mr. Gilman and Audrey was that

Mrs. Moncreiff should continue to exist, and that not a

word as to the arrival of Jane Foley should escape either of

them until the deed was accomplished. It is true that

Madame Piriac knew of the probable imminence of the

affair, but Madame Piriac was discretion elegantly attired,

and from the moment they had left Flank Hall together she

had been wise enough not even to mention Jane Foley

to Audrey. Madame Piriac appreciated the value of

ignorance in a questionable crisis. Mr. Gilman had been

less guarded. Indeed he had shown a tendency to discuss

the coming adventure with Audrey in remote corners—a

tendency which had to be discouraged because it gave to

both of them a too obvious air of being tremendous conspirators,

Also Audrey had had to dissuade him from

accompanying her to the Hall. He had rather conventional

ideas about women being abroad alone after dark, and he

abandoned them with difficulty even now.
As there were no street lamps alight in summer in the

village of Moze, Audrey had no fear of being recognised;

moreover, recognition by her former fellow-citizens could

now have no sinister importance; she did not much care

who recognised her. The principal gates of Flank Hall were

slightly ajar, as arranged with Aguilar, and she passed with

a suddenly aroused heart up the drive towards the front

entrance of the house. In spite of herself she could not get

rid of an absurd fear that either Mr. Hurley or Inspector

Keeble or both would jump out of the dark bushes and slip

handcuffs upon her wrists. And the baffling invisibility of

the sky further affected her nerves. There ought to have

been a lamp in the front hall, but no ray showed through

the eighteenth century fanlight over the door. She rang

the bell cautiously. She heard the distant ting. Aguilar,

according to the plan, ought to have opened; but he did not

open; nobody opened. She was instantly sure that she knew

what had happened. Mr. Hurley had been to Frinton and

ascertained that the Spatt story as to the tank-room was

an invention, and had returned with a search warrant and

some tools. But in another ten seconds she was equally sure

that nothing of the sort could have happened, for it was an

axiom with her that Aguilar’s masterly lying, based on

masterly listening at an attic door, had convinced Mr.

Hurley of the truth of the story about the tank-room.
Accidentally pushing against the front door with an

elbow in the deep obscurity, she discovered that it was not

latched. This was quite contrary to the plan. She stepped

into the house. The unforeseeing simpleton had actually

come on the excursion without a box of matches! She felt

her way, aided by the swift returning memories of childhood,

to the foot of the stairs, and past the stairs into the

kitchen, for in ancient days a candlestick with a box of

matches in it had always been kept on the ledge of the

small square window that gave light to the passage between

the hall and the kitchen. Her father had been most severely

particular about that candlestick (with matches) being-always

ready on that ledge in case of his need. Ridiculous,

of course, to expect a candlestick to be still there! Times

change so. But she felt for it, and there it was, and the

matches too! She lit the candle. The dim scene thus

revealed seemed strange enough to her after the electricity

of the Hôtel du Danube and of the yacht. It made her

want to cry....
She was one of those people who have room in their

minds for all sorts of things at once. And thus she could

simultaneously be worried to an extreme about Jane Foley,

foolish and sad about her immensely distant childhood, and

even regretful that she had admitted the fraudulence of the

wedding-ring on her hand. On the last point she had a

very strong sense of failure and disillusion. When she had

first donned a widow’s bonnet she had meant to have wondrous

adventures and to hear marvellous conversations as a

widow. And what had she done with her widowhood after

all? Nothing. She could not but think that she ought to

have kept it a little longer, on the chance....
Aguilar made a practice of sleeping in the kitchen; he

considered that a house could only be well guarded at night

from the ground floor. There was his bed, in the corner

against the brush and besom cupboard, all made up. Its

creaselessness, so characteristic of Aguilar, had not been

disturbed. The sight of the narrow bed made Audrey think

what a strange existence was the existence of Aguilar.

... Then, with a boldness that was half bluster, she went

upstairs, and the creaking of the woodwork was affrighting.
“Jane! Jane, dear!” she called out, as she arrived

at the second-storey landing. The sound of her voice was

uncanny in the haunted stillness. All Audrey’s infancy

floated up the well of the stairs and wrapped itself round

her and tightened her throat. She went along the passage

to the door of the tank-room.
“Jane, Jane!”
No answer! The door was locked. She listened. She

put her ear against the door in order to catch the faintest

sound of life within. But she could only hear the crude,

sharp ticking of the cheap clock which, as she knew,

Aguilar had supplied to Jane Foley. The vision of Jane

lying unconscious or dead obsessed her. Then she thrust

it away and laughed at it. Assuredly Aguilar and Jane

must have received some alarm as to a reappearance of

the police; they must have fled while there had yet been

time. Where could they have gone? Of course, through

the garden and plantation and down to the sea-wall,

whence Jane might steal to the yacht. Audrey turned

back towards the stairs, and the vast intimidating emptiness

of the gloomy house, lit by a single flickering candle,

assaulted her. She had to fight it before she could descend.

The garden door was latched, but not locked. Extinguishing

the candle, she went forth. The gusty breeze from the

estuary was now damp on her cheek with the presage

of rain. She hurried, fumbling as it were, through the

garden. When she achieved the hedge the spectacle of

the yacht, gleaming from stem to stern with electricity,

burst upon her; it shone like something desired and unattainable.

Carefully she issued from the grounds by the

little gate and crossed the intervening space to the dyke.

A dark figure moved in front of her, and her heart violently

jumped.
“Is that you, madam?”
It was the cold, imperturbable voice of Aguilar. At

once she felt reassured.
“Where is Miss Foley?” she demanded in a whisper.
“I’ve got her down here, ma’am,” said Aguilar. “I

presume as you’ve been to the house. We had to leave

it.”
“But the door of the tank-room was locked!”
“Yes, ma’am. I locked it a-purpose.... I thought

as it would keep the police employed a bit when they

come. I seen my cousin Sarah when I went to tell Miss

Ingate as you instructed me. My cousin Sarah seen

Keeble. They been to Frinton to Mrs. Spatt’s, and they

found out about that. And now the ’tec’s back, or nearly.

I reckon it was the warrant as was delaying him. So I

out with Miss Foley. I thought I could take her across

to the yacht from here. It wouldn’t hardly be safe for

her to walk round by the dyke. Hurley may have several

of his chaps about by this time.”
“But there’s not water enough, Aguilar.”
“Yes, madam. I dragged the old punt down. She

don’t draw three inches. She’s afloat now, and Miss

Foley’s in her. I was just a-going off. If you don’t mind

wetting your feet——”
In one minute Audrey had splashed into the punt.

Jane Foley took her hand in silence, and she heard Jane’s

low, happy laugh.
“Isn’t it funny?” Jane whispered.
Audrey squeezed her hand.
Aguilar pushed off with an oar, and he continued to

use the oar as a punt-pole, so that no sound of their

movement should reach the bank. Water was pouring into

the old sieve, and they touched ground once. But Aguilar

knew precisely what he was about and got her off again.

They approached the yacht with the slow, sure inexorability

of Aguilar’s character. A beam from the portholes of

the saloon caught Aguilar’s erect figure. He sat down,

poling as well as he could from the new position. When

they were a little nearer he stopped dead, holding the

punt firm by means of the pole fixed in the mud.
“He’s there afore us!” he murmured, pointing.
Under the Maltese cross of electric lights at the inner

end of the gangway could clearly be seen the form of

Mr. Hurley, engaged in conversation with Mr. Gilman.

Mr. Hurley was fairly on board.

CHAPTER XXXVIII
IN THE UNIVERSE
When Audrey, having been put ashore in execution of

a plan arranged with those naturally endowed strategists,

Aguilar and Jane Foley, arrived at the Hard by way of

the sea-wall, Mr. Hurley was still in parley with Mr.

Gilman under the Maltese cross of electric lights. From

the distance Mr. Gilman had an air of being somewhat

intimidated by the Irishman, but as soon as he distinguished

the figure of Audrey at the shore end of the

gangway his muscles became mysteriously taut, and his

voice charged with defiance.
“I have already told you, sir,” Audrey heard him say,

“there is no such person aboard the yacht. And I most

certainly will not allow you to search. You have no right

whatever to search, and you know it. You have my word.

My name is Gilman. You may have heard of me. I’m

chairman of the Board of Foodstuffs, Limited. Gilman, sir.

And I shall feel obliged if you will leave my decks.”
“Are you sailing to-night?” asked Mr. Hurley placidly.
“What the devil has that got to do with you, sir?”

replied Mr. Gilman gloriously.
Audrey, standing behind the detective and unseen by

him, observed the gloriousness of Mr. Gilman’s demeanour

and also Mr. Gilman’s desire that she should note the

same and appreciate it. She nodded violently several times

to Mr. Gilman, to urge him to answer the detective in

the affirmative.
“Ye-es, sir. Since you are so confoundedly inquisitive,

I am sailing to-night. I shall sail as soon as the tide

serves,” said Mr. Gilman hurriedly and fiercely, and then

glanced again at Audrey for further approval.
“Where for?” Mr. Hurley demanded.
“Where I please, sir,” Mr. Gilman snorted. By this

time he evidently imagined that he was furious, and was

taking pleasure in his fury.
Mr. Hurley, having given a little ironic bow, turned

to leave and found himself fronting Audrey, who stiffly

ignored his salute. The detective gone, Mr. Gilman walked

to and fro, breathing more loudly than ever, and unsuccessfully

pretending to a scattered audience, which consisted

of the skipper, Mr. Price, Dr. Cromarty, and sundry deck-hands,

that he had done nothing in particular and was

not a hero. As Audrey approached him he seemed to lay

all his glory with humble pride at her feet.
“Well, he brought that on himself!” said Audrey,

smiling.
“He did,” Mr. Gilman concurred, gazing at the Hard

with inimical scorn.
“She can’t come—now,” said Audrey. “It wouldn’t

be safe. He means to stay on the Hard till we’re gone.

He’s a very suspicious man.”
Mr. Hurley was indeed lingering just beyond the immediate

range of the Ariadne’s lamps.
“Can’t come! What a pity! What a pity!” murmured

Mr. Gilman, with an accent that was not a bit

sincere. The news was the best he had heard for hours.

“But I suppose,” he added, “we’d better sail just the

same, as I’ve said we should?” He did not want to run

the risk of getting Jane Foley after all.
“Oh! Do!” Audrey exclaimed. “It will be lovely! If it

doesn’t rain—and even if it does rain! We all like sailing at

night.... Are the others in the saloon? I’ll run down.”
“Mr. Wyatt,” the owner sternly accosted the captain.

“When can we get off?”
“Oh! About midnight,” Audrey answered quickly,

before Mr. Wyatt could compose his lips.
The men gazed at each other surprised by this show of

technical knowledge in a young widow. By the time Mr.

Wyatt had replied, Audrey was descending into the saloon.

It was Aguilar who, having ascertained the Ariadne’s

draught, had made the calculation as to the earliest possible

hour of departure.
And in the saloon Musa was, as it were, being enveloped

and kept comfortable in the admiring sympathy of Madame

Piriac and Miss Thompkins. Mr. Gilman’s violin lay

across his knees—perhaps he had been tuning it—and the

women inclined towards him, one on either side. It was

a sight that somewhat annoyed Audrey, who told herself

that she considered it silly. Admitting that Musa had

genius, she could not understand this soft flattery of

genius. She never flattered genius herself, and she did

not approve of others doing so. Certainly Musa was now

being treated on the yacht as a celebrity of the first

order, and Audrey could find no explanation of the steady

growth in the height and splendour of his throne.

Her arrival dissolved the spectacle. Within one minute,

somehow, the saloon was empty and everybody on deck

again.
And then, drawing her away, Musa murmured to Audrey

in a disconcerting tone that he must speak to her on a

matter of urgency, and that in order that he might do

so, they must go ashore and walk seawards, far from

interruption. She consented, for she was determined to

prove to him at close quarters that she was a different

creature from the other two. They moved to the gangway

amid discreet manifestations from the doctor and the

secretary—manifestations directed chiefly to Musa and

indicative of his importance as a notability. Audrey was

puzzled. For her, Musa was more than ever just Musa,

and less than ever a personage.
“I shall not return to the yacht,” he said, with an

excited bitterness, after they had walked some distance

along one of the paths leading past low bushes into the

wilderness of the marsh land that bounded the estuary

to the south. The sky was still invisible, but there was

now a certain amount of diffused light, and the pale path

could easily be distinguished amid the sombreness of

green. The yacht was hidden behind one of the knolls.

No sound could be heard. The breeze had died. That

which was around them—on either hand, above, below—was

the universe. They knew that they stood still in the

universe, and this idea gave their youth the sensation of

being very important.
“What is that which you say?” Audrey demanded

sharply in French, as Musa had begun in French. She

was aware, not for the first time with Musa, of the

sudden possibilities of drama in a human being. She

could scarcely make out his face, but she knew that he

was in a mood for high follies; she knew that danger was

gathering; she knew that the shape of the future was

immediately to be moulded by her and him, and chiefly

by herself. She liked it. The sensation of her importance

was reinforced.
“I say I shall never return to the yacht,” he repeated.
She thought compassionately:
“Poor foolish thing!”
She was incalculably older and wiser than this irrational

boy. She was the essence of wisdom.
She said, with acid detachment:
“But your luggage, your belongings? What an idea to

leave in this manner! It is so polite, so sensible!”
“I shall not return.”
“Of course,” she said, “I do not at all understand

why you are going. But what does that matter? You

are going.” Her indifference was superb. It was so

superb that it might have driven some men to destroy

her on the spot.
“Yes, you understand! I told you last night,” said

Musa, overflowing with emotion.
“Oh! You told me? I forget.”
“Naturally Monsieur Gilman is rich. I am not rich,

though I shall be. But you can’t wait,” Musa sneered.
“I do not know what you mean,” said Audrey.
“Ah!” said Musa. “Once I told you that Tommy

and Nick lent me the money with which to live. For me,

since then, you have never been the same being. How

stupid I was to tell you! You could not comprehend

such a thing. Your soul is too low to comprehend it.

Permit me to say that I have already repaid Nick. And

at the first moment I shall repay Tommy. My position

is secure. I have only to wait. But you will not wait.

You are a bourgeoise of the most terrible sort. Opulence

fascinates you. Mr. Gilman has opulence. He has nothing

else. But he has opulence, and for you that is all.”
In an instant her indifference, self-control, wisdom

vanished. It was a sad exhibition of frailty; but she

enjoyed it, she revelled in it, giving play to everything

in herself that was barbaric. The marsh around them

was probably as it had been before the vikings had sailed

into it, and Audrey rushed back with inconceivable speed

into the past and became the primeval woman of twenty

centuries earlier. Like almost all women she possessed

this wondrous and affrighting faculty.
“You are telling a wicked untruth!” she exploded in

English. “And what’s more, you know you are. You

disgust me. You know as well as I do I don’t care anything

for money—anything. Only you’re a horrid, spoilt

beast. You think you can upset me, but you can’t. I

won’t have it, either from you or from anybody else. It’s

a shame, that’s what it is. Now you’ve got to apologise

to me. I absolutely insist on it. You aren’t going to

bully me, even if you think you are. I’ll soon show you

the sort of girl I am, and you make no mistake! Are

you going to apologise or aren’t you?”
The indecorous creature was breathing as loudly as Mr.

Gilman himself.
“I admit it,” said Musa yielding.
“Ah!”
“I demand your pardon. I knew that what I said was

not true. I am outside myself. But what would you? It

is stronger than I. This existence is terrible, on the yacht.

I cannot support it. I shall become mad. I am ruined.

My jealousy is intolerable.”
“It is!” said Audrey, using French again, more calmly,

having returned to the twentieth century.
“It is intolerable to me.” Then Musa’s voice changed

and grew persuasive, rather like a child’s. “I cannot live

without you. That is the truth. I am an artist, and you

are necessary to me and to my career.” He lifted his head.

“And I can offer you everything that is most brilliant.”
“And what about my career?” Audrey questioned

inimically.
“Your career?” He seemed at a loss.
“Yes. My career. It has possibly not occurred to you

that I also may have a career.”
Musa became appealing.
“You understand me,” he said. “I told you you do not

comprehend, but you comprehend everything. It is that

which enrages me. You have had experience. You know

what men are. You could teach me so much. I hate young

girls. I have always hated them. They are so tasteless, so

insufferably innocent. I could not talk to a young girl as I

talk to you. It would be absurd. Now as to my career—what

I said——”
“Musa,” she interrupted him, with a sinister quietude,

“I want to tell you something. But you must promise to

keep it secret. Will you?”
He assented, impatient.
“It is not possible!” he exclaimed, when she had told

him that she belonged to precisely the category of human

beings whom he hated and despised.
“Isn’t it?” said she. “Now I hope you see how little

you know, really, about women.” She laughed.
“It is not possible!” he repeated. And then he said

with deliberate ingenuousness: “I am so content. I am so

happy. I could not have hoped for it. It is overwhelming.

I am everything you like of the most idiotic, blind, stupid.

But now I am happy. Could I ever have borne that you

had loved before I knew you? I doubt if I could have borne

it. Your innocence is exquisite. It is intoxicating to me.”
“Musa,” she remarked dryly; “I wish you would remember

that you are in England. People do not talk in that

way in England. It simply is not done. And I will not

listen to it.” Her voice grew a little tender. “Why can

we not just be friends?”
“It is folly,” said he, with sudden disgust. “And it

would kill me.”
“Well, then,” she replied, receding. “You’re entitled

to die.”
He advanced towards her. She kept him away with a

gesture.
“You want me to marry you?” she questioned.
“It is essential,” he said, very seriously. “I adore you.

I can’t do anything because of you. I can’t think of anything

but you. You are more marvellous than anyone can

be. You cannot appreciate what you are to me!”
“And suppose you are nothing to me?”
“But it is necessary that you should love me!”
“Why? I see no necessity. You want me—because you

want me. That’s all. I can’t help it if you’re mad. Your

attitude is insulting. You have not given one thought to

my feelings. And if I said ‘yes’ to you, you’d marry

me whatever my feelings were. You think only of yourself.

It is the old attitude. And when I offer you my friendship,

you instantly decline it. That shows how horribly French

you are. Frenchmen can’t understand the idea of friendship

between a man and a girl. They sneer at it. It shows

what brutes you all are. Why should I marry you? I

should have nothing to gain by it. You’ll be famous. Well,

what do I care? Do you think it would be very amusing

for me to be the wife of a famous man that was run after

by every silly creature in Paris or London or New York?

Not quite! And I don’t see myself. You don’t like young

girls. I don’t like young men. They’re rude and selfish

and conceited. They’re like babies.”
“The fact is,” Musa broke in, “you are in love with

the old Gilman.”
“He is not old!” cried Audrey. “In some ways he is

much less worn out than you are. And supposing I am in

love with Mr. Gilman? Does it regard you? Do not be

rude. Mr. Gilman is at any rate polite. He is not capricious.

He is reliable. You aren’t reliable. You want someone

upon whom you can rely. How nice for your wife! You

play the violin. True. You are a genius. But you cannot

always be on the platform. And when you are not on the

platform...! Heavens! If I wish to hear you play I

can buy a seat and come and hear you and go away again.

But your wife, responsible for your career—she will never

be free. Her life will be unbearable. What anxiety!

Misery, I should say rather! You would have the lion’s

share of everything. Now for myself I intend to have the

lion’s share. And why shouldn’t I? Isn’t it about time

some woman had it? You can’t have the lion’s share if you

are not free. I mean to be free. If I marry I shall want

a husband that is not a prison.... Thank goodness I’ve

got money.... Without that——!”
“Then,” said Musa, “you have no feeling for me.”
“Love?” she laughed exasperatingly.
“Yes,” he said.
“Not that much!” She snapped her fingers. “But"—in

a changed tone—"I should like to like you. I shall be

very disgusted if your concerts are not a tremendous success.

And they will not be if you don’t keep control over yourself

and practise properly. And it will be your fault.”
“Then, good-bye!” he said, coldly ignoring all her

maternal suggestions. And turned away.
“Where are you going to?”
He stopped.
“I do not know. But if I do not deceive myself I have

already informed you that in certain circumstances I should

not return to the yacht.”
“You are worse than a schoolboy.”
“It is possible.”
“Anyway, I shan’t explain on the yacht. I shall tell

them that I know nothing about it.”
“But no one will believe you,” he retorted maliciously

over his shoulder. And then he was gone.
She at any rate was no longer surrounded by the largeness

of the universe. He might still be, but she was not.

She was in mind already on the yacht trying to act a

surprise equal to the surprise of the others when Musa

failed to reappear. She was very angry with him, not

because he had been a rude schoolboy and was entirely impossible

as a human being, but because she had allowed

herself to leave the yacht with him and would therefore be

compelled sooner or later to answer questions about him.

She seriously feared that Mr. Gilman might refuse to sail

unless she confessed to him her positive knowledge that

Musa would not be seen again, and that thus she might

have to choose between the failure of her plans for Jane

Foley and her own personal discomfiture.
Instead of being in the mighty universe she was

struggling amid the tiresome littleness of society on a yacht.

She hated yachts for their very cosiness and their quality

of keeping people close together who wanted to be far

apart. And as she watched the figure of Musa growing

fainter she was more than ever impressed by the queerness of

men. Women seemed to be so logical, so realistic, so

understandable, so calculable, whereas men were enigmas

of waywardness and unreason. At just that moment her

feet reminded her that they had been wetted by the adventure

in the punt, and she said to herself sagely that she

must take precautions against a chill.
And then she thought she detected some unusual phenomenon

behind a clump of bushes to the right which hid a

plank-bridge across a waterway. She would have been

frightened if she had not been very excited. And in her

excitement she marched straight up to the clump, and

found Mr. Hurley in a crouching posture. She started, and

recovered.
“I might have known!” she said disdainfully.
“We all make mistakes,” said Mr. Hurley defensively.

“We all make mistakes. I knew I’d made a mistake as

soon as I got here, but I couldn’t get away quietly enough.

And you talked so loud. Ye’ll admit I had just cause for

suspicion. And being a very agreeable lady ye’ll pardon

me.”
She blushed, and then ceased blushing because it was

too dark for him to perceive the blush, and she passed on

without a word. When, across the waste, she had come

within sight of the yacht again, she heard footsteps behind

her, and turned to withstand the detective. But the

overtaker was Musa.
“It is necessary that I should return to the yacht,” he

said savagely. “The thought of you and Monsieur Gilman

together, without me.... No! I did not know myself.

 ... I did not know myself.... It is impossible for me

to leave.”
She made no answer. They boarded the yacht as though

they had been for a stroll. Few could have guessed that

they had come back from the universe terribly scathed.

Accepting deferential greetings as a right, Musa vanished

rapidly to his cabin.
Several hours later Audrey and Mr. Gilman, alone among

the passengers, were standing together, both tarpaulined,

on the starboard bow, gazing seaward as the yacht cautiously

felt her way down Mozewater. Captain Wyatt, and not

Mr. Gilman, was at the binnacle. A little rain was falling

and the night was rather thick but not impenetrable.
“There’s the light!” said Audrey excitedly.
“What sharp eyes you have!” said Mr. Gilman. “I

can see it, too.” He spoke a word to the skipper, and

the skipper spoke, and then the engine went still more

slowly.
The yacht approached the Flank buoy dead slow,

scarcely stemming the tide. The Moze punt was tied up

to the buoy, and Aguilar held a lantern on a boathook,

while Jane Foley, very wet, was doing a spell of baling.

Aguilar dropped the boathook and, casting off, brought

the punt alongside the yacht. The steps were lowered and

Jane Foley, with laughing, rain-sprinkled face, climbed up.

Aguilar handed her bag which contained nearly everything

she possessed on earth. She and Audrey kissed calmly, and

Audrey presented Mr. Gilman to a suddenly shy Jane. In

the punt Miss Foley had been seen to take an affectionate

leave of Aguilar. She now leaned over the rail.
“Good-bye!” she said, with warmth. “Thanks ever so

much. It’s been splendid. I do hope you won’t be too

wet. Can you row all the way home?” She shivered.
“I shall go back on the tide, Miss Foley,” answered

Aguilar.
He touched his cap to Audrey, mumbled gloomily a

salutation, and loosed his hold on the yacht; and at once the

punt felt the tide and began to glide away in the darkness

towards Moze. The yacht’s engine quickened. Flank

buoy faded.
Mr. Gilman and the two girls made a group.
“You’re wonderful! You really are!” said Mr. Gilman,

addressing apparently the pair of them. He was enthusiastic.

... He added with grandeur, “And now for

France!”
“I do hope Mr. Hurley is still hanging about Moze,”

said Audrey. “Mr. Gilman, shall I show Miss Foley her

cabin? She’s rather wet.”
“Oh, do! Oh, do, please! But don’t forget that we

are to have supper together. I insist on supper.”
And Audrey thought: “How agreeable he is! How

kind-hearted! He hasn’t got any ‘career’ to worry about,

and I adore him, and he’s as simple as knitting.”

CHAPTER XXXIX
THE IMMINENT DRIVE
“Oh!” cried Miss Thompkins. “You can see it from

here. It’s funny how unreal it seems, isn’t it?”
She pointed at one of the large white-curtained windows

of the restaurant, through which was visible a round

column covered with advertisements of theatres, music-halls,

and concert-halls, printed in many colours and announcing

superlative delights. Names famous wherever

pleasure is understood gave to their variegated posters a

pleasant air of distinguished familiarity—names of theatres

such as “Variétés,” “Vaudeville,” “Châtelet,” “Théâtre

Français,” “Folies-Bergère,” and names of persons such as

“Sarah Bernhardt,” “Huegenet,” “Le Bargy,” “Litvinne,”

“Lavallière.” But the name in the largest type—dark

crimson letters on rose paper—the name dominating all the

rest, was the name of Musa. The ingenuous stranger to

Paris was compelled to think that as an artist Musa was

far more important than anybody else. Along the length of

all the principal boulevards, and in many of the lesser

streets, the ingenuous stranger encountered, at regular distances

of a couple of hundred yards or so, one of these

columns planted on the kerb; and all the scores of them

bore exactly the same legend; they all spoke of nothing but

blissful diversions, and they all put Musa ahead of anybody

else in the world of the stage and the platform. Sarah

Bernhardt herself, dark blue upon pale, was a trifle compared

to Musa on the columns. And it had been so for

days. Other posters were changed daily—changed by

mysterious hands before even bread-girls were afoot with

their yards of bread—but the space given to Musa repeated

always the same tidings, namely that Musa ("the great

violinist") was to give an orchestral concert at the Salle

Xavier, assisted by the Xavier orchestra, on Thursday,

September 24, at 9 P.M. Particulars of the programme

followed.
Paris was being familiarised with Musa. His four

letters looked down upon the fever of the thoroughfares;

they were perused by tens of thousands of sitters in cafés

and in front of cafés; they caught the eye of men and

women fleeing from the wrath to come in taxicabs; they

competed successfully with newspaper placards; and on that

Thursday—for the Thursday in question had already run

more than half its course—they had so entered into the

sub-conscious brain of Paris that no habitué of the streets,

whatever his ignorant indifference to the art of music,

could have failed to reply with knowledge, on hearing Musa

mentioned, “Oh, yes!” implying that he was fully acquainted

with the existence of the said Musa.
Tommy was right: there did seem to be a certain unreality

about the thing, yet it was utterly real.
All the women turned to glance at the name through the

window, and some of them murmured sympathetic and interested

exclamations and bright hopes. There were five

women: Miss Thompkins, Miss Nickall, Madame Piriac,

Miss Ingate and Audrey. And there was one man—Mr.

Gilman. And the six were seated at a round table in the

historic Parisian restaurant. Mr. Gilman had the air

triumphant, and he was entitled to it. The supreme moment

of his triumph had come. Having given a luncheon to these

ladies, he had just asked, with due high negligence, for the

bill. If there was one matter in which Mr. Gilman was a

truly great expert, it was the matter of giving a meal in a

restaurant. He knew how to dress for such an affair—with

strict conventionality but a touch of devil-may-care youthfulness

in the necktie. He knew how to choose the

restaurant; he had about half a dozen in his répertoire—all

of the first order and for the most part combining the

exclusive with the amusing—entirely different in kind from

the pandemonium where Audrey had eaten on the night of

her first arrival in Paris; he knew how to get the best out

of head-waiters and waiters, who in these restaurants were

not head-waiters and waiters but worldly priests and

acolytes; his profound knowledge of cookery sprang from

a genuine interest in his stomach, and he could compose a

menu in a fashion to command the respect of head-waiters

and to excite the envy of musicians composing a sonata; he

had the wit to look in early and see to the flowers; above all

he was aware what women liked in the way of wine, and

since this was never what he liked in the way of wine, he

would always command a half-bottle of the extra dry for

himself, but would have it manipulated with such discretion

that not a guest could notice it. He paid lavishly and

willingly, convinced by hard experience that the best is

inestimable, but he felt too that the best was really quite

cheap, for he knew that there were imperfectly educated

people in the world who thought nothing of paying the price

of a good meal for a mere engraving or a bit of china.

Withal, he never expected his guests truly to appreciate the

marvels he offered them. They could not, or very rarely.

Their twittering ecstatic praise, which was without understanding,

sufficed for him, though sometimes he would give

gentle diffident instruction. This trait in him was very

attractive, proving the genuineness of his modesty.
The luncheon was partly to celebrate the return of various

persons to Paris, but chiefly in honour of Musa’s concert.

Musa could not be present, for distinguished public performers

do not show themselves on the day of an appearance.

Mr. Gilman had learnt this from Madame Piriac, whom he

had consulted as to the list of guests. It is to be said that

he bore the absence of Musa from his table with stoicism.

For the rest, Madame Piriac knew that he wanted no other

men, and she had suggested none. She had assumed that

he desired Audrey, and had pointed out that Audrey could

not well be invited without Miss Ingate, who, sick of her

old Moze, had rejoined Audrey in the splendour of the Hôtel

du Danube. Mr. Gilman had somehow mentioned Miss

Thompkins, whereupon Madame Piriac had declared that

Miss Thompkins involved Miss Nickall, who after a complete

recovery from the broken arm had returned for a while to

her studio. And then Mr. Gilman had closed the list, saying

that six was enough, and exactly the right number.
“At what o’clock are you going for the drive?” asked

Madame Piriac in her improved, precise English. She

looked equally at her self-styled uncle and at Audrey.
“I ordered the car for three o’clock,” answered Mr.

Gilman. “It is not yet quite three.”
The table with its litter of ash-trays, empty cups, empty

small glasses, and ravaged sweets, and the half-deserted

restaurant, and the polite expectant weariness of the priests

and acolytes, all showed that the hour was in fact not quite

three—an hour at which such interiors have invariably the

aspect of roses overblown and about to tumble to pieces.
And immediately upon the reference to the drive everybody

at the table displayed a little constraint, avoiding the

gaze of everybody else, thus demonstrating that the imminent

drive was a delicate, without being a disagreeable, topic.

Which requires explanation.
Mr. Gilman had not been seen by any of his guests

during the summer. He had landed them at Boulogne from

the Ariadne—sound but for one casualty. That casualty

was Jane Foley, suffering from pneumonia, which had presumably

developed during the evening of exposure spent

with Aguilar in the leaking punt and in rain showers.

Madame Piriac and Audrey took her to Wimereux and there

nursed her through a long and sometimes dangerous illness.

Jane possessed no constitution, but she had obstinacy, which

saved her. In her convalescence, part of which she spent

alone with Audrey (Madame Piriac having to pay visits to

Monsieur Piriac), she had proceeded with the writing of a

book, and she had also received in conclave the rarely seen

Rosamund, who like herself was still a fugitive from British

justice. These two had been elaborating a new plan of

campaign, which was to include an incursion by themselves

into England, and which had in part been confided by Jane

to Audrey, who, having other notions in her head, had been

somewhat troubled thereby. Audrey’s conscience had

occasionally told her to throw herself heartily into the campaign,

but her individualistic instincts had in the end kept

her safely on a fence between the campaign and something

else. The something else was connected with Mr. Gilman.
Mr. Gilman had written to her regularly; he had sent

dazzling subscriptions to the Suffragette Union; and

Audrey had replied regularly. His letters were very simple,

very modest, and quite touching. They were dated from

various coastal places. However, he never came near

Wimereux, though it was a coastal place. Audrey had

excusably deemed this odd; but Madame Piriac having once

said with marked casualness, “I hinted to him that he might

with advantage stay away,” Audrey had concealed her

thoughts on the point. And one of her thoughts was that

Madame Piriac was keeping them apart so as to try them,

so as to test their mutual feelings. The policy, if it was

a policy, was very like Madame Piriac; it had the effect

of investing Mr. Gilman in Audrey’s mind with a peculiar

romantic and wistful charm, as of a sighing and obedient

victim. Then Jane Foley and Rosamund had gone off somewhere,

and Madame Piriac and Audrey had returned to

Paris, and had found that practically all Paris had returned

to Paris too. And on the first meeting with Mr. Gilman it

had been at once established that his feelings and those of

Audrey had surmounted the Piriac test. Within forty-eight

hours all persons interested had mysteriously assumed

that Mr. Gilman and Audrey were coupled together by fate

and that a delicious crisis was about to supervene in their

earthly progress. And they had become objects of exquisite

solicitude. They had also become perfect. A circle of

friends and acquaintances waited in excited silence for a

palpitating event, as a populace waits for the booming gunfire

which is to inaugurate a national rejoicing. And when

the news exuded that he was taking her for a drive to

Meudon, which she had never seen, alone, all decided beyond

any doubt that he would do it during the drive.
Hence the nice constraint at the table when the drive

grew publicly and avowedly imminent.
Audrey, as the phrase is, “felt her position keenly,” but

not unpleasantly, nor with understanding. Not a word had

passed of late between herself and Mr. Gilman that any

acquaintance might not have listened to. Indeed, Mr.

Gilman had become slightly more formal. She liked him

for that, as she liked him for a large number of qualities.

She did not know whether she loved him. And strange to

say, the question did not passionately interest her. The

only really interesting questions were: Would he propose

to her? And would she accept him? She had no logical

ground for assuming that he would propose to her. None

of her friends had informed her of the general expectation

that he would propose to her. Yet she knew that everybody

expected him to propose to her quite soon—indeed within

the next couple of hours. And she felt that everybody was

right. The universe was full of mysteries for Audrey. As

regards her answer to any proposal, she foresaw—another

mystery—that it would not depend upon self-examination or

upon reason, or upon anything that could be defined. It

would depend upon an instinct over which her mind—nay,

even her heart—had no control. She was quite certainly

aware that this instinct would instruct her brain to instruct

her lips to say “Yes.” The idea of saying “No” simply

could not be conceived. All the forces in the universe would

combine to prevent her from saying “No.”
The one thing that might have countered that enigmatic

and powerful instinct was a consideration based upon the

difference between her age and that of Mr. Gilman. It is

true that she did not know what the difference was, because

she did not know Mr. Gilman’s age. And she could not ask

him. No! Such is the structure of society that she could

not say to Mr. Gilman, “By the way, Mr. Gilman, how old

are you?” She could properly ascertain his tastes about

all manner of fundamental points, such as the shape of chair-legs,

the correct hour for dining, or the comparative merits

of diamonds and emeralds; but this trifle of information

about his age could not be asked for. And he did not make

her a present of it. She might have questioned Madame

Piriac, but she could not persuade herself to question Madame

Piriac either. However, what did it matter? Even if she

learnt his age to a day, he would still be precisely the same

Mr. Gilman. And let him be as old or as young as he might,

she was still his equal in age. She was far more than six

months older than she had been six months ago.
The influence of Madame Piriac through the summer had

indirectly matured her. For above all Madame Piriac had

imperceptibly taught her the everlasting joy and duty of

exciting the sympathy, admiration and gratitude of the other

sex. Hence Audrey had aged at a miraculous rate because

in order to please Mr. Gilman she wished—possibly without

knowing it—to undo the disparity between herself and him.

This may be strange, but it is assuredly more true than

strange. To the same ends she had concealed her own age.

Nobody except Miss Ingate knew how old she was. She

only made it clear, when doubts seemed to exist, that she

had passed her majority long before. Further, her wealth,

magnified by legend, assisted her age. Not that she was so

impressed by her wealth as she had been. She had met

American women in Paris compared to whom she was at

destitution’s door. She knew one woman who had kept a

2,000-ton yacht lying all summer in the outer harbour at

Boulogne, and had used it during that period for exactly

eleven hours.
Few of these people had an establishment. They would

rent floors in hotels, or châteaux in Touraine, or yachts, but

they had no home, and yet they seemed very content and

beyond doubt they were very free. And so Audrey did not

trouble about having a home. She had Moze, which was

more than many of her acquaintances had. She would not

use it, but she had it. And she was content in the knowledge

of the power to create a home when she felt inclined

to create one. Not that it would not have been absurd to set

about creating a home with Mr. Gilman hanging over her

like a destiny. It would have been rude to him to do so;

it would have been to transgress against the inter-sexual

code as promulgated by Madame Piriac.... She wondered

what sort of a place Meudon was, and whether he

would propose to her while they were looking at the view

together.... She trembled with the sense of adventure,

which had little to do with happiness or unhappiness....

But would he propose to her? Not improbably the whole

conception of the situation was false and she was being

ridiculous!
Still the nice constraint persisted as the women began

to put on their gloves, while Mr. Gilman had a word with

the chief priest. And Audrey had the illusion of being a

dedicated victim. As she self-consciously and yet proudly

handled her gloves she could not help but notice the simple

gold wedding-ring on a certain finger. She had never

removed it. She had never formally renounced her claim

to the status of a widow. That she was not a widow, that

she had been guilty of a fraud on a gullible public, was

somehow generally known; but the facts were not referred

to, save perhaps in rare hints by Tommy, and she had continued

to be known as Mrs. Moncreiff. Ignominious close

to a daring enterprise! And in the circumstances nothing

was more out of place than the ring, bought in cold, wilful,

calculating naughtiness at Colchester.
Just when Miss Ingate was beginning to discuss her own

plans for the afternoon, Mr. Price entered the restaurant,

and as he did so Miss Thompkins, saying something about

the small type on the poster outside, went to the window to

examine it. Mr. Price, disguised as a discreet dandy-about-town,

bore a parcel of music. He removed a most glossy

hat; he bowed to the whole company of ladies, who

responded with smiles in which was acknowledge that

he was a dandy in addition to being a secretary; and

lastly with deference he handed the parcel of music to

Mr. Gilman.
“So you did get it! What did I tell you?” said Mr.

Gilman with negligent condescension. “A minute later,

and we should have been gone.... Has Mr. Price got this

right?” he asked Audrey, putting the music respectfully in

front of her.
It included the reduced score of the Beethoven violin

concerto, and other items to be performed that night at the

Salle Xavier.
“Oh! Thank you, Mr. Price!” said Audrey. The

music was so fresh and glossy and luscious to the eye that

it was like a gift of fruit.
“That’ll do, then, Price,” said Mr. Gilman. “Don’t forget

about those things for to-night, will you?”
“No, sir. I have a note of all of them.”
Mr. Price bowed and turned away, assuming his perfect

hat. As he approached the door Tommy intercepted him;

and said something to him in a low voice, to which he uncomfortably

mumbled a reply. As they had admittedly been

friends in Mr. Price’s artistic days, exception could not be

taken to this colloquy. Nevertheless Audrey, being as

suspicious as a real widow, regarded it ill, thinking all

manner of things. And when Tommy, humming, came

back to her seat on Mr. Gilman’s left hand, Audrey

thought: “And why, after all, should she be on his left

hand? It is of course proper that I should be on his right,

but why should Tommy be on his left? Why not Madame

Piriac or Miss Ingate?”
“And what am I going to do this afternoon?” demanded

Miss Ingate, lengthening the space between her nose and her

upper lip, and turning down the corners of her lower lip.
“You have to try that new dress on, Winnie,” said

Audrey rather reprovingly.
“Alone? Me go alone there? I wouldn’t do it. It’s

not respectable the way they look at you and add you up

and question you in those trying-on rooms, when they’ve

got you.”
“Well, take Elise with you.”
“Me take Elise? I won’t do it, not unless I could keep

her mouth full of pins all the time. Whenever we’re alone,

and her mouth isn’t full of pins, she always talks to me as

if I was an actress. And I’m not.”
“Well, then,” said Miss Nickall kindly, “come with me

and Tommy. We haven’t anything to do, and I’m taking

Tommy to see Jane Foley. Jane would love to see you.”
“She might,” replied Miss Ingate. “Oh! She might.

But I think I’ll walk across to the hotel and just go to bed

and sleep it off.”
“Sleep what off?” asked Tommy, with necklace rattling

and orchidaceous eyes glittering.
“Oh! Everything! Everything!” shrieked Miss

Ingate.
There was one other customer left in the restaurant, a

solitary fair, fat man, and as Mr. Gilman’s party was leaving,

Audrey last, this solitary fair, fat man caught her eye,

bowed, and rose. It was Mr. Cowl, secretary of the

National Reformation Society. He greeted her with the

assurance of an old and valued friend, and he called her

neither Miss nor Mrs.; he called her nothing at all. Audrey

accepted his lead.
“And is your Society still alive?” she asked with casual

polite disdain.
“Going strong!” said Mr. Cowl. “More flourishing

than ever—in spite of our bad luck.” He lifted his sandy-coloured

eyebrows. “Of course I’m here on Society business.

In fact, I often have to come to Paris on Society

business.” His glance deprecated the appearance of the

table over which his rounded form was protruding.
“Well, I’m glad to have seen you again,” said Audrey,

holding out her hand.
“I wonder,” said Mr. Cowl, drawing some tickets from

his pocket. “I wonder whether you—and your friends—would

care to go to a concert to-night at the Salle Xavier.

The concierge at my hotel is giving tickets away, and I

took some—rather to oblige him than anything else. For

one never knows when a concierge may not be useful. I

don’t suppose it will be anything great, but it will pass the

time, and—er—strangers in Paris——”
“Thank you, Mr. Cowl, but I’m not a stranger in Paris.

I live here.”
“Oh! I beg your pardon,” said Mr. Cowl. “Excuse

me. Then you won’t take them? Pity! I hate to see

anything wasted.”
Audrey was both desolated and infuriated.
“Remember me respectfully to Miss Ingate, please,”

finished Mr. Cowl. “She didn’t see me as she passed.”
He returned the tickets to his pocket.
Outside, Madame Piriac, standing by her automobile,

which had rolled up with the silence of an hallucination,

took leave of Audrey.
“Eh bien! Au revoir!“ said she shortly, with a peculiar

challenging half-smile, which seemed to be saying, “Are you

going to be worthy of my education? Let us hope so.”
And Miss Nickall, with her grey hair growing fluffier

under a somewhat rakish hat, said with a smile of sheer

intense watchful benevolence:
“Well, good-bye!”
While Nick was ecstatically thanking Mr. Gilman for

his hospitality, Tommy called Audrey aside. Madame

Piriac’s car had vanished.
“Have you heard about the rehearsal this morning?”

she asked, in a confidential tone, anxious and yet quizzical.
“No! What about it?” Audrey demanded. Various

apprehensions were competing for attention in her brain.

The episode of Mr. Cowl had agitated her considerably.

And now she was standing right against the column

bearing Musa’s name in those large letters, and other

columns up and down the gay, busy street echoed clear

the name. And how unreal it was!... Tickets being

given away in half-dozens!... She ought to have been

profoundly disturbed by such a revelation, and she was.

But here was the drive with Mr. Gilman insisting on a

monopoly of all her faculties. And on the top of everything—Tommy

with her strange gaze and tone! Tommy

carefully hesitated before replying.
“He lost his temper and left it in the middle—orchestra

and conductor and Xavier and all! And he swore he

wouldn’t play to-night.”
“Nonsense!”
“Yes, he did.”
“Who told you?”
Already the two women were addressing each other

as foes.
“A man I know in the orchestra.”
“Why didn’t you tell us at once—when you came?”
“Well, I didn’t want to spoil the luncheon. But of

course I ought to have done. You, at any rate, seeing

your interest in the concert! I’m sorry.”
“My interest in the concert?” Audrey objected.
“Well, my girl,” said Tommy, half cajolingly and half

threateningly, “you aren’t going to stand there and tell

me to my face that you haven’t put up that concert

for him?”
“Put up the concert! Put up the——” Audrey knew

she was blushing.
“Paid for it! Paid for it!” said Tommy, with

impatience.

CHAPTER XL
GENIUS AT BAY
Audrey got away from the group in front of the restaurant

with stammering words and crimson confusion. She ran.

She stopped a taxi and stumbled into it. There remained

with her vividly the vision of the startled, entirely puzzled

face of Mr. Gilman, who in an instant had been transformed

from a happy, dignified and excusably self-satisfied

human male into an outraged rebel whose grievance had

overwhelmed his dignity. She had said hurriedly: “Please

excuse me not coming with you. But Tommy says something’s

happened to Musa, and I must go and see. It’s

very important.” And that was all she had said. Had

she asked him to drive her to Musa’s, Mr. Gilman would

have been very pleased to do so; but she did not think

of that till it was too late. Her precipitancy had been

terrible, and had staggered even Tommy. She had no

idea how the group would arrange itself. And she had

no very clear idea as to what was wrong with Musa or

how matters stood in regard to the concert. Tommy had

asserted that she did not know whether the orchestra and

its conductor meant to be at their desks in the evening

just as though nothing whatever had occurred at the

rehearsal. All was vague, and all was disturbing. She

had asked Tommy the authority for her assertion that

she, Audrey, was financing the concert. To which Tommy

had replied that she had “guessed, of course.” And seeing

that Audrey had only interviewed a concert agent once—and

he a London concert agent with relations in Paris

—and that she had never uttered a word about the affair

to anybody except Mr. Foulger, who had been keeping

an eye on the expenditure, it was not improbable that

Tommy had just guessed. But she had guessed right.

She was an uncanny woman. “Have you ever spoken

to Musa about—it?” Audrey had passionately demanded;

and Tommy had answered also passionately: “Of course

not. I’m a white woman all through. Haven’t you learnt

that yet?”
The taxi, although it was a horse-taxi and incapable of

moving at more than five miles an hour, reached the Rue

Cassette, which was on the other side of the river and

quite a long way off, in no time. That is to say, Audrey

was not aware that any time had passed. She had

received the address from Tommy, for it was a new

address, Musa having admittedly risen in the world. The

house was an old one; it had a curious staircase, with

china knobs on the principal banisters of the rail, and

crimson-tasselled bell cords at all the doors of the flats.

Musa lived at the summit of it. Audrey arrived there

short of breath, took the crimson-tasselled cord in her

hand to pull, and then hesitated in order to think.
Why had she come? The response was clear. She

had come solely because she hated to see a job botched,

and there was not a moment to lose if it was not to be

botched. She had come, not because she had the slightest

sympathetic interest in Musa—on the contrary, she was

coldly angry with him—but because she had a horror of

fiascos. She had found a genius who needed financing,

and she, possessing some tons of money, had financed

him, and she did not mean to see an ounce of her money

wasted if she could help it. Her interest in the affair

was artistic and impersonal, and none other. It was the

duty of wealthy magnates to foster art, and she was

fostering art, and she would have the thing done neatly

and completely, or she would know the reason. Fancy

a rational creature making a scene at a final rehearsal

and swearing that he would not play, and then bolting!

It was monstrous! People really did not do such things.

Assuredly no artist had ever done such a thing before.

Artists who had a concert all to themselves invariably

appeared according to advertised promise. An artist who

was only one among several in a programme might fall

ill and fail to appear, for such artists are liable to the

accidents of earthly existence. But an artist who shared

the programme with nobody else was above the accidents

of earthly existence and magically protected against colds,

coughs, influenza, orange peel, automobiles, and all the

other enemies of mankind. But, of course, Musa was

peculiar, erratic and unpredictable beyond even the wide

range granted by society to genius. And yet of late he

had been behaving himself in a marvellous manner. He

had never bothered her. On the voyage back to France

he had not bothered her. They had separated with

punctilious cordiality. Neither of them had written to the

other, but she knew that he was working diligently and

satisfactorily. He was apparently cured of her. It was

perhaps due to the seeming completeness of his cure that

her relations with Mr. Gilman had been what they were.

... And now, suddenly, this!
So with clear conscience she pulled the bell cord.
Musa himself opened the door. He was coatless and

in a dressing-gown, under which showed glimpses of a new

smartness. As soon as he saw her he went very pale.
“Bon jour,” she said.
He repeated the phrase stiffly.
“Can I come in?” she asked.
He silently signified, with a certain annoying resignation,

that she might. For one instant she was under a

tremendous impulse to walk grandly and haughtily down the

stairs. But she conquered the impulse. He was so pale.
“This way, excuse me,” he said, and preceded her along

a short, narrow passage which ended in an open door leading

into a small room. There was no carpet on the floor of

the passage, and only a quite inadequate rug on the floor

of the room. The furniture was scanty and poor. There

was a table, a music stand, a cheap imitation of a Louis

Quatorze chair, two other chairs, and some piles of music.

No curtains to the window! Not a picture on the walls!

On the table a dusty disorder of small objects, including ash-trays,

and towards the back of it a little account book, open,

with a pencil on it and a low pile of coppers and a silver

ten-sou piece on the top of the coppers. Nevertheless this

interior represented a novel luxuriousness for Musa; for

previously, as Audrey knew, he had lived in one room, and

there was no bed here. The flat, indeed, actually comprised

three rooms. The account book and the pitiful heap

of coins touched her. She had expended much on the enterprise

of launching him to glory, and those coins seemed to

be all that had filtered through to him. The whole dwelling

was pathetic, and she thought of the splendours of her own

daily life, of the absolute unimportance to her of such sums

as would keep Musa in content for a year or for ten years,

and of the grandiose, majestic, dazzling career of herself and

Mr. Gilman when their respective fortunes should be joined

together. And she mysteriously saw Mr. Gilman’s face

again, and that too was pathetic. Everything was pathetic.

She alone seemed to be hard, dominating, overbearing. Her

conscience waked to fresh activity. Was she losing her

soul? Where were her ideals? Could she really work in

full honesty for the feminist cause as the wife of a man

like Mr. Gilman? He was adorable: she felt in that

moment that she had a genuine affection for him; but could

Mrs. Gilman challenge the police, retort audaciously upon

magistrates, and lie in prison? In a word, could she be a

martyr? Would Mr. Gilman, with all his amenability, consent?

Would she herself consent? Would it not be

ridiculous? Thus her flying, shamed thoughts in front of

the waiting Musa!
“Then you aren’t ill?” she began.
“Ill!” he exclaimed. “Why do you wish that I should

be ill?”
As he answered her he removed his open fiddle case, with

the violin inside it, from the Louis Quatorze chair, and

signed to her to sit down. She sat down.
“I heard that—this morning—at the rehearsal——”
“Ah! You have heard that?”
“And I thought perhaps you were ill. So I came to see.”
“What have you heard?”
“Frankly, Musa, it is said that you said you would not

play to-night.”
“Does it concern you?”
“It concerns everyone.... And you have been so

good lately.”
“Ah! I have been good lately. You have heard that.

And did you expect me to continue to be good when you

returned to Paris and passed all your days in public with

that antique and grotesque Monsieur Gilman? All the world

sees you. I myself have seen you. It is horrible.”
She controlled herself. And the fact that she was intensely

flattered helped her to do so.
“Now Musa,” she said, firmly and kindly, as on previous

occasions she had spoken to him. “Do be reasonable. I

refuse to be angry, and it is impossible for you to insult me,

however much you try. But do be reasonable. Do think

of the future. We are all wishing for your success. We

shall all be there. And now you say you aren’t going to

play. It is really too much.”
“You have perhaps bought tickets,” said Musa, and a

flush gradually spread over his cheeks. “You have perhaps

bought tickets, and you are afraid lest you have been

robbed. Tranquillise yourself, Madame. If you have the

least fear, I will instruct my agent to reimburse you. And

why should I not play? Naturally I shall play. Accept my

word, if you can.” He spoke with an icy and convincing

decision.
“Oh, I’m so glad!” Audrey murmured.
“What right have you to be glad, Madame? If you are

glad it is your own affair. Have I troubled you since we

last met? I need the sympathy of nobody. I am assured

of a large audience. My impresario is excessively optimistic.

And if this is so, I owe it to none but myself. You speak

of insults. Permit me to say that I regard your patronage

as an insult. I have done nothing, I imagine, to deserve

it. I crack my head to divine what I have done to deserve

it. You hear some silly talk about a rehearsal and you

precipitate yourself chez moi—”
Without a word Audrey rose and departed. He followed

her to the door and held it open.
“Bon jour, Madame.”
She descended the stairs. Perhaps it was his sudden

illogical change of tone; perhaps it was the memory of his

phrase, “assured of a large audience,” coupled with a

picture of the sinister Mr. Cowl unsuccessfully trying to

give away tickets—but whatever was the origin of the sob,

she did give a sob. As she walked downcast through the

courtyard she heard clearly the sounds of Musa’s violin,

played with savage vigour.

CHAPTER XLI
FINANCIAL NEWS
The Salle Xavier, or Xavier Hall, had been built, with

other people’s money, by Xavier in order to force the

general public to do something which the general public

does not want to do and never would do of its own accord.

Namely, to listen to high-class music. It had not been built,

and it was not run, strange to say, to advertise a certain

brand of piano. Xavier was an old Jew, of surpassing

ugliness, from Cracow or some such place. He looked a

rascal, and he was one—admittedly; he himself would imply

it, if not crudely admit it. He had no personal interest in

music, either high-class or low-class. But he possessed a

gift for languages and he had mixed a great deal with

musicians in an informal manner. Wagner, at Venice, had

once threatened Xavier with a stick, and also Xavier had

twice run away with great exponents of the rôle of Isolde.

His competence as a connoisseur of Wagner’s music, and

of the proper methods of rendering Wagner’s music, could

therefore not be questioned, and it was not questioned.
He had a habit of initiating grandiose schemes for opera

or concerts and of obtaining money therefor from wealthy

amateurs. After a few months he would return the money

less ten per cent. for preliminary expenses and plus his

regrets that the schemes had unhappily fallen through owing

to unforeseen difficulties. And wealthy amateurs were so

astonished to get ninety per cent. of their money back from

a rascal that they thought him almost an honest man, asked

him to dinner, and listened sympathetically to details of

his next grandiose scheme. The Xavier Hall was one of the

few schemes—and the only real estate scheme—that had

ever gone through. With the hall for a centre, Xavier laid

daily his plans and conspiracies for persuading the public

against its will. To this end he employed in large numbers

clerks, printers, bill posters, ticket agents, doorkeepers, programme

writers, programme sellers, charwomen, and even

artists. He always had some new dodge or hope. The hall

was let several times a week for concerts or other entertainments,

and many of them were private speculations of

Xavier. They were nearly all failures. And the hall,

thoroughly accustomed to seeing itself half empty, did not

pay interest on its capital. How could it? Upon occasions

there had actually been more persons in the orchestra than

in the audience. Seated in the foyer, with one eye upon a

shabby programme girl and another upon the street outside,

Xavier would sometimes refer to these facts in conversation

with a titled patron, and would describe the public

realistically and without pretence of illusion. Nevertheless,

Xavier had grown to be a rich man, for percentages were his

hourly food; he received them even from programme sellers.

At nine o’clock the hall was rather less than half full,

and this was rightly regarded as very promising, for the

management, like the management of every place of distraction

in Paris, held it a point of honour to start from twenty

to thirty minutes late—as though all Parisians had many

ages ago decided that in Paris one could not be punctual,

and that, long since tired of waiting for each other, they

had entered into a competition to make each other wait, the

individual who arrived last being universally regarded as

the winner. The members of the orchestra were filing

negligently in from the back of the vast terraced platform,

yawning, and ravaged by the fearful ennui of eternal high-class

music. They entered in dozens and scores, and they

kept on entering, and as they gazed inimically at each other,

fingering their instruments, their pale faces seemed to be

asking: “Why should it be necessary to collect so many

of us in order to prove that just one single human being

can play the violin? We can all play the violin, or something

else just as good. And we have all been geniuses in

our time.”
In strong contrast to their fatigued and disastrous indifference

was the demeanour of a considerable group of

demonstrators in the gallery. This body had crossed the

Seine from the sacred Quarter, and, not owning a wardrobe

sufficiently impressive to entitle it to ask for free seats, it

had paid for its seats. Hence naturally its seats were the

worst in the hall. But the group did not care. It was

capable of exciting itself about high-class music. Moreover

it had, for that night, an article of religious faith, to

wit, that Musa was the greatest violinist that had ever lived

or ever could live, and it was determined to prove this article

of faith by sheer force of hands and feet. Therefore it was

very happy, and just a little noisy.
In the main part of the hall the audience could be

divided into two species, one less numerous than the other.

First, the devotees of music, who went to nearly every

concert, extremely knowing, extremely blasé, extremely

disdainful and fastidious, with precise views about every

musical composition, every conductor, and every performer;

weary of melodious nights at which the same melodies were

ever heard, but addicted to them, as some people are

addicted to vices equally deleterious. These devotees would

have had trouble with their conscience or their instincts had

they not, by coming to the concert, put themselves in a

position to affirm exactly and positively what manner of a

performer Musa was. They had no hope of being pleased

by him. Indeed they knew beforehand that he was yet

another false star, but they had to ascertain the truth for

themselves, because—you see—there was a slight chance

that he might be a genuine star, in which case their careers

would have been ruined had they not been able to say to

succeeding generations: “I was at his first concert. It was

a memorable,” etc. etc. They were an emaciated tribe,

and in fact had the air of mummies temporarily revived and

escaped out of museums. They were shabby, but not with

the gallery shabbiness; they were shabby because shabbiness

was part of their unworldly refinement; and it did not

matter—they would have got their free seats even if they

had come in sacks and cerements.
The second main division of the audience—and the

larger—consisted of the jolly pleasure seekers, who had

dined well, who respected Beethoven no more than Oscar

Straus, and who demanded only one boon—not to be bored.

They had full dimpled cheeks, and they were adequately

attired, and they dropped cigarettes with reluctance in the

foyer, and they entered adventurously with marked courage,

well aware that they had come to something queer and

dangerous, something that was neither a revue nor a

musical comedy, and, while hoping optimistically for the

best, determined to march boldly out again in the event

of the worst. They had seven mortal evenings a week to

dispose of somehow, and occasionally they were obliged to

take risks. Their expressions for the most part had that

condescension which is characteristic of those who take a

risk without being paid for it.
All around the hall ran a horseshoe of private boxes,

between the balcony and the gallery. These boxes gradually

filled. At a quarter-past nine over half of them were

occupied; which fact, combined with the stylishness of the

hats in them, proved that Xavier had immense skill in

certain directions, and that on that night, for some reason

or other, he had been doing his very best.
At twenty minutes past nine the audience had coalesced

and become an entity, and the group from the Quarter was

stamping an imitation of the first bars of the C minor

Symphony, to indicate that further delay might involve

complications.
Audrey sat with Miss Ingate modestly and inconspicuously

in the fifth row of the stalls. Miss Ingate, prodigious

in crimson, was in a state of beatitude, because she

never went to concerts and imagined that she had inadvertently

slipped into heaven. The mere size of the

orchestra so overwhelmed her that she was convinced that

it was an orchestra specially enlarged to meet the unique

importance of Musa’s genius. “They must think highly of

him!” she said. She employed the time in looking about

her. She had already found, besides many other Anglo-Saxon

acquaintances, Rosamund, in black, Tommy with

Nick, and Mr. Cowl, who was one seat to Audrey’s left in

the sixth row of the stalls. Also Mr. Gilman and Madame

Piriac and Monsieur Piriac in a double box. Audrey and

herself ought to have been in that box, and had the afternoon

developed otherwise they probably would have been in that

box. Fortunately at the luncheon, Audrey, who had

bought various lots of seats, had with the strange cautiousness

of a young girl left herself free to utilise or not to

utilise the offered hospitality of Mr. Gilman’s double box,

and Mr. Gilman had not pressed her for a decision. Was

it not important that the hall should seem as full as

possible? When Miss Ingate, pushing her investigations

farther, had discovered not merely Monsieur Dauphin, but

Mr. Ziegler, late of Frinton and now resident in Paris, her

cup was full.
“It’s vehy wonderful, vehy wonderful!” said she.
But it was Audrey who most deeply had the sense of

the wonderfulness of the thing. For it was Audrey who

had created it. Having months ago comprehended that a

formal and splendid debut was necessary for Musa if he

was to succeed within a reasonable space of time, she had

willed the debut within her own brain. She alone had

thought of it. And now the realisation seemed to her to be

absolutely a miracle. Had she read of such an affair a

year earlier in a newspaper—with the words “Paris,” “tout

Paris,” “young genius,” and so on—she would have

pictured it as gloriously, thrillingly romantic, and it indeed

was gloriously and thrillingly romantic. She thought:

“None of these people sitting around me know that

I have brought it about, and that it is all mine.” The

thought was sweet. She felt like an invisible African genie

out of the Thousand and One Nights.
And yet what had she done to bring it about? Nothing,

simply nothing, except to command it! She had not even

signed cheques. Mr. Foulger had signed the cheques! Mr.

Foulger, who set down the whole enterprise as incomprehensible

lunacy! Mr. Foulger, who had never been to

aught but a smoking-concert in his life, and who could

not pronounce the name of Beethoven without hesitations!

The great deed had cost money, and it would cost more

money; it would probably cost four hundred pounds ere it

was finished with. An extravagant sum, but Xavier had

motor-cars and toys even more expensive than motor-cars

to keep up! Audrey, however, considered it a small sum,

compared to the terrific spectacular effect obtained. And

she was right. The attributes of money seemed entirely

magical to her. And she was right again. She respected

money with a new respect. And she respected herself for

using money with such large grandeur.
And withal she was most horribly nervous, just as

nervous as though it was she who was doomed to face

the indifferent and exacting audience with nothing but a

violin bow for weapon. She was so nervous that she

could not listen, could not even follow Miss Ingate’s simple

remarks; she heard them as from a long distance, and

grasped them after a long interval. Still, she was uplifted,

doughty, and proud. The humiliation of the afternoon had

vanished like a mist. Nay, she felt glad that Musa had

behaved to her just as he did behave. His mien pleased

her; his wounding words, each of which she clearly remembered,

were a source of delight. She had never

admired him so much. She had now no resentment against

him. He had proved that her hopes of him were, after all,

well justified. He would succeed. Only some silly and improbable

accident could stop him from succeeding. She

was not nervous about his success. She was nervous for

him. She became him. She tuned his fiddle, gathered

herself together and walked on to the platform, bowed to

the dim multitudinous heads in front of him, looked at the

conductor, waited for the opening bars, drew his bow

across his strings at precisely the correct second, and heard

the resulting sound under her ear. And all that before the

conductor had appeared! Such were the manifestations of

her purely personal desire for the achievement of a neat,

clean job.
“See!” said Miss Ingate. “Mr. Gilman is bowing to

us. He does look splendid, and isn’t Madame Piriac lovely?

I must say I don’t care so much for these French husbands.”
Audrey had to turn and join Miss Ingate in acknowledging

the elaborate bow. At any rate, then, Mr. Gilman had

not been utterly estranged by her capricious abandonment of

him. And why should he be? He was a man of sense;

he would understand perfectly when she explained to-morrow.

Further, he was her slave. She was sure of him. She

would apologise to him. She would richly recompense him

by smiles and honey and charming persuasive simplicity.

And he would see that with all her innocent and modest

ingenuousness she was capable of acting seriously and

effectively in a sudden crisis. She would rise higher in

his esteem. As for the foreseen proposal, well——
A sporadic clapping wakened her out of those reflections.

The conductor was approaching his desk. The orchestra

applauded him. He tapped the desk and raised his stick.

And there was a loud noise, the thumping of her heart.

The concert had begun. Musa was still invisible—what

was he doing at that instant, somewhere behind?—but the

concert had begun. Stars do not take part in the first

item of an orchestral concert. There is a convention that

they shall be preluded; and Musa was preluded by the

overture to Die Meistersinger. In the soft second section

of the overture, a most noticeable babble came from a

stage-box. “Oh! It’s the Foas,” muttered Miss Ingate.

“What a lot of people are fussing around them!” “Hsh!”

frowned Audrey, outraged by the interruption. Madame

Foa took about fifty bars in which to settle herself, and

Monsieur Foa chattered to people behind him as freely as

if he had been in a café Nobody seemed to mind.
The overture was applauded, but Madame Foa, instead

of applauding, leaned gracefully back, smiling, and waved

somebody to the seat beside her.
Violent demonstrations from the gallery!... He was

there, tripping down the stepped pathway between the

drums. The demonstrations grew general. The orchestra

applauded after its own fashion. He reached the conductor,

smiled at the conductor and bowed very admirably.

He seemed to be absolutely at his ease. Then there was

a delay. The conductor’s scores had got themselves mixed

up. It was dreadful. It was enough to make a woman

shriek.
“I say!” said a voice in Audrey’s ear. She turned as

if shot. Mr. Cowl’s round face was close to hers. “I

suppose you saw the New York Herald this morning.”
“No,” answered Audrey impatiently.
The orchestra started the Beethoven violin Concerto.

But Mr. Cowl kept his course.
“Didn’t you?” he said. “About the Zacatecas Oil

Corporation? It’s under a receivership. It’s gone smash.

I’ve had an idea for some time it would. All due to these

Mexican revolutions. I thought you might like to know.”
Musa’s bow hung firmly over the strings.

CHAPTER XLII
INTERVAL
The most sinister feature of entertainments organised by

Xavier was the intervals. Xavier laid stress on intervals;

they gave repose, and in many cases they saved money. All

Paris managers are inclined to give to the interval the

importance of a star turn, and Xavier in this respect surpassed

his rivals, though he perhaps regarded his cloak-rooms,

which were organised to cause the largest possible

amount of inconvenience to the largest possible number of

people, as his surest financial buttress. Xavier could or

would never see the close resemblance of intervals to wet

blankets, extinguishers, palls and hostile critics. The

Allegro movement of the Concerto was a real success, and

the audience as a whole would have applauded even more if

the gallery in particular had not applauded so much. The

second or Larghetto movement was also a success, but to a

less degree. As for the third and last movement, it put the

gallery into an ecstasy while leaving the floor in possession

of full critical faculties. Musa retired and had to return,

and when he returned the floor good-humouredly joined the

vociferous gallery in laudations, and he had to return again.

Then the interminable interval. Silence! Murmurings!

Silence! Creepings towards exits! And in many, very

many hearts the secret trouble question: “Why are we

here? What have we come for? What is all this pother

about art and genius? Honestly, shall we not be glad and

relieved when the solemn old thing is over?"... And

the desolating, cynical indifference of the conductor and the

orchestra! Often there is a clearer vision of the truth

during the intervals of a classical concert than on a

deathbed.
Audrey was extremely depressed in the interval after

the Beethoven Concerto and before the Lalo. But she was

not depressed by the news of the accident to the Zacatecas

Oil Corporation in which was the major part of her wealth.

The tidings had stunned rather than injured that part of her

which was capable of being affected by finance. She had

not felt the blow. Moreover she was protected by the

knowledge that she had thousands of pounds in hand and

also the Moze property intact, and further she was already

reconsidering her newly-acquired respect for money. No!

What depressed her was a doubt as to the genius of Musa.

In the long dreadful pause it seemed impossible that he

should have genius. The entire concert presented itself as

a grotesque farce, of which she as its creator ought to be

ashamed. She was ready to kill Xavier or his responsible

representative.
Then she saw the tall and calm Rosamund, with her

grey hair and black attire and her subduing self-complacency,

making a way between the rows of stalls towards

her.
“I wanted to see you,” said Rosamund, after the formal

greetings. “Very much.” Her voice was as kind and as

unrelenting as the grave.
At this point Miss Ingate ought to have yielded her

seat to the terrific Rosamund, but she failed to do so,

doubtless by inadvertence.
“Will you come into the foyer for a moment?” Rosamund

inflexibly suggested.
“Isn’t the interval nearly over?” said Audrey.
“Oh, no!”
And as a fact there was not the slightest sign of the

interval being nearly over. Audrey obediently rose. But

the invitation had been so conspicuously addressed to herself

that Miss Ingate, gathering her wits, remained in her

chair.
The foyer—decorated in the Cracovian taste—was dotted

with cigarette smokers and with those who had fled from

the interval. Rosamund did not sit down; she did not try

for seclusion in a corner. She stepped well into the foyer,

and then stood still, and absently lighted a cigarette,

omitting to offer a cigarette to Audrey. Rosamund’s air of

a deaconess made the cigarette extremely remarkable.
“I wanted to tell you about Jane Foley,” began

Rosamund quietly. “Have you heard?”
“No! What?”
“Of course you haven’t. I alone knew. She has run

away to England.”
“Run away! But she’ll be caught!”
“She may be. But that is not all. She has run away

to get married. She dared not tell me. She wrote me.

She put the letter in the manuscript of the last chapter

but one of her book, which I am revising for her. She will

almost certainly be caught if she tries to get married in

her own name. Therefore she will get married in a false

name. All this, however, is not what I wanted to tell

you about.”
“Then you shouldn’t have begun to talk about it,” said

Audrey suddenly. “Did you expect me to let you leave it

in the middle! Jane getting married! I do think she

might have told me.... What next, I wonder! I suppose

you’ve—er—lost her now?”
“Not entirely, I believe,” said Rosamund. “Certainly

not entirely. But of course I could never trust her again.

This is the worst blow I have ever had. She says—but why

go into that? Well, she does say she will work as hard

as ever, nearly; and that her future husband strongly

supports us—and so on.” Rosamund smiled with complete

detachment.
“And who’s he?” Audrey demanded.
“His name is Aguilar,” said Rosamund. “So she says.”
“Aguilar?”
“Yes. I gather—I say I gather—that he belongs to

the industrial class. But of course that is precisely the

class that Jane springs from. Odd! Is it not? Heredity,

I presume.” She raised her shoulders.
Audrey said nothing. She was too shocked to speak—not

pained or outraged, but simply shaken. What in the

name of Juno could Jane see in Aguilar? Jane, to whom

every man was the hereditary enemy! Aguilar, who had

no use for either man or woman! Aguilar, a man without

a Christian name, one of those men in connection with

whom a Christian name is impossibly ridiculous. How

should she, Audrey, address Aguilar in future? Would he

have to be asked to tea? These vital questions naturally

transcended all others in Audrey’s mind.... Still (she

veered round), it was perhaps after all just the union that

might have been expected.
“And now,” said Rosamund at length, “I have a

question to put to you.”
“Well?”
“I don’t want a definite answer here and now.” She

looked round disdainfully at the foyer. “But I do want

to set your mind on the right track at the earliest possible

moment—before any accidents occur.” She smiled

satirically. “You see how frank I am with you. I’ll be

more frank still, and tell you that I came to this concert

to-night specially to see you.”
“Did you?” Audrey murmured. “Well!”
The older woman looked down upon her from a superior

height. Her eyes were those of an autocrat. It was

quite possible to see in them the born leader who had

dominated thousands of women and played a drawn game

with the British Government itself. But Audrey, at the

very moment when she was feeling the overbearing magic

of that gaze, happened to remember the scene in Madame

Piriac’s automobile on the night of her first arrival in

Paris, when she herself was asleep and Rosamund, not

knowing that she was asleep, had been solemnly addressing

her. Miss Ingate’s often repeated account of the scene

always made her laugh, and the memory of it now caused

her to smile faintly.
“I want to suggest to you,” Rosamund proceeded,

“that you begin to work for me.”
“For the suffrage—or for you?”
“It is the same thing,” said Rosamund coldly. “I

am the suffrage. Without me the cause would not have

existed to-day.”
“Well,” said Audrey, “of course I will. I have done

a bit already, you know.”
“Yes, I know,” Rosamund admitted. “You did very

well at the Blue City. That’s why I’m approaching you.

That’s why I’ve chosen you.”
“Chosen me for what?”
“You know that a new great campaign will soon begin.

It is all arranged. It will necessitate my returning to

England and challenging the police. You know also that

Jane Foley was to have been my lieutenant-in-chief—for

the active part of the operation. You will admit that I

can no longer count on her completely. Will you take

her place?”
“I’ll help,” said Audrey. “I’ll do what I can. I dare

say I shan’t have much money, because one of those

’accidents’ you mentioned has happened to me already.”
“That need not trouble you,” replied Rosamund imperturbable.

“I have always been able to get all the

money that was needed.”
“Well, I’ll help all I can.”
“That’s not what I ask,” said Rosamund inflexibly.

“Will you take Jane Foley’s place? Will you give yourself

utterly?”
Audrey answered with sudden vehemence:
“No, I won’t. You didn’t want a definite answer, but

there it is.”
“But surely you believe in the cause?”
“Yes.”
“It’s the greatest of all causes.”
“I’m rather inclined to think it is.”
“Why not give yourself, then? You are free. I have

given myself, my child.”
“Yes,” said Audrey, who resented the appellation of

“child.” “But, you see, it’s your hobby.”
“My hobby, Mrs. Moncreiff!” exclaimed Rosamund.
“Certainly, your hobby,” Audrey persisted.
“I have sacrificed everything to it,” said Rosamund.
“Pardon me,” said Audrey. “I don’t think you’ve

sacrificed anything to it. You just enjoy bossing other

people above everything, and it gives you every chance

to boss. And you enjoy plots too, and look at the chances

you get for that’. Mind you, I like you for it. I think

you’re splendid. Only I don’t want to be a monomaniac,

and I won’t be.” Her convictions seemed to have become

suddenly clear and absolutely decided.
“Do you mean to infer that I am a monomaniac?”

asked Rosamund, raising her eyebrows—but only a little.
“Well,” said Audrey, “as you mentioned frankness—what

else would you call yourself but a monomaniac?

You only live for one thing—don’t you, now?”
“It is the greatest thing.”
“I don’t say it isn’t,” Audrey admitted. “But I’ve

been thinking a good deal about all this, and at last I’ve

come to the conclusion that one thing-isn’t enough for

me, not nearly enough. And I’m not going to be peculiar

at any price. Neither a fanatic nor a monomaniac, nor

anything like that.”
“You are in love,” asserted Rosamund.
“And what if I am? If you ask me, I think a girl

who isn’t in love ought to be somewhat ashamed of herself,

or at least sorry for herself. And I am sorry for myself,

because I am not in love. I wish I was. Why shouldn’t

I be? It must be lovely to be in love. If I was in love

I shouldn’t be only in love. You think you understand

what girls are nowadays, but you don’t. I didn’t myself

until just lately. But I’m beginning to. Girls were

supposed to be only interested in one thing—in your time.

Monomaniacs, that’s what they had to be. You changed

all that, or you’re trying to change it, but you only mean

women to be monomaniacs about something else. It isn’t

good enough. I want everything, and I’m going to get it—or

have a good try for it. I’ll never be a martyr if I can

help it. And I believe I can help it. I believe I’ve got

just enough common sense to save me from being a martyr

—either to a husband or a house or family—or a cause.

I want to have a husband and a house and a family,

and a cause too. That’ll be just about everything, won’t

it? And if you imagine I can’t look after all of them at

once, all I can say is I don’t agree with you. Because

I’ve got an idea I can. Supposing I had all these things,

I fancy I could have a tiff with my husband and make

it up, play with my children, alter a dress, change the

furniture, tackle the servants, and go out to a meeting

and perhaps have a difficulty with the police—all in one

day. Only if I did get into trouble with the police I

should pay the fine—you see. The police aren’t going to

have me altogether. Nobody is. Nobody, man or woman,

is going to be able to boast that he’s got me altogether.

You think you’re independent. But you aren’t. We girls

will show you what independence is.”
“You’re a rather surprising young creature,” observed

Rosamund with a casual air, unmoved. “You’re quite

excited.”
“Yes. I surprise myself. But these things do come

in bursts. I’ve noticed that before. They weren’t clear

when you began to talk. They’re clear now.”
“Let me tell you this,” said Rosamund. “A cause

must have martyrs.”
“I don’t see it,” Audrey protested. “I should have

thought common sense would be lots more useful than

martyrs. And monomaniacs never do have common

sense.”
“You’re very young.”
“Is that meant for an insult, or is it just a statement?”

Audrey laughed pleasantly.
And Rosamund laughed too.
“It’s just a statement,” said she.
“Well, here’s another statement,” said Audrey. “You’re

very old. That’s where I have the advantage of you.

Still, tell me what I can do in your new campaign, and

I’ll do it if I can. But there isn’t going to be any utterly

—that’s all.”
“I think the interval is over,” said Rosamund with

finality. “Perhaps we’d better adjourn.”
The foyer had nearly emptied. The distant sound of

music could be heard.
As she was re-entering the hall, Audrey met Mr. Cowl,

who was coming out.
“I have decided I can’t stand any more,” Mr. Cowl

remarked in a loud whisper. “I hope you didn’t mind

me telling you about the Zacatecas. As I said, I thought

you might be interested. Good-bye. So pleasant to have

met you again, dear lady.” His face had the same

enigmatic smile which had made him so formidable at

Moze.
Musa had already begun to play the Spanish Symphony

of Lalo, without which no genius is permitted to make

his formal debut on the violin in France.

CHAPTER XLIII
ENTR’ACTE
After the Spanish Symphony not only the conductor but

the entire orchestra followed Musa from the platform, and

Audrey understood that the previous interval had not really

been an interval and that the first genuine interval was

about to begin. The audience seemed to understand this

too, for practically the whole of it stood up and moved

towards the doors. Audrey would have stayed in her

seat, but Miss Ingate expressed a desire to go out and

“see the fun” in the foyer, and, moreover, she asserted

that the Foas from their box had been signalling to her

and Audrey an intention to meet them in the foyer. Miss

Ingate was in excellent spirits. She said it beat her how

Musa’s fingers could get through so many notes in so

short a time, and also that it made her feel tired even

to watch the fingers. She was convinced that nobody had

ever handled the violin so marvellously before. As for

success, Musa had been recalled, and the applause from

the gallery, fired by its religious belief, was obstinate and

extremely vociferous. Audrey, however, was aware of

terrible sick qualms, for she knew that Musa was not so

far dominating his public. Much of the applause had

obviously the worst quality that applause can have—it was

good-natured. Yet she could not accept failure for Musa.

Failure would be too monstrous an injustice, and therefore

it could not happen.
The emptiness of the Foas’ box indicated that Miss

Ingate might be correct in her interpretation of signals,

and Audrey allowed herself to be led away from the now

forlorn auditorium. As they filed along the gangways she

had to listen to the indifferent remarks of utterly unprejudiced

and uninterested persons about the performance

of genius, and further she had to learn that a fair proportion

of them were departing with no intention to return.

In the thronged foyer they saw Mr. Gilman, alone, before

he saw them. He was carrying a box of chocolates—doubtless

one of the little things that Mr. Price had had

instructions to provide for the evening, Mr. Gilman perhaps

would not have caught sight of them had it not been

for the stridency of Miss Ingate’s voice, which caused him

to turn round.
Audrey experienced once again the sensation—which

latterly was apt to recur in her—of having too many

matters on her mind simultaneously; in a phrase, the

sensation of the exceeding complexity of existence. And

she resented it. The interview with Rosamund was quite

enough for one night. It had been a triumph for her; she

had surprised herself in that interview; it had left her with

a conviction of freedom; it had uplifted her. She ought

to have been in a state of exaltation after that interview,

and she was. Only, while in a state of exaltation, she

was still in the old state of depression—about the tendency

of the concert, of her concert, and about the rumoured

disappearance of her fortune. Also she was preoccupied

by the very strange affair of Jane Foley and Aguilar.
And now—a further intricacy of mood—came a whole

new set of emotions due to the mere spectacle of Mr.

Gilman’s august back! She was intimidated by Mr. Gilman’s

back. She knew horribly that in the afternoon she had

treated Mr. Gilman as Mr. Gilman ought never to have

been treated. And, quite apart from intimidation, she had

another feeling, a feeling which was ghastly and of which

she was ashamed.... Assuming the disappearance of her

fortune, would Mr. Gilman’s attitude towards her be thereby

changed? ... She admitted that young girls ought not

to have such suspicions against respectable and mature

men of established position in the world. Nevertheless,

she could not blow the suspicion away.
But the instant Mr. Gilman’s eye met hers the suspicion

vanished, and not the suspicion only, but all her

intimidation. The miracle was produced by something in

the gaze of Mr. Gilman as it rested on her, something

wistful—not more definable than that, something which she

had noticed in Mr. Gilman’s gaze on other occasions. It

perfectly restored her. It gave her the positive assurance

of a fact which marvellously enheartens young girls of

about Audrey’s years—to wit, that they have a mysterious

power surpassing the power of age, knowledge, wisdom,

or wealth, that they influence and decide the course of

history, and are the sole true mistresses of the world.

Whence the mysterious power sprang she did not exactly

know, but she surmised—rightly—that it was connected

with her youth, with a dimple, with the incredibly soft

down on her cheek, with the arch softness of her glance,

with a gesture of the hand, with a turn of the shoulder,

with a pleat of the skirt.... Anyhow, she possessed it,

and to possess it was to wield it. It transformed her

into a delicious tyrant, but a tyrant; it inspired her with

exquisite cruelty, but cruelty. Her thoughts might have

been summed up in eight words:
“Pooh! He has suffered. Well, he must suffer.”
Ah! But she meant to be very kind to him. He was

so reliable, so adorable, and so dependent. She had

genuine affection for him. And he was at once a rock

and a cushion.
“Isn’t it going splendidly—splendidly, Mr. Gilman?”

exclaimed Miss Ingate in her enthusiasm.
“Apparently,” said Mr. Gilman, with comfort in his

voice.
At that moment the musical critic with large, dark

Eastern eyes, whom Audrey had met at the Foas’, strolled

nonchalantly by, and, perceiving Miss Ingate, described a

huge and perfect curve in the air with his glossy silk hat,

which had been tipped at the back of his head. Mr.

Gilman had come close to Audrey.
“The Foas started down with me,” said Mr. Gilman

mildly. “But they always meet such crowds of acquaintances

at these affairs that they seldom get anywhere.

Hortense would not leave the box. She never will.”
“Oh! I’m so glad I’ve seen you,” Audrey began

excitedly, but with simplicity and compelling sweetness.

“You’ve no idea how sorry I am about this afternoon!

I’m frightfully sorry, really! But I was so upset. I

didn’t know what to do. You know how anxious everybody

was about Musa for to-night. He’s the pet of the

Quarter, and, of course, I belong to the Quarter. At

least—I did. I thought he might be ill, or something.

However, it was all right in the end. I was looking

forward tremendously to that drive. Are you going to

forgive me?”
“Please, please!” he eagerly entreated, with a faint

blush. “Of course, I quite understand. There’s nothing

whatever to forgive.”
“Oh! but there is,” she insisted. “Only you’re so

good-natured.”
She was being magnanimous. She was pretending that

she had no mysterious power. But her motive was quite

pure. If he was good-natured, so was she. She honestly

wanted to recompense him, and to recompense him richly.

And she did. Her demeanour was enchanting in its ingenuous

flattery. She felt happy despite all her anxieties,

for he was living up to her ideal of him. She felt happy,

and her resolve to make him happy to the very limit of

his dreams was intense. She had a vision of her future

existence stretching out in front of her, and there was

not a shadow on it. She thought he was going to offer

her the box of chocolates, but he did not.
“I rather wanted to ask your advice,” she said.
“I wish you would,” he replied.
Just then the Foas arrived, and with them Dauphin,

the great and fashionable painter and the original discoverer

of Musa. And as they all began to speak at once

Audrey heard the Oriental musical critic say slowly to an

inquiring Miss Ingate:
“It is not a concert talent that he has.”
“You hear! You hear!” exclaimed Monsieur Foa to

Monsieur Dauphin and Madame Foa, with an impressed

air. “You hear what Miquette says. He has not a

concert talent. He has everything that you like, but not

a concert talent.”
Foa seemed to be exhibiting the majestic Oriental, nicknamed

Miquette, as the final arbiter, whose word settled

problems like a sword, and Miquette seemed to be trying

to bear the high rôle with negligent modesty.
“But, yes, he has! But, yes, he has!” Dauphin protested,

sweeping all Miquettes politely away. And then

there was an urbane riot of greetings, salutes, bowings,

smilings, cooings and compliments.
Dauphin was magnificent, playing the part of the

opulent painter à la mode with the most finished skill,

the most splendid richness of detail. It was notorious that

in the evenings he wore the finest silk shirts in Paris,

and his waistcoat was designed to give scope to these

shirts. He might have come—he probably had come—straight

from the bower of archduchesses; but he produced

in Audrey the illusion that archduchesses were a trifle

compared to herself. He had not seen her for a long

time. Gazing at her, he breathed relief; all his features

indicated the sudden, unexpected assuaging of eternal and

intense desires. He might have been travelling through

the desert for many days and she might have been the

oasis—the pool of living water and the palm.
“Now—like that! Just like that!” he said, holding

her hand and, as it were, hypnotising her in the pose in

which she happened to be. He looked hard at her.

“It is unique. Madame, where did you find that

dress?”
“Callot,” answered Audrey submissively.
“I thought so. Well, Madame, I can wait no more.

I will wait no more. It is Dauphin who implores you to

come to his studio. To come—it is your duty. Madame

Foa, you will bring her. I count on you absolutely to

bring her. Even if it is only to be a sketch—the merest

hint. But I must do it.”
“Oh, yes, Madame,” said Madame Foa with all the

Italian charm. “Dauphin must paint you. The contrary

is unthinkable. My husband and I have often said so.”
“To-morrow?” Dauphin suggested.
“Ah! To-morrow, my little Dauphin, I cannot,” said

Madame Foa.
“Nor I,” said Audrey.
“The day after to-morrow, then. I will send my auto.

What address? Half-past eleven. That goes? In any

case, I insist. Be kind! Be kind!”
Audrey blushed. Half the foyer was staring at the

group. She was flattered. She saw herself remarkable.

She thought she would look more particularly, with perfect

detachment, at the mirror that night, in order to decide

whether her appearance was as striking, as original, as

distinguished, as Dauphin’s attitude implied. There must

surely be something in it.
“About that advice—may I call to-morrow?” It was

Mr. Gilman’s voice at her elbow.
“Advice?” She had forgotten her announced intention

of asking his advice. (The subject was to be Zacatecas.)

“Oh, yes. How nice of you! Please do call. Come for

tea.” She was delightful to him, but at the same time

there was in her tone a little of the condescending casualness

proper to the tone of a girl openly admired by the

confidant and painter of princesses and archduchesses, the

man who treated all plain women and women past the

prime with a desolating indifference.
She thought:
“I am a rotten little snob.”
Mr. Gilman gave thanksgivings and departed, explaining

that he must return to Madame Piriac.
Foa and Dauphin and the Oriental resumed the argument

about Musa’s talent and the concert. Miquette would say

nothing as to the success of the concert. Foa asserted

that the concert was not and would not be a success.

Dauphin pooh-poohed and insisted vehemently that the

success was unmistakable and increasing. Moreover, he

criticised the hall, the choice of programme, the orchestra,

the conductor. “I discovered Musa,” said he. “I have

always said that he is a great concert player, and that

he is destined for a great world-success, and to-night I

am more sure of it than ever.” Whereupon Madame Foa

said with much sympathy that she hoped it was so, and

Foa said: “You create illusions for yourself, on purpose.”

Dauphin bore him down with wavy gestures and warm

cries of “No! No! No!” And he appealed to Audrey

as-a woman incapable of illusions. And Audrey agreed

with Dauphin. And while she was agreeing she kept

saying to herself: “Why do I pretend to agree with him?

He is not sincere. He knows he is not sincere. We all

know—except perhaps Winnie Ingate. The concert is a

failure. If it were not a failure, Madame Foa would not

be so sympathetic. She is more subtle even than Madame

Piriac. I shall never be subtle like that. I wish I could

be. I wish I was at Moze. I am too Essex for all this.

And Winnie here is too comic for words.”
An aged and repellent Jew came into sight. He raised

Madame Foa’s hand to his odious lips and kissed it, and

Audrey wondered how Madame Foa could tolerate the

formality.
“Well, Monsieur Xavier?”
Xavier shrugged his round shoulders.
“Do not say,” said he, in a hoarse voice to the company,

“do not say that I have not done my best on this occasion.”

He lifted his eyes heavenward, and as he did so his passing

glance embraced Audrey, and she violently hated him.
“Winnie,” said she, “I think we ought to be getting

back to our seats.”
“But,” cried Madame Foa, “we are going round with

Dauphin to the artists’ room. You do not come with us,

Madame Moncreiff?”
“In your place ...” muttered Xavier discouragingly,

with a look at Dauphin, and another shrug of the shoulders.

“I have been ...”
“Ah!” said Dauphin, in a strange new tone. And then

very brightly to Audrey: “Now, as to Saturday, dear

lady——”
Xavier engaged in private converse with Foa, and his

demeanour to Foa was extremely deferential, whereas he

almost ignored the Oriental critic. And Audrey puzzled her

head once again to discover why the Foas should exert such

influence upon the fate of music in Paris. The enigma was

only one among many.

CHAPTER XLIV
END OF THE CONCERT
The first item after the true interval was the Chaconne of

Bach, which Musa had played upon a memorable occasion

in Frinton. He stood upon the platform utterly alone,

against a background of empty chairs, double-basses and

drums. He seemed to be unfriended and forlorn. It

appeared to Audrey that he was playing with despair. She

wished, as she looked from Musa to the deserted places in

the body of the hall, that the piece was over, and that the

entire concert was over. How could anyone enjoy such

an arid maze of sounds? The whole theory of classical

composition and its vogue was hollow and ridiculous.

People did not like the classics; they could not and they

never would. Now a waltz ... after a jolly dinner and

wine! ... But the Chaconne! But Bach! But culture!

The audience was visibly and audibly restless. For about

two hundred years the attempt to force this Chaconne upon

the public had been continuous, and it was still boring them.

Of course it was! The thing was unnatural.
And she herself was a fool; she was a ninny. And the

alleged power of money was an immense fraud. She had

thought to perform miracles by means of a banking account.

For a moment she had imagined that the miracles had come

to pass. But they had not come to pass. The public was

too old, too tired, and too wary. It could not thus be

tricked into making a reputation. The forces that made

reputations were far less amenable than she had fancied.

The world was too clever and too experienced for her ingenuous

self. Geniuses were not lying about and waiting

to be picked up. Musa was not a genius. She had been a

simpleton, and the sacred Quarter had been a simpleton.

She was rather angry with Musa for not being a genius.

And the confidence which he had displayed a few hours

earlier was just grotesque conceit! And men and women

who were supposed to be friendly human hearts were not

so in truth. They were merely indifferent and callous spectators.

The Foas, for example, were chattering in their

box, apparently oblivious of the tragedy that was enacting

under their eyes. But then, it was perhaps not a tragedy;

it was perhaps a farce.
And what would these self-absorbed spectators of existence

say and do, if and when it was known that she was

no longer a young woman of enormous wealth? Would

Dauphin have sought to compel her to enter his studio had

he been aware that her fortune had gone tip in smoke?

She was not in a real world. She was in a world of shams.

And she was a sham in the world of shams. She wanted

to be back again in the honest realities of Moze, where in

the churchyard she could see the tombs of her great-great-grandfathers.

Only one extraneous interest drew her

thoughts away from Moze. That interest was Mr. Gilman.

Mr. Gilman was her conquest and her slave. She adored

him because he was so wistful and so reliable and so

adoring. Mr. Gilman sat intent and straight upright in

Madame Piriac’s box and behaved just as though Bach

himself was present. He understood nothing of Bach, but

he could be trusted to behave with benevolence.
The music suddenly ceased. The Chaconne was finished.

The gallery of enthusiasts still applauded with vociferation,

with mystic faith, with sublime obstinacy. It was carrying

on a sort of religious war against the base apathy of the

rest of the audience. It was determined to force its belief

down the throats of the unintelligent mob. It had made

up its mind that until it had had its way the world should

stand still. No encore had yet been obtained, and the

gallery was set on an encore. The clapping fainted, expired,

and then broke into new life, only to expire again

and recommence. A few irritated persons hissed. The

gallery responded with vigour. Musa, having retired, reappeared,

very white, and bowed. The applause was

feverish and unconvincing. Musa vanished. But the

gallery had thick soles and hard hands and stout sticks,

even serviceable umbrellas. It could not be appeased by

bows alone. And after about three minutes of tedious

manoeuvring, Musa had at last to yield an encore that in

fact nobody wanted. He played a foolish pyrotechnical

affair of De Bériot, which resembled nothing so much as a

joke at a funeral. After that the fate of the concert could

not be disputed even by the gallery. At the finish of the

evening there was, in the terrible idiom of the theatre,

“not a hand.”
Whether Musa had played well or ill, Audrey had not

the least idea. Nor did that point seem to matter. Naught

but the attitude of the public seemed to matter. This was

strange, because for a year Audrey had been learning steadily

in the Quarter that the attitude of the public had no importance

whatever. She suffered from the delusion that

the public was staring at her and saying to her: “You, you

silly little thing, are responsible for this fiasco. We condescended

to come—and this is what you have offered us.

Go home, and let your hair down and shorten your skirts,

for you are no better than a schoolgirl, after all.” She

was really self-conscious. She despised Musa, or rather

she threw to him a little condescending pity. And yet at

the same time she was furious against that group in the

foyer for being so easily dissuaded from going to see Musa

in the artists’ room.... Rats deserting a sinking ship!...

People, even the nicest, would drop a failure like a

match that was burning out.... Yes, and they would

drop her.... No, they would not, because of Mr. Gilman.

Mr. Gilman was calling-to see her to-morrow. He was

the rock and the cushion. She would send Miss Ingate

out for the afternoon. As the audience hurried eagerly

forth she spoke sharply to Miss Ingate. She was indeed

very rude to Miss Ingate. She was exasperated, and Miss

Ingate happened to be handy.
In the foyer not a trace of the Foa clan nor of Madame

Piriac and her husband, nor of Mr. Gilman! But Tommy

and Nick were there, putting on their cloaks, and with

them, but not helping them, was Mr. Ziegler. The blond

Mr. Ziegler greeted Audrey as though the occasion of their

previous meeting had been a triumph for him. His self-satisfaction,

if ever it had been damaged, was repaired to

perfection. The girls were silent; Miss Ingate was silent;

but Mr. Ziegler was not silent.
“He played better than I did anticipate,” said Mr.

Ziegler, lighting a cigarette, after he had nonchalantly

acknowledged the presentation to him of Miss Ingate.

“But of what use is this French public? None. Even had

he succeeded here it would have meant nothing. Nothing.

In music Paris does not exist. There are six towns in

Germany where success means vorldt-reputation. Not that

he would succeed in Germany. He has not studied in Germany.

And outside Germany there are no schools. However,

we have the intention to impose our culture upon all

European nations, including France. In one year our army

will be here—in Paris. I should wait for that, but probably

I shall be called up. In any case, I shall be present.”
“But whatever do you mean?” cried Miss Ingate,

aghast.
“What do I mean? I mean our army will be here.

All know it in Germany. They know it in Paris! But what

can they do? How can they stop us?... Decadent!...”

He laughed easily.
“Oh, my chocolates!” exclaimed Miss Thompkins.

“I’ve left them in the hall!”
“No, here they are,” said Nick, handing the box.
To Audrey it seemed to be the identical box that Mr.

Gilman had been carrying. But of course it might not be.

Thousands of chocolate boxes resemble each other exactly.
Carefully ignoring Mr. Ziegler, Audrey remarked to

Tommy with a light-heartedness which she did not feel:
“Well, what did you think of Jane this afternoon?”
“Jane?”
“Jane Foley. Nick was taking you to see her, wasn’t

she?”
“Oh, yes!” said Tommy with a bright smile. “But I

didn’t go. I went for a motor drive with Mr. Gilman.”
There was a short pause. At length Tommy said:
“So he’s got the goods on you at last!”
“Who?” Audrey sharply questioned.
“Dauphin. I knew he would. Remember my words.

That portrait will cost you forty thousand francs, not

counting the frame.”
This was the end of the concert.

CHAPTER XLV
STRANGE RESULT OF A QUARREL
The next afternoon Audrey sat nervous and expectant, but

highly finished, in her drawing-room at the Hôtel du

Danube. Miss Ingate had gone out, pretending to be

quite unaware that she had been sent out. The more detailed

part of Audrey’s toilette had been accomplished

subsequent to Miss Ingate’s departure, for Audrey had

been at pains to inform Miss Ingate that she, Audrey, was

even less interested than usual in her appearance that afternoon.

They were close and mutually reliable friends; but

every friendship has its reservations. Elise also was out;

indeed, Miss Ingate had taken her.
Audrey had the weight of all the world on her, and so

long as she was alone she permitted herself to look as

though she had. She had to be wise, not only for Audrey

Moze, but for others. She had to be wise for Musa, whose

failure, though the newspapers all spoke (at about twenty

francs a line) of his overwhelming success, was admittedly

lamentable; and she hated Musa; she confessed that she had

been terribly mistaken in Musa, both as an artist and as a

man; still, he was on her mind. She had to be wise about

her share in the new campaign of Rosamund, which, while

not on her mind, was on her conscience. She had to be

wise about the presumable loss of her fortune; she had

telegraphed to Mr. Foulger early that morning for information,

and an answer was now due. Finally she had to be

wise for Mr. Gilman, whose happiness depended on a tone

of her voice, on a single monosyllable breathed through those

rich lips. She looked forward with interest to being wise

for Mr. Gilman. She felt capable of that. The other

necessary wisdoms troubled her brow. She seemed to be

more full of responsibility and sagacity than any human

being could have been expected to be. She was, however,

very calm. Her calmness was prodigious.
Then the bell rang, and she could hear one of the hotel

attendants open the outer door with his key. Instantly her

calmness, of which she had been so proud, was dashed to

pieces and she had scarcely begun in a hurry to pick the

pieces up and put them together again when the attendant

entered the drawing-room. She was afraid, but she thought

she was happy.
Only it was not Mr. Gilman the attendant announced.

The man said:
“Mademoiselle Nickall.”
Audrey said to herself that she must get Nick very

quickly away. She was in no humour to talk even to Nick,

and, moreover, she did not want Nick to know that Mr.

Gilman was calling upon her.
Miss Nickall was innocent and sweet. Good nature

radiated from her soft, tired features, and was somehow

also entangled in her fluffy grey hair. She kissed Audrey

with affection.
“I’ve just come to say good-bye, you dear!” she said,

sitting down and putting her check parasol across her knees.

“How lovely you look!”
“Good-bye?” Audrey questioned. “Do I?”
“I have to cross for England to-night. I’ve had my

orders. Rosamund came this morning. What about yours?”
“Oh!” said Audrey. “I don’t take orders. But I

expect I shall join in, one of these days, when I’ve had

everything explained to me properly. You see, you and I

haven’t got the same tastes, Nick. You aren’t happy

without a martyrdom. I am.”
Nick smiled gravely and uncertainly.
“It’s very serious this time,” said she. “Hasn’t

Rosamund spoken to you yet?”
“She’s spoken to me. And I’ve spoken to her. It was

deuce, I should say. Or perhaps my ’vantage. Anyhow,

I’m not moving just yet.”
“Well, then,” said Nick, “if you’re staying in Paris, I

hope you’ll keep an eye on Musa. He needs it. Tommy’s

going away. At least I fancy she is. We both went to

see him this morning.”
“Both of you!”
“Well, you see, we’ve always looked after him. He

was in a terrible state about last night. That’s really one

reason why I called. Not that I’d have gone without

kissing you——”
She stopped. There was another ring at the bell. The

attendant came in with great rapidity.
“I’m lost!” thought Audrey, disgusted and perturbed.

“Her being here will spoil everything.”
But the attendant handed her a card, and the card bore

the name of Musa. Audrey flushed. Almost instinctively,

without thinking, she passed the card to Nick.
“My land!” exclaimed Nick. “If he sees me here he’ll

think I’ve come on purpose to talk about him and pity him,

and he’ll be just perfectly furious. Can I get out any other

way?” She glanced interrogatively at the half-open door

of the bedroom.
“But I don’t want to see him, either!” Audrey protested.
“Oh! You must! He’ll listen to sense from you,

perhaps. Can I go this way?”
Impelled to act in spite of herself, Audrey took Nick

into the bedroom, and as soon as Musa had been introduced

into the drawing-room she embraced Nick in silence

and escorted her on tiptoe through Miss Ingate’s bedroom

to the vestibule and waved an adieu. Then she retraced her

steps and made a grand entry into the drawing-room from

her own bedroom. She meant to dispose of Musa immediately.

A meeting between him and Mr. Gilman on her

hearthrug might involve the most horrible complications.
The young man and the young woman shook hands.

But it was the handshaking of bruisers when they enter the

ring, and before the blood starts to flow.
“Won’t you please sit down?” said Audrey. He was

obliged now to obey her, as she had been obliged to obey

him on the previous afternoon in the Rue Cassette.
If Audrey looked as though the whole world was on her

shoulders, Musa’s face seemed to contradict hers and to say

that the world, far from being on anybody’s shoulders, had

come to an end. All the expression of the violinist showed

that in his honest conviction a great mundane calamity had

occurred, the calamity of course being that his violin bow

had not caused catgut to vibrate in such a way as to affect

the ears of a particular set of people in a particular manner.

But in addition to this sense of a calamity he was under

the influence of another emotion—angry resentment. However,

he sat down, holding firmly his hat, gloves, and stick.
“I saw my agent this morning,” said he, in a grating

voice, in French. He was pale.
“Yes?” said Audrey. She suddenly guessed what was

coming, and she felt a certain alarm, which nevertheless

was not entirely disagreeable.
“Why did you pay for that concert, and the future

concerts, without telling me, Madame?”
“Paid for the concerts?” she repeated, rather weakly.
“Yes, Madame. To do so was to make me ridiculous—not

to the world, but to myself. For I believed all the

time that I had succeeded in gaining the genuine interest

of an agent who was prepared to risk money upon the

proper exploitation of my talent. I worked in that belief.

In spite of your attitude to me I did work. Your antipathy

was bad for me; but I conquered myself, and I worked. I

had confidence in myself. If last night I did not have a

triumph, it was not because I did not work, but because I

had been upset—and again by you, Madame. Even after

the misfortune of last night I still had confidence, for I

knew that the reasons of my failure were accidental and

temporary. But I now know that I was living in a fool’s

paradise, which you had kindly created for me. You have

money. Apparently you have too much money. And with

money you possess the arrogance of wealth. You knew that

I had accepted assistance from good friends. And you

thought in your arrogance that you might launch me without

informing me of your intention. You thought it would

amuse you to make a little fairy-tale in real life. It was a

negligent gesture on the part of a rich and idle woman. It

cost you nothing save a few bank-notes, of which you had

so many that it bored you to count them. How amusing to

make a reputation! How charitable to help a starving

player! But you forgot one thing. You forgot my dignity

and my honour. It was nothing to you that you exposed

these to the danger of the most grave affront. It was

nothing to you that I was received just as though I had

been a child, and that for months I was made, without knowing

it, to fulfil the rôle of a conceited jackanapes. When

one is led to have confidence in oneself one is tempted to

adopt a certain tone and to use certain phrases, which may

or may not be justified. I yielded to the temptation. I

was wrong, but I was also victimised. This morning, with

a moment’s torture under the impertinent tongue of a

rascally impresario, I paid for all the spurious confidence

which I have felt and for all the proud words I have uttered.

I came to-day in order to lay at your feet my thanks for the

unique humiliation which I owe to you.”
His mien was undoubtedly splendid. It ought to have

cowed and shamed Audrey. But it did not. She absolutely

refused to acknowledge, even within her own heart, that

she had committed any wrong. On the contrary, she

remembered all the secret sympathy which she had lavished

on Musa, all her very earnest and single-minded desires

for his apotheosis at the hands of the Parisian public;

and his ingratitude positively exasperated her. She was

aroused. But she tried to hide the fact that she was

roused, speaking in a guarded and sardonic voice.
“And did this agent of yours—I do not know his name—tell

you that I was paying for the concert—I mean, the

concerts?” she demanded with an air of impassivity.

“He did not give your name.”
“That’s something,” Audrey put in, her body trembling.

“I am much obliged to him.”
“But he clearly indicated that money had been paid—that

he had not paid it himself—that the enterprise was

not genuine. He permitted himself to sneer until I corrected

him. He then withdrew what he had said and

told me that I had misunderstood. But he was not convincing.

It was too late. And I had not misunderstood.

Far from that, I had understood. At once the truth

traversed my mind like a flash of lightning. It was you

who had paid.”
“And how did you guess that?” She laughed carelessly,

though she could not keep her foot from shaking

on the carpet.
“I knew because I knew!” cried Musa. “It explained

all your conduct, your ways of speaking to me, your

attitude of a schoolmistress, everything. How ingenuous

I have been not to perceive it before!”
“Well,” said Audrey firmly. “You are wrong. It is

absolutely untrue that I have ever paid a penny, or ever

shall, to any agent on your behalf. Do you hear? Why

should I, indeed! And now what have you to reply?”
She was aware of not the slightest remorse for this

enormous and unqualified lie. Nay, she held it was not

a lie, because Musa deserved to hear it. Strange logic,

but her logic! And she was much uplifted and enfevered,

and grandly careless of all consequences.
“You are a woman,” said Musa curtly and obstinately.
“That, at any rate, is true.”
“Therefore I cannot treat you as a man.”
“Please do,” she said, rising.
“No. If you were a man I should call you out.” And

Musa rose also. “And I should be right. As you are

a woman I have told you the truth, and I can do no

more. I shall not characterise your denial. I have no

taste for recrimination. Besides, in such a game, no man

can be the equal of a woman. But I maintain what I

have said, and I affirm that I know it to be true, and

that there is no excuse for your conduct. And so I

respectfully take leave.” He moved towards the door and

then stopped. “There never had been any excuse for

your conduct to me,” he added. “It has always been

the conduct of a rich and capricious woman who amused

herself by patronising a poor artist.”
“You may be interested to know,” she said fiercely,

“that I am no longer rich. Last night I heard that

my fortune is gone. If I have amused myself, that may

amuse you.”
“It does amuse me,” he retorted grimly and more

loudly. “I wish that you had never possessed a son.

For then I might have been spared many mournful hours.

All would have been different. Yes! From three days

ago when I saw you walking intimately in the Tuileries

Gardens with the unspeakable Gilman—right back to last

year when you first, from caprice, did your best to make

me love you—did it deliberately, so that all the Quarter

could see!”
In a furious temper Audrey rushed past Musa to the

door, and stood with her back to it, palpitating. She

vaguely recalled a similar movement of hers long ago, and

the slightly comic figure of Mr. Foulger flitted through

her memory.
“You shall apologise for that! You shall apologise

before you leave this room!” she exploded. Her chin

was aloft and her mouth remained open. “I say you

shall apologise for that monstrous untruth!”
He approached her, uttering not a word. She was

quite ready to kill him. She had no fear of anything

whatever. Not once since his arrival had she given one

thought to the imminent advent of Mr. Gilman.
She said to herself, watching Musa intently:
“Yes, he shall apologise. It is shameful, what he says.

It’s worse than horrid. I am as strong as he is.”
Musa dropped his hat, stick and gloves. The hat,

being English and hard, bounced on the carpet. Then he

put his trembling arms around her waist, and his trembling

lips came nearer and nearer to hers.
She thought, very puzzled:
“What is happening? This is all wrong. I am furious

with him! I will never speak to him again! What is

he doing? This is all wrong. I must stop it. I’m saying

nothing to him about my career, and my independence,

and how horrid it is to be the wife of a genius, and all

that.... I must stop it.”
But she had no volition to stop it.
She thought:
“Am I fainting?”

It was upon this scene that Mr. Gilman intruded.

Mr. Gilman looked from one to the other. Perhaps the

thought in his mind was that if they added their ages

together they could not equal his age. Perhaps it was

not. He continued to look from one to the other, and

this needed some ocular effort, for they were as far apart

as two persons in such a situation usually get when they

are surprised. Then he caught sight of the hat, stick and

gloves on the floor.
“I’ve been expecting you for a long time,” said Audrey,

with that miraculous bland tranquillity of which young

girls alone have the secret when the conventions are

imperilled. “I was just going to order tea.”
Mr. Gilman hesitated and then replied:
“How kind of you! But please don’t order tea for

me. The—er—fact is, I have been unexpectedly called

away, and I only called to explain that—er—I could not

call.” After all, he was a man of some experience.
She let him go. His demeanour to Musa, like Musa’s

to him, was a marvel of high courtesy.
“Musa,” said Audrey, with an intimidated, defiant, proud

smile, when the door had shut on Mr. Gilman, “I am

still frightfully angry with you. If we stay here I shall

suffocate. Let us go out for a walk. Besides, other

people might call.”
Simultaneously there was another ring. It was a cable.

She read:
“Sold Zacatecas at an average of six and a quarter

dollars three weeks ago. Wrote you at length to Wimereux.

Writing again as to new investments.
“FOULGER.”
“This comes of having no fixed address,” she said,

throwing the blue cablegram carelessly down in front of

Musa. “I’m not quite ruined, after all. But I might have

known—with Mr. Foulger.” Then she explained.
“I wish——” he began.
“No, you don’t,” she stopped him. “So you needn’t

start on that line. You are brilliant at figures. At least

I long since suspected you were. How much is one hundred

and eighty thousand times six and a quarter?”
Notwithstanding his brilliance, it took two pencils, two

heads, and one piece of paper to solve the problem. They

were not quite certain, but the answer seemed to be

£225,000 in English money.
“We cannot starve,” said Audrey, and then paused....

“Musa, are we friends? We shall quarrel horribly.

Do you know, I never knew that proposals of marriage

were made like that!”
“I have not told you one thing,” said Musa. “I am

going to play in Germany, instead of further concerts in

Paris. It is arranged.”
“Not in Germany,” she pleaded, thinking of Ziegler.
“Yes, in Germany,” said Musa masterfully. “I have

a reputation to make. It is the agent who has suggested

it.”
“But the concerts in London?”
“You are English. I wish not to wound you.”
When Audrey stood up again, she had to look at the

floor in order to make sure that it was there. Once

she had tasted absinthe. She had had to take the same

precaution then.
“Stop! I entreat thee!” said Musa suddenly, just

as, all arrayed in her finery, she was opening the door

for the walk.
“What is it?”
He kissed her, and with his lips almost on hers he

murmured:
“Thou shalt not go out without avowing. And if thou

art angry—well, I adore thy anger. The concerts were ...

thy enterprise? I guessed well?”
“You see,” she replied like a shot, “you weren’t sure,

although you pretended you were.”
In the Rue de Rivoli, and in the resplendent Champs

Elysées they passed column after column of entertainment

posters. But the name of Musa had been mysteriously

removed from all of them.

CHAPTER XLVI
AN EPILOGUE
Audrey was walking along Piccadilly when she overtook

Miss Ingate, who had been arrested by a shop window,

the window of one of the shops recently included in the

vast edifice of the Hotel Majestic.
Miss Ingate gave a little squeal of surprise. The two

kissed very heartily in the street, which was full of spring

and of the posters of evening papers bearing melodramatic

tidings of the latest nocturnal development of the terrible

suffragette campaign.
“You said eleven, Audrey. It isn’t eleven yet.”
“Well, I’m behind time. I meant to be all spruced

up and receive you in state at the hotel. But the boat

was three hours late at Harwich. I jumped into a cab

at Liverpool Street, but I got out at Piccadilly Circus

because the streets looked so fine and I felt I really must

walk a bit.”
“And where’s your husband?”
“He’s at Liverpool Street trying to look after the

luggage. He lost some of it at Hamburg. He likes

looking after luggage, so I just left him at it.”
Miss Ingate’s lower lip dropped at the corners.
“You’ve had a tiff.”
“Winnie, we haven’t.”
“Did you go to all his concerts?”
“All. I heard all his practising, and I sat in the

stalls at all his concerts. Quite contrary to my principles,

of course. But, Winnie, it’s very queer, I wanted to

do it. So naturally I did it. We’ve never been apart—until

now.”
“And it’s not exaggerated, what you’ve written me

about his success?”
“Not a bit. I’ve been most careful not to exaggerate.

In fact, I’ve tried to be gloomy. No use, however! It

was a triumph.... And how’s all this business?” Audrey

demanded, in a new key, indicating an orange-tinted newspaper

bill that was being flaunted in front of her.
“Oh! I believe it’s dreadful. Of course, you know

Rosamund’s in prison. But they’ll have to let her out

soon. Jane Foley—she still calls herself Foley—hasn’t

been caught. And that’s funny. I doubled my subscription.

We had to, you see. But that’s all I’ve done. They don’t

have processions and things now, and barrel organs are

quite out of fashion. What with that, and my rheumatism!...

I used to think I should live to vote myself. I feel

I shan’t now. So I’ve gone back into water-colours.

They’re very soothing, if you let the paper dry after each

wash and don’t take them seriously.... Now, I’m a

very common-sense woman, Audrey, as you must have

noticed, and I’m not subject to fancies. Will you just

look at the girl on the left hand in this window here, and

tell me whether I’m dreaming or not?”
Miss Ingate indicated the shop window which had

arrested her. The establishment was that of a hair

specialist, and the window was mainly occupied by two

girls who sat in arm-chairs with their backs to the glass,

and all their magnificent hair spread out at length over

the backs of the chairs for the inspection of the public;

the implication being that the magnificent hair was due

to the specific of the hair specialist. Passers-by continually

stopped to gaze at the spectacle, but they never stopped

long, because the spectacle was monotonous.
“Well, what about her?” said Audrey, staring.
“Isn’t it Lady Southminster?”
“Good heavens!” Audrey’s mind went back to the

Channel packet and the rain squall and the scenes on the

Paris train. “So it is! Whatever can have happened to

her? Let’s go in.”
And in they went, Audrey leading, and demanding at

once a bottle of the specific; Audrey had scarcely spoken

when the left-hand girl in the window, who, of course,

from her vantage had a full view of the shop, screamed

lightly and jumped down from the window.
“Don’t give me away!” she whispered appealingly in

Audrey’s ear. The next moment, not heeding the excitement

of the shop manager, she had drawn Audrey and

Miss Ingate through another door which led into the

entrance-hall of the Majestic Hotel. The shop was thus

contrived to catch two publics at once.
“If they knew I was Lady Southminster in there,”

said Lady Southminster in a feverish murmur—she seemed

not averse to the sensation caused by her hair in the

twilight of the hotel—“I expect I should lose my place,

and I don’t want to lose it. He’ll be coming by presently,

and he’ll see me, and it’ll be a lesson to him. We’re

always together. Race meetings, dances, golf, restaurants,

bridge. Twenty-four hours every day. He won’t lose

sight of me. He’s that fond of me, you know. I couldn’t

stand it. I’d as lief be in prison—only I’m that fond of

him, you know. But I was so homesick, and I felt if I

didn’t have a change I should burst. This is Constantinopoulos’s

old shop, you know, where I used to make

cigarettes in the window. He’s dead, Constantinopoulos is.

I don’t know what he’d have said to hair restorers. I

asked for the place, and I showed ’em my hair, and I

got it. And me sitting there—it’s quite like old times.

Only before, you know, I used to have my face to the

street. I don’t know which I like best. But, anyhow,

you can see my profile from the side window. And he

will. He always looks at that sort of thing. He’ll be

furious. But it will do him no end of good. Well,

good-bye. But come back in and buy a bottle, or I shall

be let in for a shindy. In fact, you might buy two

bottles.”
“So that’s love!” said Audrey when the transaction

was over and they were in the entrance-hall again.
“No,” said Miss Ingate. “That’s marriage. And don’t

you forget it.... Hallo, Tommy!”
“You’d better not let Mr. Gilman hear me called

Tommy in this hotel,” laughed Miss Thompkins, who was

attired with an unusual richness, as she advanced towards

Miss Ingate and Audrey. “And what are you doing

here?” she questioned Audrey.
“I’m staying here,” said Audrey. “But I’ve only just

arrived. I’m advance agent for my husband. How are

you? And what are you doing here? I thought you hated

London.”
“I came the day before yesterday,” Tommy replied.

“And I’m very fit. You see, Mr. Gilman preferred us

to be married in London. And I’d no objection. So

here I am. The wedding’s to-morrow. You aren’t very

startled, are you? Had you heard?”
“Well,” said Audrey, “not what you’d call ‘heard.’

But I’d a sort of a kind of a—”
“You come right over here, young woman.”
“But I want to get my number.”
“You come right over here right now,” Tommy insisted.

And in another corner of the entrance-hall she

spoke thus, and there was both seriousness and fun in

her voice: “Don’t you run away with the idea that I’m

taking your leavings, young woman. Because I’m not.

We all knew you’d lost your head about Musa, and it

was quite right of you. But you never had a chance

with Ernest, though you thought you had, after I’d met

him. Admit I’m much better suited for him than you’d

have been. I’d only one difficulty, and that was the nice

boy Price, who wanted to drown himself for my beautiful

freckled face. That’s all. Now you can go and get your

number.”
The incident might not have ended there had not

Madame Piriac appeared in the entrance-hall out of the

interior of the hotel.
“He exacted my coming,” said Madame Piriac privately

to Audrey. “You know how he is strange. He asks for

a quiet wedding, but at the same time it must be all that

is most correct. There are things, he says, which demand

a woman.... I know four times nothing of the English

etiquette. I have abandoned my husband. And here I

am. Voilà! Listen. She has great skill with him, cette

Tommy. Nevertheless, I have the intention to counsel her

about her complexion. Impossible to keep any man with a

complexion like hers!”
They saw Mr. Gilman himself enter the hotel. He

was very nervous and very important. As soon as he

caught sight of Miss Thompkins he said to the door-keeper:
“Tell my chauffeur to wait.”
He was punctiliously attentive to Miss Thompkins, and

held her hand for two seconds after he had practically

finished with it.
“Are you ready, dear?” he said. “You’ll be sorry

to hear that my liver is all wrong again. I knew it was

because I slept so heavily.”
These words were distinctly heard by Audrey herself.
“I think I’ll slip upstairs now,” she murmured to

Madame Piriac. And vanished, before Mr. Gilman had

observed her presence.
She thought:
“How he has aged!”
Scarcely ten minutes later, when Audrey was upstairs

in her sitting-room, waiting idly for the luggage and her

husband to arrive, and thinking upon the case of Lady

Southminster, the telephone bell rang out startlingly.
“Mr. Shinner to see you.”
“Mr. Shinner? Oh! Mr. Shinner. Send him up,

please.”
This Mr. Shinner was the concert agent with connections

in Paris whom Audrey had first consulted in the

enterprise of launching Musa upon the French public. He

was a large, dark man, black moustached and bearded,

with heavy limbs and features, and an opaque, pimpled

skin. In spite of these characteristics, he entered the

room soft-footed as a fairy, ingratiating as a dog aware

of his own iniquity, reassuring as applause.
“Well, Mr. Shinner. But how did you know we were

here? As a matter of fact we aren’t here. My husband

has not arrived yet.”
“Madam,” said Mr. Shinner, “I happened to hear that

you had telegraphed for rooms, and as I was in the neighbourhood

I thought I would venture to call.”
“But who told you we had telegraphed for rooms?”
“The manager is a good friend of mine, and as you

are now famous——” Ah! I have heard all about the German

tour. I mean I have read about it. I subscribe to the

German musical papers. One must, in my profession. Also

I have had direct news from my correspondents in Germany.

It was a triumph there, was it not?”
“Yes,” said Audrey. “After Dusseldorf. My husband

did not make much money——”
“That will not trouble you,” Mr. Shinner smiled easily.
“But somebody did—the agents did.”
“Perhaps not so much as you think, madam, if I may

say so. Perhaps not so much as you think. And we must

all live—unfortunately. Has your husband made any

arrangements yet for London or for a provincial tour? I

have reason to think that the season will be particularly

brilliant. And I can now offer advantages——”
“But, Mr. Shinner, when I last saw you, and it isn’t

so very long ago, you told me that my husband was not a

concert-player, which was exactly what I had heard in

Paris.”
“I didn’t go quite so far as that, surely, did I?” Mr.

Shinner softly insinuated. He might have been pouring

honey from his mouth. “Surely I didn’t say quite that?

And perhaps I had been too much influenced by Paris.”
“Yes, you said he wasn’t a concert-player and never

would be——”
“Don’t rub it in, madam,” said Mr. Shinner merrily.

”Peccavi.”
“What’s that?”
“Nothing, nothing, madam,” he disclaimed.
“And you said there were far too many violinists on the

market, and that it was useless for a French player to offer

himself to the London musical public. And I don’t know

what you didn’t say.”
“But I didn’t know then that your husband would have

such a success in Germany.”
“What difference does that make?”
“Madam,” said Mr. Shinner, “it makes every difference.”
“But England and Germany hate each other. At least

they despise each other. And what’s more, nearly everybody

in Germany was talking about going to war this

summer. I was told they are all ready to invade England

after they have taken Paris and Calais. We heard it

everywhere.”
“I don’t know anything about any war,” said Mr.

Shinner with tranquillity. “But I do know that the London

musical public depends absolutely on Germany. The

only first-class instrumentalist that England has ever produced

had no success here until he went to Germany and

Germanised his name and himself and announced that he

despised England. Then he came back, and he has caused a

furore ever since. So far as regards London, a success in

Karlsruhe, Wiesbaden, Leipzig, Dusseldorf, and so on, is

worth far more than a success in the Queen’s Hall. Indeed—can

you get a success in the Queen’s Hall without a

success in these places first? I doubt it. Your husband

now has London at his feet. Not Paris, though he may

capture Paris after he has captured London. But London

certainly. He cannot find a better agent than myself. All

artists like me, because I understand. You see, my mother

was harpist to the late Queen.”
“But——”
“Your husband is assuredly a genius, madam!” Mr.

Shinner stood up in his enthusiasm, and banged his left fist

with his right palm.
“Yes, I know that,” said Audrey. “But you are such

an expensive luxury.”
Mr. Shinner pushed away the accusation with both

hands. “Madam, madam, I shall take all the risks. I

should not dream, now, of asking for a cheque on account.

On the contrary, I should guarantee a percentage of the

gross receipts. Perhaps I am unwise to take risks—I dare

say I am—but I could not bear to see your husband in the

hands of another agent. We professional men have our

feelings.”
“Don’t cry, Mr. Shinner,” said Audrey impulsively. It

was not a proper remark to make, but the sudden impetuous

entrance of Musa himself, carrying his violin case,

eased the situation.
“There is a man which is asking for you outside in the

corridor,” said Musa to his wife. “It is the gardener,

Aguilar, I think. I have brought all the luggage, not excluding

that which was lost at Hamburg.” He had a

glorious air, and was probably more proud of his still

improving English and of his ability as a courier than of

his triumphs on the fiddle. “Ah!” Mr. Shinner was

bowing before him.
“This is Mr. Shinner, the agent, my love,” said Audrey.

“I’ll leave you to talk to him. He sees money in you.”
In the passage the authentic Aguilar stood with Miss

Ingate.
“Here’s Mr. Aguilar,” said Miss Ingate. “I’m just

going into No. 37, Madame Piriac’s room. Don’t you think

Mr. Aguilar looks vehy odd in London?”
“Good morning, Aguilar. You in town on business?”
Aguilar touched his forehead. It is possible that he

looked very odd in London, but he was wearing a most

respectable new suit of clothes, and might well have passed

for a land agent.
“’Mornin’, ma’am. I had to come up because I couldn’t

get delivery of those wallpapers you chose. Otherwise all

the repairs and alterations are going on as well as could

be expected.”
“And how is your wife, Aguilar?”
“She’s nicely, thank ye, ma’am. I pointed out to the

foreman that it would be a mistake to make the dining-room

door open the other way, as the architect suggested.

But he would do it. However, I’ve told you, ma’am. It’ll

only have to be altered back. Perhaps I ought to tell you

that I took the liberty of taking a fortnight’s holiday,

ma’am. It’s the only holiday I ever did take, except the

annual day off for the Colchester Rose Show, which is

perhaps more a matter of business with a head gardener

than a holiday, as ye might say. My wife wanted me in

London.”
“She’s not caught yet?”
“No’m. And I don’t think as she will be, not with me

about. I never did allow myself to be bossed by police, and

I always been too much for ’em. And as I’m on the

matter, ma’am, I should like to give you notice as soon

as it’s convenient. I wouldn’t leave on any account till that

foreman’s off the place; he’s no better than a fool. But as

soon afterwards as you like.”
“Certainly, Aguilar. I was quite expecting it. Where

are you going to live?”
“Well, ma’am, I’ve got hold of a little poultry run

business in the north of London. It’ll be handy for Holloway

in case—And Jane asked me to give you this letter,

ma’am. I see her this morning.”
Audrey read the note. Very short, it was signed

“Jane” and “Nick,” and dated from a house in Fitzroy

Street. It caused acute excitement in Audrey.
“I shall come at once,” said she.
Getting rid of Aguilar, she knocked at the door of

No. 37.
“Read that,” she ordered Miss Ingate and Madame

Piriac, giving them the note jointly.
“And are you going?” said Miss Ingate, nervous and

impressed.
“Of course,” Audrey answered. “Don’t they ask me

to go at once? I meant to write to my cousins at Woodbridge

and my uncles in the colonies, and tell them all that

I was settling down at last. And I meant to look at those

new flats in Park Lane with Musa. But I shall have to

leave all that for the present. Also my lunch.”
“But, darling,” put in Madame Piriac, who had been

standing before the dressing-table trying on a hat. “But,

darling, it is very serious, this matter. What about your

husband?”
“He’ll keep,” said Audrey. “He’s had his turn. I

must have mine now. I haven’t had a day off from being

a wife for ever so long. And it’s a little enervating, you

know. It spoils you for the fresh air.”
“I imagined to myself that you two were happy in an

ideal fashion,” murmured Madame Piriac.
“So we are!” said Audrey. “Though a certain coolness

did arise over the luggage this morning. But I don’t

want to be ideally happy all the time. And I won’t be. I

want—I want all the sensations there are; and I want to

be everything. And I can be. Musa understands.”
“If he does,” said Miss Ingate, “he’ll be the first

husband that ever did.” Her lips were sardonic.
“Well, of course,” said Audrey nonchalantly, “he is.

Didn’t you know that?... And didn’t you tell me not

to forget Lady Southminster?”
“Did I?” said Miss Ingate.
Audrey heard voices in the corridor. Musa was parting

from a subservient Shinner. Also the luggage was bumping

along the carpet. She called her husband into No. 37

and kissed him rather violently in front of Madame Piriac

and Miss Ingate, and showed him the note. Then she

whispered to him, smiling.
“What’s that you’re whispering?” Miss Ingate archly

demanded.
“Nothing. I was only asking him to come and help

me to open my big trunk. I want something out of it.

Au revoir, you two.”
“What do you think of it all, Madame Piriac?” Miss

Ingate inquired when the pair were alone.
“‘All the sensations there are!’ ‘Everything!’”

Madame Piriac repeated Audrey’s phrases. “One is forced

to conclude that she has an appetite for life.”
“Yes,” said Miss Ingate, “she wants the lion’s share of

it, that’s what she wants. No mistake. But of course she’s

young.”
“I was never young like that.”
“Neither was I! Neither was I!” Miss Ingate asseverated.

“But something vehy, vehy strange has come over

the world, if you ask me.”
